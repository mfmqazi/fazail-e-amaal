I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br><br>0 <br>22 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of ~ a r d s h i ~ s  23 <br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br><br></p></div>"

Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>26 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>27 <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br><br>28 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br><br></p></div>"

When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse: <br>\"Lo! I, indeed I am Alfah. There is none worthy of <br>worship savz Me. So serve me and establish Salaat for <br>My remembrance.\" <br>He said: \"Alright, take me to Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came out from insidwand said: <br>\"0,'Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday (on Thurs- <br>day night) the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>prayed to Allah, '0,Allah strengthen Islam with either <br>'Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest'. It seems <br>that his prayer has been answered in your favour.\" <br>'Umar then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and embraced Islam on Friday morning. 'Umar's Islam <br>was a terrible blow to the morale of the unbelievers, but <br>still the Muslims were few in number and the whole coun- <br>try was against them. The disbelievers intensified ,their <br>efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims and the <br>extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on <br>their side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new, <br>and returned to their country. On approaching Mecca, they <br>learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions wen: <br>going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to <br>Abyssinia and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protec- <br>tion of a few inflyential people. This is known as the first <br>migration to Abyssinia. Later on, a bigger group of eighty- <br>three men and eighteen women emigrated to Abyssinia <br>(separately). This is called the second emigration to that <br>country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. <br>The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought <br>of peace enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They <br>sent a delegation to Abyssinia with handsome presents for <br>the king, his courtiers and the clergy. The delegation first <br>met the chiefs and the priests and, by offering them pres- <br>ents, succeeded in winning the court officials to their side. <br>Having thus made their way to the royal court, they pros- <br>trated themselves before the king and then presenting the <br>gifts put their case before him. They &id: <br>\"0,king! A few foolish lads of our community have re- <br>nounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an <br>absolutely new religion, which is opposed to'our as <br>well as your religions. They have come and-settled in <br>your country. The nobility of Mecca, their own parents <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>32 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they <br>could make to the charges brought against them. Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) rose and addressed the king thus: <br>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither <br>knew Allah nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped <br>stones. We used to eat carrion and commit all sorts of <br>undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did not make <br>good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among <br>us would thrive,at the expense of the weak. Till at last, <br>Allah raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>our reformation. His noble descent, up-right conduct, <br>integrity of purpose, and pure life are only too well <br>known amongst us. He called upon us to worship Al- <br>lah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone- <br>worship. He enjoined upon us right conduct, and for- <br>bade us from indecency. He taught us to tell the truth, <br>to make good our trust, to have regard for our kith and <br>kin, and to do good to our neighbours. From him we <br>learnt to observe Salaat. Fasting, Zakaat and good con- <br>duct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid blood- <br>shed. He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, <br>misappropriating the orphan's heritage, bringing false <br>accusations against others, and all other indecent <br>things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, the won- <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>33 <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\" <br>and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no <br>means hand over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed <br>and disgraced, they held a counsel. One of them said: <br>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's <br>wrath upon their heads.\" <br>Although the others did not agree to sukh a drastic step (for <br>after all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would <br>not listen. The next day, they excited the king by telling <br>him that those heretics denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) <br>and did not believe in his Divinity. The Muslims were <br>again summoned to the court. They were much more dis- <br>tressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief <br>in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam). they said: <br>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him to <br>our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a <br>servant and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which <br>He conveyed to the virgin and pure Maryam.\" <br>Negus said: \"'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does :not say <br>anything beyond that.\" <br>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king <br>would not listen to them. He returned to the de1t:gatioil the <br><br>34 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>37 <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br><br>33 <br>38 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>the musjid.\" \t<br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br><br>40 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br><br>42 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>43 <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>44 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness. <br>This is to meditate over the greatness of Allah. If this is <br>done, it becomes very easy- to perform all other acts of <br>righteousness with full sincerity. Is it so very difficult to <br>devote a few minutes, out of the twenty four hours of a day <br>at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation? <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passing <br>near the ruins of Thamud during Tabuk expedition: <br>The Tabuk expedition is one of the major campaigns of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and the last one <br>in which he personally took part. When he received the <br>news that the Caesar (of Rome) had mustered a large force <br>to crush the power of Islam and was on his way (through <br>Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah <br>to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 <br>A.H., the devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the <br>weather was hot and the fighting was expected to be very <br>tough. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made an <br>open declaration that the Muslims should gather in <br>strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman <br>Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the <br>equipment of the expedition. It was on this occasion that <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>45 <br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>4<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not even <br>dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on ac- <br>count of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. <br>Except the women, children (who were excusable), those <br>who were ordered to stay behind by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, nearly every- <br>body joined the expedition. Also among those left behind <br>were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for <br>themselves, nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) able to provide them with any. It is about such people <br>that Allah says in his Book: <br>\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in <br>sorrow that they could not find means to spend.\" <br>(IX:92) <br>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any <br>excuse whatsoever were three in number. Their story <br>would be presently related. On their way to Syria when the <br>expedition reached the habitat ion of Tharnud, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his face with his shirt <br>and quickened the pace of his camel. He also instructed the <br><br>46 <br>4 \t<br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>4 7<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying: <br>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" <br>Allah's reply to thie was: <br>(*\\ $9)I> bi *ju ji <br>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\" <br>From amongst the .f&thful, there were only three persons <br>who failed to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura- <br>rah bin Rabi, Hilal MR Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Rad- <br>hipallaho anhum). Murarah had orchards of dates, laden <br>with fruit. He pershaded himself to lag behind with the <br>piea: <br>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What <br>possible harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this <br>one?\" <br>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this <br>prevented him from going out. But when he realised his <br>folly, he gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, <br>too, that had caused him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's case was different. Some <br>of his kinsfolk who had been away for a long time had just <br>returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their company <br>that he did not join the expedition. He also had partici- <br>pated in all the campaigns previously and thought (like <br>Murarah) that it would not matter much if he missed just <br>that one campaign. When he came to know of the serious- <br>ness of his default, he made up his mind to sever all his <br>connections with those relatives who had been the cause of <br>that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, <br>which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says: <br>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at the <br>time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had <br>never possessed this number before. It was a habit with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never <br>disclosed the destination of his expeditions, but he <br>would k e e ~  <br>enquiring about the conditions prevailing <br>elsewhere. But this time in view of the distance, the <br>hot season, and the strength of the enemy, he had de- <br>clared his destination, so that preparations could be <br>made thorough and complete. The number of the par- <br>ticipants was so large that it was difficult to note down <br>their names even, so much so, that absentees could <br>hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of <br>Madinah were full of fruit. I intended every morning to <br>make preparation for the journey but, somehow or <br>other, the days passed by and I made no progress. I <br>was satisfied that I had all the necessary means at my <br>disposal and that I would be ready in no time if I once <br>did decide to do so. I was still in this state of indeci- <br>sion when I learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho daihe <br>wasallam) had left with his companions. The idea still <br>lingered in my mind that I would take a day or two to <br>get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination <br>continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in <br>Tabuk drew very near. I then tried to get ready but <br>again, somehow or other, I did not do so. Now, when I <br>came to look at the people left behind, I realised that <br>there was none in Madinah except those who had been <br>condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially <br>exempted from going for certain reasons. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk in-<br>quired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' <br>Somebody said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in <br>wealth and ease has caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az <br><br></p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br>0,<br>13 <br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br><br>14 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely.

As far as our <br>knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's <br>return. I was struck with grief and remorse. Good ex- <br>cuses one after the other entered my mind, and I was <br>sure that I could escape the Prophet's wrath with one <br>of them for the time being, and later on I could pray for <br>forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice of the wise <br>men of my family in the matter. But when I knew that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had actually <br>arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth <br>would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain <br>truth. It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that whenever he returned from a journey <br>he would repair to the musjid, first of all, say two <br>rakaat 'Tahiyyatul musjid' and then stay there for a <br>while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in the <br>musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on <br>solemn oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany <br>him on the campaign. He took them at their words, <br>leaving the rest to Allah. Just then I came and greeted <br>him with 'salaam'. He turned his face with a sardonic <br>smile. I besought him with the words: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! You turn your face from me. By Allah! I am <br>neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my <br>faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. He then <br>said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had <br>you not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly <br>man, I am sure I would escape his displeasure through <br>(seemingly) reasonable excuses, for Allah has endowed <br>me with the gift of the gab. But in your case I am sure <br>that if 1 appease you with a false statement, Allah <br>would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, <br>I am sure that if I displease you by confessing the <br>simple truth, then Allah would very soon blow away <br>your displeasure. I, therefore, make bold to speak the <br>very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all. I had never <br>been so we11 to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking <br>the truth.' He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will <br>decide about you. When I left the musjid, many a man <br>of my clan blamed me and admonished me thus; <br>'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after <br>making some good excuse for once, you had requested <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pray for <br>your goodness, surely his prayer would have sufficed <br>you.' I inquired of them if there were any more people <br>like me. They informed me that there were two other <br>persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, <br>who also had admitted their faults like me and re-<br>ceived the same reply from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I knew that both of them were very <br>good Muslims and had participated in the campaign of <br>Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) issued <br>instructions that none was to speak with the three of <br>us.' <br>It is a cqmmon principle that displeasure is shbwn <br>where some attachment exists, and a reprimand is given <br>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incor- <br>rigible person would be a futile effort. <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho<br>alaihe wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted <br>us. Nobody was prepared to mix with or even speak to <br>us. It seemed as if I was living in a strange land alto- <br>gether. My own birth-place looked like a foreign local- <br>ity and my bosom friends behaved like strangers. 'The <br>earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur'an IX: <br>113)for me. The thing that worried me most was that, <br>if I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not lead my funeral prayer, <br>and if the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) died in <br>the meantime, I would be doomed for ever, with none <br>to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. The <br>other two companions of mine confined themselves to <br>their houses. I was the most daring of the three: I <br>would go to the market, and join the Jamaat for Salaat, <br>but nobody would talk to me. I would approach the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say 'Assa- <br>lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his <br>lips moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete <br>the Salaat by standing close to him, and I would look <br>at him from the corner of my eye to learn if he ever <br>cast a single glance at me. I noticed that when I was <br><br>50 <br>51 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>made over a letter to me from the Christian King of <br>Ghassan. Thus it read: 'We have come to know that <br>your master has ill-treated you. Allah may not-keep <br>you in abasement and in disgrace. You had better come <br>to us. We shall extend all help to you.' When I read <br>this letter, I uttered \"Inna-lillahi-wa-Inna-ilaihi-raaji-<br>oon\" To Allah we belong and to Him is our return; and <br>said; 'So my state of affairs (had) reached such an ebb <br>that even the Kafirs were aspiring to draw me away <br>from Islam.' I codld not imagine a calamity worse than <br>that. I went and threw the letter into an oven. There- <br>after I presented myself to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and exclaimed: '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Your indifference towards me has lowered me to such <br>an extent that even the Kafirs are building up their <br>hopes over me.\" <br>When forty days had passed in this condition, a mess- <br>enger of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>brought me this mandate: 'Be separated from your <br>wife' I inquired, 'Am I to divorce her?' He replied: 'No, <br>only be separated.' A similar message was delivered to <br>my other two companions as well. I consequently said <br>to my wife: 'Go to your parents and wait till Allah de- <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>sitting on the roof of my house stricken with grief, and <br>the earth had 'straightened' for me and the life had <br>become dismal for me, I heard a crier's cry from over <br>the top of the mount Sula; 'Happy tidings to you, 0, <br>Kaab.' The moment I heard this, I fell prostrate on the <br>ground and tears of joy rolled down my cheeks, as I <br>understood that the ordeal was now over. In fact, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had announced <br>the Divine forgiveness for all three of us after the <br>Salaat that morning. At this, a person ran up the top of <br>the mountain and yelled out the cry that had reached <br>me. Thereafter, a rider came galloping to deliver the <br>same happy news to me. 1 gave away as a gift the <br>clothes, I was wearing, to the messenger of glad tid- <br>ings. I swear by Allah I had no other clothes in my pos- <br>session at that time. I dressed up by borrowing clothes <br>from some friend and went to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). As I entered the musjid, the people <br>in the audience of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ran to congratulate me. Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was the first to approach me. He shook my hand <br>with a warmth that I shall never forget. Thereafter I of-<br>fered my salutation to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I found his face beaming and radiant like <br><br>52 \t<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives. <br>(2) \t Their devotion and obedience to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallabo alaihe wasallam). For full fifty days the <br>whole Muslim community, even their nearest and <br>dearest, would not speak to the three persons, in <br>obedience to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) orders. The three persons themselves went <br>most steadfastly through the ordeal imposed on <br>them. <br>I <br>(3) \t Their strong faith. Kaab was so much perturbed <br>when he received the letter from the Christian <br>King, exciting him against the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). His words and his action at that <br>time are a testimony to the strong faith in his <br>heart. <br>Let us search our hearts and see how much devotion <br>we have in them for the observance of the duties we owe to <br>Islam. Leaving aside Zakaat and Hajj, which involve the <br>sacrifice of money, take the case of Salaat alone, which is <br>the most important pillar of Islam after Imaan. How many <br>of us are particular about it? <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>53 <br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me, you will see how I <br>treat you!' It then closes upon him so much that his <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other. As <br>many as seventy serpents are then set upon him, to <br>keep biting him till the Day of Resurrection. These ser- <br>pents are so venomous that if one of them happened to <br>spurt its venom upon the earth, not a single blade of <br>grass would ever grow.\" <br>After this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The grave is either a garden of Paradise or a pit of <br>Hell.\" <br>Fear of Allah is the basic and essential qualification of <br>a Muslim. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ad- <br>vised the believers to remember death, off and on, and to <br>keep the fear of Allah ever present in their hearts. <br>11. \tHadhrat Hanzlah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Pear of Nifaq: <br>Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) when he delivered a sermon. Our hearts <br><br>54 <br>55 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I <br>have turned Munafiq, 0 Prophet of Allah!' He inquired <br>about the matter, and I repeated what I had said to Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Thereupon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'By Him Who con- <br>trols my life, if you could keep up for all times the <br>fervour aroused in you when you are with me, angels <br>would greet you in your walks and in your beds. But, <br>0,Hanzlah! This is rare! This is rare!\" <br>We have to attend to our personal and impersonal <br>worldly affairs, and therefore we cannot be contemplating <br>the Hereafter for all the twenty-four hours of the day. <br>According to what has been said by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), complete absorption in the Hereafter is <br>rare, and it should not be expected by all. It is only for the <br>angels to remain in the same state for ever. In case of men, <br>the state of their mind changes with circumstances and en- <br>vironments. But we can see from this story how anxious <br>the Sahabah were about the condition of their Imaan. Hanz- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) suspects Nifaq in himself wher, he <br>feels that the condition of his mind at home is not the same <br>as it is when he is with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse: <br>\"And when the heaven splitteth asunder and beco- <br>meth rosy like red hide\", <br>(LV: 37) <br>the hair of his body stood on end, and he was nearly <br>choked, with excessive weeping. He would cry and say: <br>\"Alas; what will happen to me on the day when even <br>the Heaven splitteth asunder. Woe is me!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alai-he-wasallam) said to him: <br>\"Your crying has made even the angels weep\". <br>Once an Ansari sat and wept after Tahajjud, saying: <br>\"I cry to Allah for protection from the fire of Hell\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have made the angels weep today\". <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>once weeping. His wife also began to weep on seeing him <br>in this condition. He enquired of her: <br>\"Why are you weeping?\" <br><br>56 <br>57 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse: <br>\"Every soul will taste of death\" <br>(111:185) <br>he began to repeat it again and again. He heard a voice from <br>a corner of the room saying: <br>\"How often are you going to repeat this verse? Your <br>recitation has already caused the death of four Jinns\". <br>It is reported about another Sheikh that (while reciting <br>the Qur'an) when he reached the verse: <br>\"Then are they returned unto Allah, their Lord, the <br>Just, is not His the Command?\" <br>(VI:62) <br>he gave out a cry, shivered and breathed his last. <br>There are many stories of this type. Fudhail, a famous <br>Sheikh, says: <br>\"Fear of Allah leads to everything that is good\". <br>Shibli, another Sheikh of high position, says: <br>\"Whenever I have felt Allah's fear in me, I have found <br>a fresh door of knowledge and wisdom opened for <br>me\". <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear <br>from the fear of Allah is safe from entrance into the fire <br>of Hell.\" <br>He also said: <br>\"When a Muslim shivers with the fear of Allah, his <br>sins fall away from him like the falling leaves of a <br>tree.\" <br>The dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"A person weeping with fear of Allah cannot go to Hell <br>until milk goes back into the teats (which is an im-<br>possibility)\". <br>Hadhrat Uqbah bin Amir (Radhiyallaho anho) once in- <br>quired of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"What is the way to salvation?\" <br>He replied: \"Hold your tongue, stay indoors and cry over <br>your sins.\" <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once inquired of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Is there anybody among your followers who will go to <br>Paradise without reckoning?\" <br><br>58 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that, when he wept, he smeared his tears over <br>his face and beard saying: <br>\"I have heard that the fire of Hell does not touch the <br>place touched by these tears.\" <br>Thabit Banani was suffering from a disease of the eyes. <br>His doctor said to him: <br>\"Your eyes would be all right, provided you do not <br>weep in future.\" <br>He replied: \"What is the good of an eye if it cannot shed <br>tears.\" <br>Yazid bin Maisarah (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>'There can be seven reasons for weeping viz., extreme <br>joy, insanity, extreme pain, horror, artifice, intoxica- <br>tion and fear of Allah. A single tear shed in the fear of <br>Allah is sufficient to quench oceans of fire (of Hell).\" <br>Hadhrat Ka'ab Ahbar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I <br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>59 3= <br>Cl a <br>There are numerous other sayings of the Saints and <br>'E;i<br>4 <br>other pious people, indicating that weeping because of the <br>3,<br>rm<br>fear of Allah, and over one's sins, is very effective and ben- <br>eficial in attaining spiritual elevation. We should not, how- <br>ever, lose hope in Allah. His Mercy is all-embracing. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal!aho anho) says: <br>\"If it be announced on the Day of Judgement that all <br>except one individual shall go to Hell, my expectation <br>of the Mercy of Allah would make me hope that I may <br>be that chosen one. Again, if it be announced on that <br>day that all except one individual shall go to Paradise, <br>then my sins would make me fear that I may be that <br>condemned one.\" <br>It is therefore necessary that we should combine fear and <br>hope together in our hearts. Especially when the time of <br>death is apprdaching, we should have more hope than fear. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"None of you should die, except with a strong hope in <br>the Mercy of Allah.\" <br>When Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Radhiyallaho anho) ap- <br>proached his end, he sent for his son and asked him to read <br>to him the Ahaadith that induce hope in Allah and His <br>Mercy. <br>\"By Him who holds my life in His (hands), I love to <br>weep for fear of Allah, with tears flowing down my <br>cheeks, rather than spend a mountain of gold in <br>charity\" <br><br>CHAPTER I11 <br>ABSTINENCE AND SELF-DENIAL OF THE SAHABAH <br>There is such a wealth of Ahadith about this aspect of <br>the Prophet's life that it is really difficult to chose a few ex- <br>amples. He said: <br>\"Abstinence is an asset of a Mo'min.\" <br>1. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Dislike <br>for gold: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"My Lord offered to turn the mounts of Mecca into <br>gold for me. But my supplication to Him was; '0, <br>Allah! I like to eat one day and feel hungry the next, so <br>that I may cry before Thee and remember Thee when I <br>am hungry; and be grateful to Thee and glorify Thee <br>when my hunger is gone!\" <br>Thus said our Prophet '(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>We profess to follow him and are proud of being in the fold <br>of his Ummat. Isn't. it incumbent upon us to follow him in <br>practice also? <br>2. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Life of <br>Abstinence: <br>Once, the prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided to stay away from his wives for one month, as he was <br>displeased with them on some account. He lived for that <br>one month in a separate room in the upper storey. A <br>rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>divorced his wives got afloat among the Sahabah. When 'U <br>mar heard of this, he came running to the musjid and <br>found the Sahabah sitting in groups, struck with grief over <br>the Prophet's suffering. He went to his daughter Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), who was a wife of the Prophet, and <br>found her weeping in her room. He said to her: <br>\"Why are you weeping now? Have I not been warning <br>you all these .times to refrain from any act likely to <br>cause the Prophet's displeasure'?\" <br>Ch. 111:Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 61 <br>He returned to the musjid and found some of the Sahabah <br>sitting near the pulpit and weeping. He sat there for some <br>time, but could not sit for long due to his excessive grief. <br>He went towards the room where the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was staying. He found Rabah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave, sitting on the steps. He asked him to go <br>and inquire of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>he could allow 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to see him. <br>Rabah went inside and came back to inform him that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held his peace and <br>said nothing. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>musjid and sat near the pulpit. Again the anguish eating <br>his heart would not allow him any rest, and he requested <br>Rabah to convey his request to the Prophet a second time. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did not make any <br>answer this time too. After tarrying near the pulpit for <br>some time more, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) craved per- <br>mission to see the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the third time. This time, his request was acceded to. When <br>he was ushered in, he saw the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) lying on a date leaf matting. The crossed pattern <br>of the matting could easily be seen imprinted on his hand- <br>some body. He had a leather bag filled with the bark of the <br>datepalm as his pillow. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I greeted him with Assalamo alaikum and inquired: <br>'Have you divorced your wives, 0,Prophet of Allah?\" <br>He answered in the negative. Much relieved, then I <br>made bold to remark, a bit amusingly; '0, Prophet of <br>Allah! we the Qureysh have always been having the <br>upper hand over our women, but in case of the Ansar <br>of Madinah, it is the women who have the upper hand. <br>Our women have also got influenced by the women <br>over here'. I said a few more similar things which <br>made him smile. I noticed that the contents of his <br>room consisted of only three pieces of tanned skin and <br>a handful of barley lying in a corner. I looked about, <br>but I failed to find anything else. I began to weep. He <br>said; 'Why are you weeping?' I replied: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! why should I not weep? I can see the mat's pat- <br>tern imprinted on your body, and I am also beholding <br>all that you have got in this room. 0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Pray that Allah may grant ample provisions for us. The <br>Persians and the Romans who have no true faith and <br><br>62 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter? Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next. I implored him: '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! Ask forgiveness for me. I was really <br>in the wrong\" <br>Look at the household effects of the sovereign in this <br>world and in the hereafter, and the beloved Prophet of <br>Allah. See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>\"It consisted of a skin filled with the bark of date- <br>palm.\" <br>The same question was put to Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha); <br>she said: <br>\"It consisted of a piece of canvas, which I spread <br>doublefolded under him. Once I laid it fourfold in an <br>effort to make it more comfortable. The next morning <br>he asked me: 'What did you spread under me last <br>night?' I replied! 'The same canvas, but I had four- <br>folded it instead of the customary double fold.' He <br>said: 'Keep it as it was before. The additional softness <br>stands in the way of getting up for Tahajjud.\"' <br>Now let us look around and survey the furniture of our <br>bedrooms. We, who live in so much comfort, never hesitate <br>to complain of hard times, instead of being grateful and <br>more obedient to Allah for his bounties. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) in a State <br>of Hunger <br>. <br>Once, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) after <br>wiping his nose with piece of fine linen remarked to him- <br>self: <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>5 <br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>during the night; his wife and his servant taking turns with <br>him in the prayers. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (~adhiyallaho anho) Daily Al- <br>lowance from the Bait-ul Ma1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was a cloth <br>merchant and lived by that trade. On the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), people selected him <br>as the Khalifah. Next day with some cloth slung on his <br>arms, he was proceeding to the market as usual when <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) met him in the way. <br>'Urnar: <br>\"Where are you going to, Abu Bakr?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"To the market\". <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"If you get busy with your trade, who will <br>carry out the duties of the caliphate?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t \"How am I to feed my family then?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Let's go to Abu 'Ubaidah (In charge of\"Bait-ul- <br>Mal), who will fix some daily allowance for <br>you from the 13ait-ul-Mal.\" <br>They both went to Abu 'Ubaidah (Kadhiyallaho anho). <br><br>64 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5 <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"When Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was selected as <br>Khalifah. he said to the people: 'You well know that I <br>live bv trade, and my income therefrom is sufficient to <br>meet mv expenses. Now I have to devote my full time <br>to the affairs of the state and therefore my family al- <br>lowance shall be paid from the 'Bait-ul-Mal.'\" <br>~ a d h r a tA'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"At the time of his death, Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) directed rjle to hand over to his successor all that <br>was issued to him from the Bait-ul-Mal for his house- <br>hold needs. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>left no cash after him. Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: <br>\"Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) left a milch she-camel, <br>a bowl and a servant.\" <br>A(;c;ording to some other narrators. he left a bedding also. <br>When all these were made over to 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), his successor, he remarked: <br>\"Mav Allah be merciful to Abu Bakr! He has set a pre-<br>cedent for his successors which is very hard t o  <br>follow.\" <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali. Hadhrat <br>Usman, Hadhrat Zubair and Hadhrat Talhah (Radhivallaho <br>anhum) once proposed that Hadhrat Umar's (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) allowance might be increased, as it was hardlv suffi- <br>cient for him. but nobody dared to suggest that to Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho). People approached Ummul- <br>momineen Hadhrat Hafsah (radhivallaho anha), his daugh- <br>ter, and requested her to ascertain 'Umar's (Kadhivallaho <br>anho) reaction to the suggestion without mentioning their <br>names to him. When Hadhrat Hafsah (Kadhiyallaho anha) <br>talked about it to tladhrat IJmar (Kadhivallaho anho), he <br>became angry and said: <br>\"Who are the persons making this suggestion?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Let me first know your opinion.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If I knew them, I would smite them on their faces <br>I-jafsah! just tell me what was the Prophet's best dress <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a pair of reddish brown clothes, which the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wore on Friday or <br>while receiving some envoy.\" <br><br>66 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What was the best of food that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) ever took at your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Simple barley bread was the only food we used to <br>take. One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah! Go and tell these people that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has set a standard by his <br>personal example. I must follow him. My example and <br>that of my other two companions viz., the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and Abu Bakr (Radhival- <br>laho anho) is like that of three men travelling on the <br>same road. The first man started with a provision and <br>reached the goal. The second followed the first and <br>joined him. Now the third is on his way. If he follows <br>their way, he will also join them, otherwise he can <br>never reach them;' <br>Such is the life of the person who was a dread for the <br>monarchs of the world. What a simple life he lived! Once <br>he was reciting the Khutbah when it was noticed that his <br>lower cloth had as many as twelve patches, including one <br>of leather. Once he came late for his Jumu'ah prayer and <br>told the congregation: <br>\"Excuse me, people! I got late because I was washing <br>my clothes and had no other clothes to put on.\" <br>Once he was having his meal when 'Utbah bin Abi <br>Farqad (Radhiyallaho anho) asked permission to see him. <br>Ch. III: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 67 <br>He allowed him in and invited him to share the food with <br>him. 'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when <br>vieing with one another in running after the luxuries of this <br>world. <br>6. <br>Bilal's (Radhiyallaho anho) story about the Prophet: <br>Someone inquired of Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) how <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) met his expenses. <br>He replied: <br>\"He never kept back anything for future use. I arranged <br>money for him. Whenever a needy person, whether <br>hungry or naked, came to him, he would make him <br>over to me and I would then arrange for his needs by <br>borrowing money from somebody. This is what usually <br>happened. Once a Mushrik came to me and said: 'Look <br>here! I have a lot of money to spare. Don't borrow <br>money from anvbody else. Whenever you need it, <br>come straight to me.' I exclaimed: 'This is indeed fine.' <br>I began to borrow money from him to meet the needs <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). One day, <br>after I had taken mv Wudhu and was about to call <br>Azaan, the same Mushrik accompanied bv some <br>people came and shouted, '0,Negro!' When I attended <br>to him. he began to abuse me, using filthv language <br>and said: 'How manv davs are left of this month? 'I <br><br>68 <br>Stories of the Saltaabah \t<br>Ch. Ill: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 69 <br>said: 'It is about to finish. 'He said most insolently: <br>'Look here! there are only four days left of this month. <br>If you fail to clear up your debts by the end of the <br>month. 1 shall take you as my slave for my money and <br>then you will be grazing sheep as you have been doing <br>before.' After saying this he went away. I remained <br>melancholy and full of grief throughout the day. After <br>Isha when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was alone, I went and narrated the story to him, <br>saying: '0, Prophet of Allah! you have nothing with <br>you. nor can I arrange any money from somewllere so <br>quickly. I am afraid the Mushrik will disgrace me. I <br>therefore intend to keep away for such time as you get <br>sufficient money to clear the debts.' I went home, took <br>my sword, shield, and shoes, and waited for the morn- <br>ing to make for some other place. lust before dawn, <br>somebody came to me and said. 'Hurry up. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wants you.' I hur-<br>ried to the musjid and found four loaded camels sitting <br>near the Prophet. He said: 'Good news. Bilal. Allah has <br>made arrangements for clearing your debts. Take these <br>camels with their load. The Chief of Fidak has sent <br>them as a gift to me.' I thanked Allah and took the <br>camels and cleared up all the debts. In the meantime, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept sitting in <br>the musjid. When I returned, I said: 'Alhamdulillah.' <br>All the debts are now clear, 0.Prophet of Allah' He in- <br>quired: 'Is there anvthing left from the gift?\" I said, <br>\"Yes, somethirlg is still left.\" He said. \"Go and spend <br>that as well. I shall not go home until the whole lot is <br>spent.' The Propket kept sitting in the musjid all day <br>long. After Isha he inquired again if everything had <br>been spent. I said: 'Something is still left unspent. A <br>few of the poor have not turned up so far.' He slept in <br>the nlusjid that night. Next dav after Isha'a he again <br>called me to him and said: 'Bilal! Is everything fin- <br>ished now?\" I said: 'Yes, Allah has blessed you with <br>peace. Everything is now spent and gone.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) begail to hymn the Glory <br>of Allah over this news, for he did not like death to <br>overtake him while any of the riches were in his pos- <br>session. He then went home and met his family.\" <br>It is common with pious people that they do not like to <br>keep any wealth with them. How could the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), being the fountain-head of all piety, <br>like to keep anything in his possession? It is said of Mau- <br>lana Abdur Rahim (May Allah have mercy on him), a Saint <br>of our time, that all that he received as gifts from the <br>people was immediately spent by him and he did not keep <br>anything for himself. A few days before his death, he gave <br>over all his clothes to one of his attendants and said: <br>\"If I need to wear any clothes in my life. I shall borrow <br>them from you.\" <br>And I also know about my late father, who whenever had <br>any money left after Maghrib, would give it to someone of <br>his creditors (he was several thousand rupees in debt) and <br>would say 'I would not like to keep this source of trouble <br>with me for the night.' <br>e <br>7. \t<br>Another story of Hadhrat Abu Hurairah's (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) Hunger: <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I wish you had seen some of us living on a starvation <br>diet for several days, successively, so much so that we <br>could not even stand erect. On account of spasms of <br>hunger, I would lie on my belly and press my stomach <br>against the ground or keep a stone tied to mv abdomen. <br>Once, I intentionally sat in wait for some notable <br>people to pass that way. As Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) came along, I joined in conversation <br>with him, intending to continue the talk till we reach <br>his home, where I expected him to invite me to share <br>his meals, as was his wont. But his answer was brief, <br>and my plan did not work. The same thing happened <br>with Hadhrat Umar, (Radhiyallaho anho) when he <br>chanced that way. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) himself was the next to come. A smile spread <br>on his face when he saw me, for he at once divined <br>why I was sitting there. 'Come with me, Abu Hurairah', <br>lie said, and I accompanied him to his house. He took <br>me in. where a bowl of milk was brought before him. <br>He asked, 'Who brought this milk?\" and was told that <br>somebody had sent it as a present. HA bade me to go <br>and invite all the Suffah friends. The Suffah people <br>were treated as everyone's guests by all the Muslims. <br>I'hev were such persons who had neither hearth nor <br>home of their own, nor anv other means of livelihood. <br><br></p></div>"

The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>and returned the same to me, till all of them were <br>served. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>held the,goblet in his own hand, smiied at me, and re- <br>marked, 'Only two of us are left now!' 'Quite so', I re-<br>plied. 'Then take it,' he said. I needed no second <br>bidding, and took enough. He exhorted me to have <br>more, and I had my fill; till I declared that I had no <br>room for any more. He then took hold of the bowl, and <br>drained the still remaining milk.\" <br>I <br>8. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) opinion <br>about two persons: <br>Some people were sitting with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) when a person passed that way. The <br>Prophet (Sailallaho alaihe wasallam) asked of the company: <br>I <br>\"What do you think of this person?\" <br>They replied: <br>, <br>\"0.Pro het of Allah! He is the scion of a good family. <br>: <br>By Alla R, he is such that if he seeks in marriage the <br>hand of a woman of the most illustrious family, ne <br>would not be rejected. If he recommends anybody, his <br>recommendation would be readily accepted.\" <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>people, are far from the path of Allah. It is said in Hadith: <br>\"It will be the end of this world when there remains <br>not a single soul to hymn the name of Allah. It is by <br>the holy name of Allah that the system of this universe <br>is running.\" <br>9. \t<br>Privations go with love for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) <br>A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! I love you so much.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Think well before you say this.\" <br>The person: <br>\"I have already given thought. I love you very much, <br>0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Think once <br>again before you declare such a thing.\" <br><br>72 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con- <br>tingent with food, Hadhrat Qais (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>buying three camels daily from his own men, to feed the <br>Mujahideen, with a promise to pay on return to Madinah. <br>The Amir seeing that the slaughter of camels would de- <br>prive the party of their only means of transport, prohibited <br>him to do so. He collected the dates that had been left with <br>each person and stored them in a bag. He would issue one <br>date to each man as his daily ration. When Hadhrat Jahir <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) later on narrated this story to the <br>people, one of his aud?ence inquired: <br>\"How did you manage to live upon one date only for <br>the whole day?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"We longed even for that one date, when the whole <br>stock was exhausted. We were on the verge of starva- <br>tion. We moistened the dry tree-leaves with water and <br>ate them.\" <br>When they reached this stage, Allah had mercy on them, <br>for He always brings ease after every hardship, provided it <br>is endured patiently. A big fish known as \"Ambar\" was <br>thrown out of the sea for them. The fish was so big that <br>they lived on it for eighteen days altogether. They also <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 73 2- 4<br>2 s  <br>filled their satchels with the remaining portion, which -22 <br>lasted them right up to Madinah. When the episode was $2<br>* <br>narrated to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he <br>said: <br>\"The fish was a provision arranged for you by Allah.\" <br>Difficulties and hardships are not uncommon in this <br>world to the people of Allah; these are bound to come. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"The worst trials in this world are reserved for the <br>Prophets, then for those who are next to them, and <br>then for those who are best of the rest.\" <br>The trial of a person is proportionate to his position near <br>Allah, and He bestows solace and comfort by His Grace and <br>Mercy after each trial. Look how much our ancestors in <br>Islam have suffered in the path of Allah. They had to live <br>on leaves of trees, starve and shed their blood in the service <br>of the true faith, which we now fail to preserve. <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>75 <br>r <br>CHAPTER IV <br>PIETY AND SCRUPULOUSNESS <br>The habits and traits of character of the Sahabah, as a <br>whole, are worth following, as they were the people <br>specially chosen and selected by Allah to be the compan- <br>ions of His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been sent in the best period of human history.\" <br>The time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>itself a blessed period, and the people favoured with his <br>company were really the cream of that age. <br>? <br>1. \t The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepts a <br>woman's invitation: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) 'was once re- <br>turning from a funeral, when a woman invited him to par- <br>take of some food at her house. He went in with some of <br>his Sahabah. When the food was served, it was noticed that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was trying to <br>chew a morsel, but it would simply not go down his throat. <br>He said: <br>\"It seems that the animal has been slaughtered without <br>the permission of its owner.\" <br>The woman said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I had asked a man to purchase a <br>goat for me from the market, but he could not obtain <br>one. My neighbour also had recently purchased a goat. <br>So I sent the man thither with some money to buy the <br>! <br>same from him: My neighbour was out and his wife <br>made over the goat to my man.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) directed her to go <br>and serve the meat to the captives. <br>It has been noted of pious and saintly Muslims that <br>I <br>food obtained from doubtful sources would simply not go <br>down their throats. So this is not such a surprising thing in <br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>the case of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who is <br>the fountain-head of all piety. <br>2. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Sleepless <br>Night: <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spent a <br>sleepless night. He would turn from side to side and could <br>not sleep. His wife asked him: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Why can you not sleep?\" <br>He responded: <br>\"A date was lying about. I took it up and ate it, lest it <br>should be wasted. Now I am troubled lest it might be <br>from Sadaqah.\" <br>Most probably the date belonged to the Prophet him- <br>self, but because people sent him their 'Sadaqah' as well <br>(for distribution), he could not sleep with the apprehension <br>that it might be of Sadaqah. This is the last word in <br>scruples from the master himself, that he could not sleep <br>because of a suspicion in his mind. How would it go with <br>those who claim themselves to be the slaves of that very <br>master but indulge in usury, corruption, theft, plunder and <br>every other type of 'haraam' business without the least <br>scruple. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and a sooth- <br>sayer's food: <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had a slave <br>who used to give him a portion of his daily income as the <br>masier's share. Once he brought him some food, and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) took a morsel out of it. <br>Then the slave remarked: <br>\"You always enquire about the source of what I bring <br>to you, but today you have not done so.\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I was feeling so hungry that I failed to do that. 'Tell <br>me now, how did you come by this food?\" <br>The slave said: <br>\"Before I embraced Islam, I practised sooth-saying. <br>During those days I came across some people for <br><br>76 \t<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>1 <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'The flesh nourished by haraam food, is des- <br>tined for the fire of Hell.' I, therefore, made haste to <br>vomit this morsel, lest any portion of my body should <br>receive nourishment from it.\" <br>Many stories of this nature have been reported about <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). As he was very <br>scrupulous and would not taste anything but that about <br>which he was perfectly sure, even the slightest doubt about <br>its being 'halal' would make him vomit what he had taken. <br>4. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) vomits out milk <br>of Sadaqah: <br>A person once brought some milk for Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). When he took it, he noted its queer <br>taste, and asked the person as to how he had come in pos- <br>session of the milk. He replied: <br>\"The camels given in Sadaqah were grazing in the <br>desert, and the attendants gave me this milk out of <br>what they got from them.\" <br>LJpon this. I-iadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) put his hand <br>in his throat and vomited all that he had taken. <br>These God-fearing people not only totally abstained <br>from 'haraam' food. but were most anxious to avoid anv <br>w <br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>77 <br>3s:<br>%d<br>i;<br>doubtful morsel finding its way inside them. They could <br>.c2~<br>not dare taking anything that was 'haraam', which is so <br>usual these days. <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Bait-ul-Maal: <br>Ibn-Seereen writes: <br>\"When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he said to his daughter, Hadhrat Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), 'I did not like to take anything <br>from the Bait-ul-Maal, but Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) insisted on it, to relieve me of my occupation, <br>and to enable me to devote nly full time to the duties <br>of the 'Khilafat: and I was left no choice. Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"May Allah bless your father! He has left no chance for <br>anybodv to open his lips against him.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) received his <br>subsistence allowance from the Bait-ul-maal in the interest <br>of all the Muslirns, and that too at the request of the most <br>prominent Sahabah. Again the amount taken was almost <br>the minimum possible, and hardly sufficient for him, as we <br>have already seen in the story (in the last chapter) about his <br>wife's inability to cook one sweet dish during the whole <br>month. In spite of all this he was so scrupulous that he <br>made over his garden to the Bait-ul-nlaal i l l  lieu of ~vhat he <br>had received from the public funds. <br>6. \t<br>The story of Ali bin Ma'bad: (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>Ali bin Ma'bad (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mohaddith. He <br>savs: <br>\"I was living in a rented Iiouse. Once I wrote some- <br>thing which 1 wanted to drv up quicklv. The house <br>walls were of mud and 1 intended to scrape a little <br>mud from there to dry up the ink. But I thought: \"This <br>house is not mine, and I cannot scrape the walls with- <br><br>79 <br>78 \t<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>6 \t<br>Ch. IV:Piety and Scrupulousness <br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder- <br>ness and solitude! How fare you in the other world? <br>How has it gone with you there?' He continued: 'The <br>news from our side is that all you did leave of the <br>wealth and riches here, has long been distributed; your <br>children are orphans; your widows have long since re- <br>married. Now let us hear about you.' He then turned to <br>me: '0 Kumail! If they could speak, they would have <br>informed us that the best provision for the Hereafter is <br>Taqwa.' Tears yelled out of his eyes, as he added: '0 <br>Kumail! The grave is a container of the deeds; hut one <br>realizes it only after death.\" <br>Our good or bad actions are stored up in our graves. It <br>is said in a Hadith that every person meets his good deeds <br>in the grave in the person of an agreeable companion who <br>befriends and consoles him there. But his wicked deeds <br>assume hideous shapes emitting bad smells, which add to <br>his misery. In another Hadith it is said: <br>\"Three things accompany a person to his grave viz: His <br>wealth (as was the prevalent custom among the Arabs <br>of the time), his relatives, and his deeds. His wealth <br>and his relatives turn back after his burial, but his ac- <br>tions go in and stay with him in the grave.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else,' This brother is his <br>wordly wealth. He then questions the last brother in <br>the same strain, who makes response: 'I shall not for- <br>sake you even in your grave; and I shall accompany <br>you into that place of utter solitude. When your deeds <br>are weighed in the balance. I shall forthwith lend my <br>weight to the scale of your good deeds and weigh it <br>down.' This brother is the personification of his good <br>deeds. Now, tell me, which of the brothers you regard <br>to be the most useful to the person?' The Sahabah re- <br>plied: '0, Prophet of Allah! The last brother is really <br>the most useful to him. There is no doubt about it. The <br>other two brothers were of no avail.\" <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) verdict <br>about haraam food: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"As Allah Himself is above all blemishes, likewise. He <br>blesses with His grace only the unblemished thi~igs. He <br>enjoins upon the Muslims, what He has laid 3own for <br>His Prophets. He savs in His Holy Book: <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>80 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>6 <br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah <br>does sometimes grant the prayers of even a Kafir (not to <br>mention the prayer or requests of a sinful Muslim). but it is <br>pnrticularlv the prayer of a pious person that is seldom re- <br>jected. That is the reason why people generally seek the <br>prayers of such persons for themselves. It follows that <br>those who wish to have their prayers often granted must <br>abstain from haraam. No wise person would like to run the <br>risk of his prayers being rejected. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) does not like his <br>wife to weigh musk: <br>I-ladhrat (Jmar (Kadhiyallaho anhn) once received some <br>nli~skfrom Bahrain. I-le said: <br>\"I tvant someone to weigh it, so that it mav be equally <br>distri1)uted among the Muslims.' <br>llis ~viit? said: \"1 shall weigh it..\" <br>tiiiclhriit Umar (Kadhivallaho anho) kept quiet. A little later <br>ht: again asked for someone to weigh the musk, and again <br>his wife volullteered to do so. But he kept quiet this tiine <br>too. C'lrhen she repeated her offer for the third time, he said: <br>\"I do not like your touching the musk with your hands <br>(while weighing it) and rubbing those hands on your <br>body afterwards, as that would amount to something <br>over and above my legitimate share.\" <br>Any other person weighing the musk would, for that <br>matter, have had the same advantage, but Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) did not like this preference particu- <br>larly for any member of his own family. Look at this scru- <br>pulous anxiety to avoid charge of selfishness. <br>A similar story is related about Hadhrat Umar bin <br>Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) (who is known as the <br>second Umar). While he was holding the reins of the Khila- <br>fat, musk belonging to the Bait ul-Maal was being weighed. <br>He closed his own nostrils, with the remark: <br>\"The use of musk is to smell it.\" <br>These were the scruples of the Sahabah, and their suc- <br>cessors, and our elders in Islam. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>dismisses a governor: <br>Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) ap- <br>pointed a person as governor of a province. Somebody re- <br>marked that this person had held the same post under <br>Hajjaj-bin-Yusuf (the notorious blood shedder) also. Hadh- <br>rat Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) immediately <br>issued orders of his dismissal. The man protested: <br>\"I had been with Hajjaj only for a very short time.\" <br>To this, the Khalifa replied: <br>\"His company for a day or even less is sufficient t~ <br>render a man unfit for public service.\" <br>\"A man is known by the companv he keeps.\" The <br>company of pious people leaves an imperceptible impres- <br>sion of piety on the character, and likewise evil company <br>has its evil influence. That is why association with bad <br>people is always discouraged. Even the companv of ani- <br>mals is not without its own effect. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>82 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\" <br>CHAPTER V <br>DEVOTION TO SALAAT <br>Salaat is the most important of all forms of worship. It <br>is, in fact, the first and foremost item to be reckoned with <br>on the Day of Judgement. .The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the only line of demarcation between Kufr <br>and Islam.\" <br>There are many Ahadith about Salaat, which. I have col- <br>lected in a separate book. <br>1. \t Blessings of Nafl (non-obligatory) Prayers: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reported that <br>Allah told him: <br>\"My wrath descends upon a person who bears ill-will <br>towards My friends. And only those are blessed with <br>My love who implicitly carry out Fardh (obligatory) in- <br>junctions. A person keeps on advancing in my esteem <br>through 'Nafl'; till I choose him as 'My beloved'. I then <br>become his ear by which he listens, his eye by which <br>he looks, his hands by which he holds, and his feet by <br>which he walks (i.e. his listening, looking, holding and <br>walking are all in perfect accord with My injunctions, <br>and he would never even dream of employing any part <br>of his body in any action contrary to My commands). If <br>such a person prays for anything, I grant it to him and <br>if he seeks My protection I do protect him.\" <br>Those people are really blessed who, after performing <br>their Fardh, are in the habit of observing Nafl profusely. <br>May Allah give me and all my friends the strength to earn <br>this blessing. <br>2. \t<br>The Propet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spends the <br>whole night in Salaat: <br>A certain person asked A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Tell <br>me something noteworthy concerning the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br><br>84 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to <br>me these verses?' <br>'Lo! in the creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and in <br>the difference of night and day, are tokens (of His Sov- <br>ereignty) for men of understanding, such as remember <br>Allah. standing'sitting and reclining . . . (111:190-191)' \" <br>It has been reported in many Ahadith that the Pro- <br>phet's feet would get swollen because of his very long ra- <br>kaats in Salaat; people tried to reason with him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are sinless and still you <br>labour so hard!\" <br>He would reply: \"Should I not be a grateful slave of my <br>Allah, then?\" <br>3. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recitation <br>of the Qur'an in Salaat: <br>Hadhrat 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>85 sa <br>2 2  <br>\"I was once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). He brushed his teeth with a Miswak, performed <br>.g 4<br>s w<br>his Wudhu and stood up for Salaat. I also availed of * <br>the opportunity to join him. He recited surah 'Baqarah' <br>in his first rakaat; he would pray for mercy when he re- <br>cited any verse extolling the Grace of Allah, and would <br>supplicate for Divine forgiveness when reciting any <br>verse referring to His wrath. He took as much time in <br>Ruku' and Sajdah each as he had taken in Qiyaam. In <br>Ruku' he recited: <br>'Glory to Allah the Lord of Majesty, sovereignty and <br>magnificence.' <br>He recited the next three successive Soorahs in the re- <br>maining three rakaats, and each rakaat was of about the <br>same length as the first one.\" <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) has also narrated a <br>similar story about his Salaat with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam.) <br>The Qiraat (recitation) of the Qur'an by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the above mentioned four <br>rakaats amounts to more than one-fifth of he whole Qur'an. <br>And the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited the <br>Qur'an with proper intonation (Tajweed), and would also <br>pray and seek forgiveness after relevant verses. Again his <br>Ruku' and Sajdah also would last as long as his Qiyaarn. <br>We can thus have a fair idea of how much time he must <br>have taken to say his Salaat. This can only be possible <br>when Salaat is a source of great inner satisfaction and spiri- <br>tual ecstasy. That is why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) has often been quoted as saving: <br>\"The comfort of mv eyes lies in Salaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>Salaat of a Few Eminent Sahabah: <br>Hadhrat Mujahid (Radhiyallaho anho), describing the <br>Salaat of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), and that <br>of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"They stood in Salaat motionless like pieces of wood <br>stuck in the ground.\" <br>'Ulama agree that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyai- <br>laho anho) learnt to say his Salaat from Hadhrat Abu Hakr <br><br>86 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! The child's life was in <br>danger, and you took least notice of it.\" <br>His answer Mas: <br>\"Had I turned my attention to anything else, what <br>would have remained of the Salaat?\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was stabbed at the <br>close of his career, and this same wound caused his death. <br>He bled profusely and remained unconscious for long in- <br>tervals. But when hewas informed of the time of Salaat, he <br>would perform it in that very condition, and say: <br>\"There is no portion in Islam for the person who dis- <br>cards Salaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) would remain in <br>Salaat all night long, finishing the whole of the Qur'an in <br>one rakaat. <br>It is reported about Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that he would turn pale and tremble at the time of Salaat. <br>Somebody asked him the reason, and he said: <br>\"It is the time to discharge that trust which Allah of- <br>fered to the Heavens and the Earth and the hills, but <br>they shrank from bearing it, and I have assumed it.\" <br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>Somebody asked Khalaf-bin-Ayub: <br>\"Do not the flies annoy you in your Salaat?\" <br>His answer was: <br>\"Even the sinful persons patiently bear the lashes of <br>the government, to boast of their endurance afterwards. <br>Why should I be made to skip about by mere flies <br>when standing in the presence of my Lord?\" <br>Muslim bin Yasaar when he stood up for Salaat, said to <br>members of his family: <br>\"You may keep on talking, I shall not be knowing what <br>you talk.\" <br>Once he was saying his Salaat in the Jaami' musjid of <br>Basrah. A portion of the musjid wall fell down with a <br>crash; and eveFy body ran pel1 me11 for safety, but he never <br>even heard the noise. <br>Somebody asked Haatim Asam as to how did he say <br>his Salaat. <br>He replied: <br>\"When the time for Salaat comes, I perform my Wudhu <br>and go to the place where I have to say my Salaat. I sit <br>down for some time, till all the parts of my body are re- <br>laxed. Then I stand up for Salaat, visualising the <br>Ka'bah in front of me, imagining my feet upon the <br>Bridge of Siraat, with Paradise to my right, and Hell to <br>my left, and Izraa-eel close behind me, and thinking <br>that it may be my last Salaat. Then I say my Salaat <br>with full sincerity and devotion. And I finish my <br>Salaat between fear and hope about its acceptance. <br>5. <br>Salaat of a Muhajir and an Ansari keeping watch: <br>While returning from a campaign, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) happened to halt for the night at <br>some place. He inquired: <br>\"Who would keep watch over the camp this night?\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar bin Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) of the Mu- <br>hajirin and Hadhrat Abbaad bin Bishr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>of the Ansar offered their services. Both of them were <br>posted to watch from a hill-top against any possible night <br>attack by the enemy. <br><br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) said to Ammar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Let us keep watch and sleep turn by turn. In the first <br>half of the night I shall keep awake, while you go to <br>sleep. In the next half. you may keep watch while I go <br>to sleep.\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) agreed and went <br>to sleep, and Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) started <br>his Salaat. But an enemy scout made him out in the dark <br>from a distance. and let flv an arrow at him. Seeing that he <br>made no movernent, he shot another and still another <br>arrow at him. Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) drew <br>out arid threw away each arrow as it struck him, and at last <br>awakened his conlpanion. The enemy fled when he saw <br>them both together. fearing that there might be many more <br>of them. Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) rioticed <br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) bleeding from three places. He <br>said: <br>\"Subhanallah! whv did you not awake me earlier?\" <br>Abbaad replied: <br>\"I had started.reciting Surah 'Kahf' in my Salaat. I did <br>not like to cut it short. but when I was struck by the <br>third arrow. ,I was greatly concerned that my death <br>might jeopardise the safety of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I therefore finished the Salaat and <br>awakened you. But for this fear. I would not have gone <br>to Ruku' before finishing the Surah even if I had been <br>killed.\" <br>I <br>Look at the devotion of'the Sahaba to Salaat. One <br>arrow after another is piercing Hadhrat Abbaad's (Rad-<br>hiyallaho anho) body and he is bleeding profusely, but is <br>not prepared to sacrifice the pleasure of reciting the Qur'an <br>in his Salaat. On the other hand, the bite of a wasp, nay of a <br>mosquito, is sufficient to distract us from our Salaat. <br>According to the Hanafiyvah school of jurisprudence, <br>Wudhu breaks with bleeding, while according to the Sha- <br>fi'iyyah it does not. lt is just possible that Abbaad might be <br>having the latter view. or that this point might not have <br>been brought to an issue till then. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrht Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>m<br>Salaat: \t<br>.-<br>,om <br>V1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) was once <br>saying his Salaat in his garden. His attention was drawn to- <br>wards a bird that flitted about, but could not find a way out <br>of the dense foliage. For a short moment, he followed the <br>bird with his eyes, and forgot the number of his rakaat. <br>Upon this mishap, his sorrow knew no bounds. He re-<br>paired to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pres- <br>ence straightway and submitted thus: <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah, this garden of mine has been the <br>cause of a diversion in my Salaat. I give it away in the <br>cause of Allah. Kindly spend it as may appear proper <br>to you.\" <br>A similarchance befell one of the Ansaar in the time of <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). He was saving his <br>Salaat in his garden. The branches of the trees were <br>weighed down with ripe juicy dates, luxurious abundance, <br>which caught his eyes, and he felt pleased with it. This <br>made him forget the number of his rakaat. He was so much <br>stricken with grief that he decided to part with the garden <br>that had distracted him from his Salaat. He approached <br>Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) and made over the garden to <br>him for utilising it in the path of Allah. LJsman (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) had the garden sold for fifty thousand dirhams <br>and spent the money as desired. This shows the value the <br>Sahaba set on their faith; and Hadhrat Abu Talha (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) could give away his orchard worth fifty <br>thousand dirhams because it had interfered with his Salaat. <br>According to Shah Waliullah, the Sufis give preference to <br>obedience to Allah over anything that distracts from it. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eye. A doctor told him: <br>\"A treatment is possible, provided you are willing to <br>take precautions. For five davs, it will be essential for <br>you to avoid prostrating yourself on the ground. You <br>can, however, use a wooden desk for performing <br>Sajdah.\" <br><br>90 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once <br>visited the market. He noticed that at the time of Salaat, <br>everybody closed his shop and flocked to the musjid. He <br>remarked: <br>\"These are people about whom Allah has remarked: <br>\"Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when <br>hearts and eyeballs will be overturned. <br>(XXIV: 3 7)\" <br>i <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"These people were completely absorbed in their <br>trade, but when they heard Azaan they left everything <br>1<br>and hastened towards the musjid.\" \t<br>I <br>He once remarked: \"By Allah, they were such traders <br>whose trade did not hinder them from the remembrance of <br>I <br>Allah.\" <br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>91 SJZ <br>L. -<br>\"9 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>once chanced to be in the market when Azaan was called <br>3,<br>m<br>out. He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning. Again it <br>will be asked, 'who are those who kept away from their <br>beds and passed their nights in worshipping their Cre- <br>ator.' Another group will arise and enter Paradise with- <br>out any reckoning. The angel will ask yet again, 'where <br>are those whom trade did not hinder from remember- <br>ing Allah.' And yet another group will arise and enter <br>Paradise without any reckoning. After these three <br>groups have departed, and reckoning would com-<br>mence for the people in general.\" <br>9. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Khubaib, Hadhrat Zaid and <br>Hadhrat 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anhum): <br>The Qureysh writhed with fury and rage at the loss of <br>some of their greatest men in Uhud. Sulaifah, whose two <br>sons had fallen in action, had taken a solemn vow that she <br>would drink wine in the skull of 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>who had killed both of them, if she could get possession of <br>his head. She had proclaimed a prize of one hundred <br>camels (a stupendous sum for the place and the time) for <br>the person who brought 'Asim's head to her. Sufyan bin <br>Khalid worked out a plan to secure the prize. He sent a few <br>men of Adhal Waqarah to Madinah, who pretended to em: <br>brace Islam: they besought the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) to detail some persons to accompany them to <br>their locality to preach Islam to the populace. They made a <br>special request for 'Asim (Kadhiyallaho anho) saying: <br><br>92 <br>93 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Our people will very much appreciate his mode of <br>address.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed ten (or <br>six according to another report) of his companions to go <br>with them, and 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) was of course in- <br>cluded in these. They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations. Allah, <br>the most beloved, is with you, and your celestial <br>spouses are this minute waiting for you.\" <br>With these words, he rushed into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and when his spear broke he fought on with his <br>sword. Thus he fell fighting to the last. His last prayer was: <br>\"0,Allah! inform the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) about our fate.\" <br>Allah, in His compassion, answered his prayer by revealing <br>the news to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). As <br>'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) had come to know about Sula- <br>fah's vow to drink wine in his skull, he also prayed: <br>\"0,Allah! I have laid down my life in Thy cause: 0, <br>Allah, do save my head from the sacriligeous hands of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>This prayer was also granted. After his death, a swarm of <br>bees (or wasps according to another report) settled upon <br>his body, and foiled all attempts of the enemy to sever his <br>head. They left the body alone, intending to do their.dirty <br>job during the night, when the bees would have gone. But <br>during the night, there was a cloud-burst, which washed <br>the body away. <br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise. I would rather join my martyred brothers than go <br>alive with you.\" <br>He then refused to follow them in captivity. They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then. The two re- <br>maining captives were taken by them to Mecca and sold to <br>the Qureysh. Safwan bin Umayyah paid fifty camels for <br>Zaid bin Wathna (Kadhiyallaho anho] to kill him in re- <br>venge for the death of his father Umayyah in 'Uhud', and <br>Hujair bin Abi Ahaab bought Khubaib (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>for one hundred camels to avenge the fall of his father in <br>the same battle. <br>Safwan made over Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>to his slave to be killed outside the limits of the Haram. A <br>crowd followed them to watch Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anhp) meet his end, and Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also happened to be one of the spectators. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) stood prepared to meet his doom, Abu <br>Sufyan asked him thus: <br>I <br>\"Don't yo11 \\I ,11 hluhalnmad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to be in vour place today, and you be let off to <br>enjoy life with your family?\" <br>Zaid's (Kadhivallaho anho) replv amazed them all: <br>\"Hv Allah!\" he said. \"the trerv tho~~ght <br>of enjoying life <br>with nlv family is unbearable to me. if the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were even to suffer a <br>thorn-prick in his foot for that.\" <br><br>94 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Qureysh simply could not understand this reply, and <br>Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"There is absolutely no parallel, anywhere in the <br>world, to the love that the companions of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bear him.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was then martyred. <br>Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the <br>captivity of Hujair for a long time. A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing <br>the child with the razor. But to remove their fears on <br>observing their alarm, Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhoj remarked: 'Do you think that I would stoop to <br>the killing of an innocent child? This heinous crime is <br>simply not possible for me.'\" <br>When he was brought to the gallows, and asked to <br>make his last wish, if any, he requested: <br>\"Allow me to say two rakaat of Salaat, for it is time for <br>me to leave the'world and meet my Allah.\" <br>They let him say his Salaat. On finishing the two rakaat <br>most calmly, he said: <br>\"But for your thinking that I was afraid of death, I <br>would have said another two rakaats.\" <br>He was then tied to the gallows. At that time he said: <br>\"0,Allah! There is nobodv to convey my last Salaam <br>to Thy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>And Allah sent his Salaam to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through an angel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) answered: <br>\"Wa alaikumus salaam! 0 Khubaib.\" <br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>3 I11<br>and observed to the Sahabah: \t<br>'C C, <br>\"Khubaib has been martyred by the Qureysh.\" <br>m <br>S m  <br>At the gallows, forty of the Querysh speared him simul- <br>taneously. One of those teased him: <br>Say by Allah, if you now wish Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) to be in your place and you to be let <br>off.\" <br>He replied: \t \"By Allah the Most Magnificent. I will not tol- <br>erate a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in ransom for my life.\" <br>Every word of this story is a lesson for us all. The de- <br>votion and love of the Sahabah narrated therein is really <br>something to esteem and covet. They would lay down their <br>very lives, but they would not tolerate even a thorn piick- <br>ing the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Again, look at <br>Hadhrat Khubaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) last wish. He <br>neither remembers his family members nor wishes to see <br>any of them; what he wishes is to send his last Salaam to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and to say two last <br>rakaats of Salaat. <br>10. Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) company in <br>Paradise: <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"1 used to remain in attendance upon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) at night. I would keep water, <br>miswak, praying mat, etc., ready for his Tahajjud. Once <br>he (being very pleased with my services) asked me, <br>'What would you wish most?' I submitted, '0,Prophet <br>of Allah. I wish your company in Paradise.' He asked <br>me if there was anything else I wished for. But I re-<br>plied. 'This is the only thing I long for.' Upon this, he <br>remarked. 'All right. You should help me by prostrat- <br>ing in prayer frequently.' \" <br>Here is a lesson for us. We should not depend on <br>verbal prayers alone, but we should also make some practi- <br>cal efforts to gain our object. The best of all efforts is Salaat. <br>Also, it would be wrong to depend entirely on the prayers <br>of saints and pious people alone. This is a world of cause <br>and effect: and, no doubt, Allah sometimes in His Wisdom <br>and Might does bring into effect things for which there is <br><br>96 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>7 <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too). <br>CHAPTER VI <br>SYMPATHY AND SELF-SACRIFICE <br>The Sahabah, as a class, were an embodiment of right- <br>eousness. They attained a standard that is rather difficult to <br>emulate in a modern society. We would be fortunate if we <br>really attain even a partial resemblance to their character. <br>Some of their qualities are peculiarly their own, and self- <br>sacrifice is one of these. Allah has made a mention of this <br>in the Holv Qur'an in these'words. <br>\"They prkfer others above themselves. even though <br>poverty become their lot. (LIX: 9).\" <br>1. Feeding the guest in darkness: <br>A Sahabi came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and complained of hunger and distress. Just then, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had nothing in hand, <br>or in his home to feed him. He asked the Sahabah: <br>\"Would anybody entertain him as a guest tonight on <br>my behalf?\" <br>One of the Ansaar said: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah, I will do that.\" <br>The Ansari took the person to his house and instructed his <br>wife: <br>\"Look here, this man is a guest of the Prophet [Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We will entertain him as best as <br>we can, and won't spare anything in doing so.\" <br>The wife replied: <br>\"By Allah! I have got no food in the house, except a <br>verv little-something just enough for the children.\" <br>The Ansari said: <br>\"You lull the children to sleep without feeding them, <br>while I sit with the guest over the meagre meal. When <br>we start eating, put out the lamp pretending to set it <br><br>98 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight. When we sit at the meal, <br>put out the lamp, pretending to set it right, and you are <br>not to eat anything until the guest has taken his fill.\" <br>The scheme worked out as in the last story. The husband <br>and wife sat with the guest and the simple soul never sus- <br>pected in the least that neither of them had partaken at all <br>of the food, though their hands and jaws seemed to be <br>moving all right. When Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) repaired to tbe Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) presence next morning, he was greeted with the <br>happy news; <br>\"0,Thabit! Allah has very much appreciated your en- <br>tertainment of the guest last night.\" <br>3. <br>Overpaymentof Zakaat: <br>Hadhrat Ubay bin Kaab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once dep- <br>uted me to collect Zakaat dues from a locality. I went <br>to a person there, and asked about the details of his <br>possessions. A baby camel one year old was due from <br>him in Zakaat. When he heard this, he exclaimed, 'Of <br>what use is a baby camel, one year old? You can <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>99 <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she-camel in-stead; which he refused to accept <br>without your permission. I have now come to you with <br>the she-camel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) observed, 'No doubt only that much is due from <br>you which he has worked out, but if you are willing to <br>give more than that, of your own accord, it would be <br>accepted.' I then presented the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which he accord- <br>ingly accepted and sought Allah's blessings for the <br>donor.\" <br>Look, with what magnanimity of heart the Sahabah <br>parted with their best things for the sake of Allah. On the <br>other hand, we too claim to be the true followers of Islam, <br>and ardent devotees of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) but, leaving apart the bestowing of alms in general <br>to the poor and the needy, we are most reluctant to pay the <br>actual obligatory dues. Zakaat, as a pillar of Islam, is not <br>even known to our upper classes. Of the middle classes, <br>only the religiously conscious strata keep up a form of <br>paying Zakaat, in as much as even the expenditure in- <br>curred on their own relatives and acquaintances, and all <br>other charitable donations squeezed out of them by the <br>force of circumstances and face-savings are debited to this <br>account. <br><br></p></div>"

In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam): <br>'How mu~h'?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Exactly one-half.' <br>By and by, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>along with his load. It transpired that he had brought <br>everything that he possessed. <br>This is what I heard: ' <br>The Prophet (Sa/lallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'What did you leave for your family, Abu Bakr?' <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'I have left Allah and his Prophet for them.' <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that on that day <br>he admitted to himself that he could never hope to surpass <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Allah says in his Holy Book. <br>\"Vie one with another in good works (V:48).\" <br>Such healthy emulation in sacrifice is therefore quite <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>101 \t & <br>b a<br>0s <br>desirable and welcome. This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well.

Hadhrat Hamzah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) fell in Uhud, and the ruthless enemy bru- <br>tally cut off his nose, ears and vitals. He was ripped open, <br><br>102 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it, she simply exclaimed, <br>'Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon' and offered a prayer <br>for his soul.\" <br>In another Hadith, Hadhrat ZuLair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself narrates the incident. He says: <br>\"We rnade out a woman drawing near the place where <br>the martyrs of Uhud had been gathered. On her close <br>approach, I recognised her to be my own mother. I ad-<br>vanced to stop her, but she proved to be too strong for <br>me. She thrust me aside, with the words, 'Leave me <br>alone.' Whgn I told her that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had prohibited her from seeing the <br>dead body, she at once desisted from her purpose and <br>explained. \"Hearing the news of my brother's death, I <br>have brought a couple of sheets for his shroud. Take <br>these sheets and make use of them.' We took the sheets <br>and had begun to enshroud the body, when the dead <br>body of an Ansari named Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) caught our eyes. It was also lying close by <br>1 <br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>103 <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of <br>sympathy, equality and self-sacrifice? Is it not shameful on <br>our part that we, who call ourselves the followers of these <br>illustrious people, do not possess any of these qualities. <br>7. <br>The Story of the Goat's Head: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"One of the Sahabah received a goat's head as a pres- <br>ent. He thought of a neighbour who had a larger family <br>and was in greater need of it thar, himself, and pre- <br>sented the same to him.

In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam): <br>'How mu~h'?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Exactly one-half.' <br>By and by, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>along with his load. It transpired that he had brought <br>everything that he possessed. <br>This is what I heard: ' <br>The Prophet (Sa/lallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'What did you leave for your family, Abu Bakr?' <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'I have left Allah and his Prophet for them.' <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that on that day <br>he admitted to himself that he could never hope to surpass <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Allah says in his Holy Book. <br>\"Vie one with another in good works (V:48).\" <br>Such healthy emulation in sacrifice is therefore quite <br>Ch.

This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well.

During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place.

Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with <br>cooking something which those people could eat. After <br>some time, Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>called out from inside the tent, <br>\"Amir-ul-Mominin, congratulate your friend on the <br>birth of a son.\" <br>The person was much embarrassed when he heard the ad- <br>dress of 'Amir-ul-Mominin' and realized the position of the <br>person who had been serving him. But Hadhrat 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) put all his fears to rest, saying: <br>\"That is all right, there is nothing to worry about.\" <br>He then placed the pan near the tent, asking his wife to <br>take it and feed the woman. She fed her and returned the <br>pan. Then Hadhrat U'mar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked the <br>bedouin to partake of the food, as he had kept awake the <br>whole night. <br>Having rendered this service, Hadhrat U'mar (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) returned home with his wife, telling the person <br>\"Come to me tomorrow, and I shall see what I can do for <br>you.\" <br>Is there any king, nay a petty chief, or even an ordinary <br>middle class person of our time, who will thus take his <br><br>106 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse, <br>\"You will not attain unto piety until you spend of that <br>which Ye love (111: 92).\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) repaired to the <br>I<br>Prophet's presence and thus opened his heart, <br>1 <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I love Bir Ha very much. As <br>Allah wants us toppend precisely that which we love, <br>I make over that garden to be spent in the path of Allah <br>as you please.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was very much <br>pleased, and remarked: <br>1 <br>\"What a fine present (to Allah)! I think it would be <br>best utilized if you distribute it among your own <br>heirs.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and acted <br>upon the Prophet's advice. <br>1 <br>. <br>Are we prepared to part with any of our dear things for <br>l<br>the sake of Allah so quickly, after reading a verse of the <br>I <br>1<br>Qur'an or listening to a well-delivered sermon? <br>Ch.

Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) reprimands his <br>servant: <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) was well <br>known for his piety and abstinence. He kept no money <br>with him, and likewise did not like others to hosrd it. He <br>was always fighting against the moneyed class. Hadhrat <br>Usman, (Radhiyallaho anho), therefore, during his caliph- <br>ate advised him to shift to Rabzah (a small village in the <br>desert). He had a few camels to live on, and an old servant <br>to look after them. A tribesman from Banu Sulaim onca <br>presented himself with a request: <br>\"I wish to stay with you to benefit from your knowl- <br>edge of Allah's commandments and the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) ways and habits; I shall also <br>help your servant in looking after the camels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"I cannot keep with me a person who does not comply <br>with my wishes; but if you can always do as bidden, <br>you may remain with me, else I wish good-bye to you.\" <br>The person asked: <br>\"In what way do you like me to carry out your <br>wishes.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"When I ask you to spend from my belongings, you are <br>required to spend the best of them.\" <br>The person says, \"I accepted Hadhrat Abuzar's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) condition and stayed on with him. One <br>day, somebody informed him that there were some poor <br>folk camping near the spring close-by and were in dire <br>need of food. He asked me to fetch a camel. Accordingly, I <br>went and intended to select the best of the lot, as I had <br>pledged to do. It was a very fine and submissive animal <br>and good for riding. so I decided to let it be, and selected <br>the second best, as after all it was only to be slaughtered <br>and eaten and, for this purpose, just as good as the other. <br><br>108 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I: \t<br>'I did not forget you instructions, but thought it better <br>to preserve the one for transport duties, while the <br>other was as good for eating.' <br>Abuzar: 'Was it for my personal need that you left it?' <br>I: \t<br>'Yes.' <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Come, let me tell you the occasion of my needs. That <br>is the day when I shall be laid all alone in the solitude <br>of the grave. Remember, there are three partners in <br>your wealth, viz. (1)Your destiny, which does not wait <br>to take away its share. Good or bad it would take away <br>all that it has to take. (2) Your heirs, who are waiting <br>for the day of your death, so that they may take over <br>their share, and (3) Yourself. If you can manage, don't <br>be the most helpless of the three partners. Take your <br>full share, while you can. Allah says: <br>'Ye will not attain unto piety until you spend of tnat <br>. \t<br>which you love. (111: 92). I, therefore, think it advisable <br>to send in advance the things which I love best, so that <br>they may be in safe deposit for me there.' <br>u <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>109 2%<br>i <br>0% <br>I <br>That man is the worst loser of the three partners who $4 <br>does not spend his wealth in the path of Allah, and keeps <br>Sv! <br>postponing the event till at last destiny takes it away from <br>him, or Re dies and his heirs appropriate it. It is very <br>seldom that the heirs give away in the path of Allah the <br>wealth inherited from another person, so that his soul may <br>benefit by it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>remarked: <br>\"Man cherishes his worldly belongings, hugging them <br>to his soul, and gloating, 'my wealth, my wealth,' but <br>I <br>in reality only that much of it is his wealth, which he <br>either enjoys in the form of food or dress or spends in <br>the path of Allah to be stored up for him in the Here- <br>after. What is left of his wealth belongs to others; he is <br>only acting as a custodian.\" <br>In another Hadith, it is reported that once the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired of the Sahabah. <br>\"Which of you would rather like to see his wealth in <br>the hands of his heirs than keep it with himself?\" <br>I <br>I <br>They replied: \"Who would like to be such a person, 0<br>I <br>Prophet of Allah? (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)\" <br>I <br>I <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex-<br>plained: <br>\"Whatever you send in advance by spending it in the <br>path of Allah is yours, and whatever is left behind be- <br>longs to your heirs.\" <br>1 \t<br>11. The Story of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far and Hadhrat <br>.Abdullah Bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma): <br>Hadhrat Ja'far Tayyar (Radhiyallaho anho) is a cousin <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a brother of <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). His whole family is re- <br>i \t<br>nowned for magnanimity, generosity, valour and heroism, <br>but Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) had a special love <br>for the poor and often mingled and associated with them. <br>He emigrated to Abyssinia with the other Muslims at the <br>time of the persecution by Qureysh, and he was the spokes- <br>man who so successfully defended the emigrants in the <br>court of the Negus. This story we have already given in <br>Chapter I. After returning from Abyssinia, he emigrated to <br>Madinah and was martyred in the expedition of Mootah. <br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>110 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>111<br>8 <br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity <br>just then and this grieved him very much. Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) purchased the whole lot through <br>his agent, and distributed it (free) among the people. He <br>always acted as a host to all the strangers who were <br>stranded in the city during the night. <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), when participat- <br>ing in his last battle, called his son Hadhrat Abdullah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to his side and confided to him that he had <br>a premonition that this was going to be his last fight, in <br>which he was destiried to fall, adding that if it turned out <br>to be so, Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) was to <br>clear all his debts. He further admonished his son to call <br>upon his 'Master' if he encountered any difficulty in doing <br>so. His son, a bit puzzled, inquired as to who his Master <br>was? \"Allah,\" replied Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>The same day he met his fate. When Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) checked the accounts of his <br>father, he discovered debts that amounted to no less than <br>two million dirhams. Having the reputation of being as <br>honest and trustworthy a person as any that ever breathed, <br>people flocked to him for the safe deposit of their money. <br>He invariably address them like this: <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money <br>was due to Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) from his father. He therefore went to him again and <br>said: <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Excuse me. It was my mistake. In fact my father owed <br>you that much money.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If that is the case, I remit the debt.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"No, I must pay it.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You may pay it at your convenience.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Will you accept some land in lieu thereof? (He had re- <br>ceived some land as his share of booty. and he wanted <br>to dispose of it.\") <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yes, if it suits you.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). says, \"I <br>made over to him a piece of waterless land. He asked his <br><br>112 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>8 <br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual. <br>CHAPTER VII <br>VALOUR AND HEROISM <br>Fear of death was unknown to the Sahabah. They were <br>therefore most fearless and valorous. A person who can <br>look death in the face can meet all situations. There is left <br>for him no attraction in the wealth of this world, and no <br>fear of an enemy. I wish I could inherit this quality from <br>these true heroes. <br>1. \t Ibn Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) and Sa'd (Radhiyal- <br>laho d o )  Pray for Each Other: <br>On the eve'of Uhud, Abdullah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"0.Sa'd! come, let us pray together. Let each pray to <br>Allah for the grant of his sole desire, and the other <br>would say Ameen to it. This way, the praye:s are more <br>likely to be answered by Allah.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) agreed, and they both went to a <br>corner to pray. <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was first to pray, saying: <br>\"0,Allah, when the battle rages tomorrow, let me face <br>a very strong and fierce enemy. Let him attack me with <br>might and main, and let me repulse him with all my <br>strength. Then 0,Allah, let me be triumphant by kill- <br>ing him for your sake, and allow me to have his pos- <br>sessions as booty.\" <br>Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) said; \"Ameen .\" <br>Then Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anno) started his prayer, <br>saying: <br>\"0,Allah, let me face one of the toughest fighters <br>among the enemy tomorrow. Let him attack me with <br>full fury and let me attack him with my full strength. <br>Then let him have the upper hand and kill me. lie may <br>cut my nose and ears from my body. And when I <br>appear before You on the day of Judgement, You may <br>ask me, 'How did you lose your nose and ears, 0,Ab-<br><br></p></div>"

Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2. Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) valour in Uhud: <br>Neglect of the Prophet's orders changed the victory at <br>Uhud into a defeat, the details of which we have already <br>seen in Chapter I. That was a very hard time for the Mus- <br>lims. They were simply caught between the two groups of <br>the enemy, and many were killed. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was surrounded by the enemy, who <br>spread the rumour that he had died. Most of the Sahabah <br>lost their balance of mind at this rumour, and that was the <br>main cause of their c6nfusion. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were surrounded by the enemy, and I could not <br>see the Prophet (sallalaho alaihe wasallam). I first sea- <br>rched for him among the living and then among the <br>I <br>dead, but I could not find him. I said to myself, 'It is <br>impossible for him to fly from the battle-field. It seems <br>that Allah is angry with us due to our sins, and He has <br>lifted him up to the heavens. There is no way left for <br>me except to jump into the enemy lines and fight till I <br>am killed.' I therefore attacked the enemy, clearing <br>them with my sword till I caught sight of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); I was very happy and was <br>sure that Allah had been protecting him through His <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both.\" <br>Look at the valour of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He jumps into the enemy lines singlehanded, when he is <br>unable to find the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>This also shows his extreme love and devotion to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>3. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anhoj is martyred <br>When the battle of Uhud started, Hadhrat Hanzalah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had just been wedded and therefore <br>did not join the battle from the beginning. It is said that he <br>had just left the bed of his wife and had hardly started <br>taking his bath, when he heard somebody breaking the <br>news about the defeat. He postponed the bath and, with <br>sword in hand, rushed towards the battle-field. He jumped <br>into the enemy concentration, fighting and penetrating till <br>he was killed. Now the body of the person killed in the <br>path of Allah is not washed, unless a bath has been incum- <br>bent on him before his death. Not knowing his failure to <br>take the bath incumbent on him, the Sahabah buried him <br>without a wash. Just before his burial, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I see the angels washing Hanzalah's body.\" <br><br>116 <br>117 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>very much to join the battle. People said to him: <br>\"You ar excusable, as you are lame. You need not go <br>to the battle.\" <br>He replied: \t \"How sad! that my sons go to Paradise, and I <br>stay behind.\" <br>His wife also wanted him to fight and get martyred, so that <br>she might have the honour of being the widow of a martyr. <br>To exhort him, she said to him: <br>\"I do not believe that people have stopped you from <br>going. It seems that you are yourself afraid to go to the <br>battlefield.\" <br>Hearing this, Hadhrat 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) equipped <br>himself with arms and, facing Qiblah, prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>He then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said: <br>\"I had always wished for martyrdom, but my people <br>have always been stopping me from going into the <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud, <br>again and again. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was informed of this, he said: <br>\"The camel is charged to do that. Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br><br></p></div>"

Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>118 <br>119 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam. In the battle of <br>Uhud, Musab (Radhiyallaho anho) held the flag of Islam. <br>When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in <br>confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. <br>An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the <br>flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at <br>once took the flag in the other hand. The enemy then cut <br>the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with the <br>help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his <br>body with an arrow. He fell dead and, with him fell the flag <br>that he had not allowed to fall while he was alive. Another <br>Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, <br>he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too <br>short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the <br>feet would be exposed, and when it was drawn to cover the <br>feet, the head would become uncovered. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Cover his head with the sheet, and his feet with 'Azk-<br>har'leaves.\" <br>Such was the end of the youth who was brought up in <br>luxury and comfort. The person who used to wear a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams does not have sufficient cloth <br>to cover his dead body. Look! With what valour he tried to <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind <br>in Madinah. Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was very <br>brave and considered to be one of the heroes of Arabia. Iraq <br>was a part of the Persian Empire and Yazdjard was the Em- <br>peror at that time. He sent for one of his best generals <br>named Rustam and charged him with the task of checking <br>the Muslim advance. Rustam tried to avoid going to the <br>front, because of the fear of the Muslims, and requested the <br>Emperor again and again to keep him back, saying: <br>\"I shall make arrangements for the despatch of re-<br>inforcements and shall be of use to your Majesty at the <br>time of counsel.\" <br>But the Emperor did not agree, and he had to go to the <br>battlefield. <br>When Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>leave Madinah, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gave <br>him the following instructions: <br>\"0,Sa'd! Let this fact not beguile you that you are one <br>of the trusted companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and that people call you his uncle. <br>Allah does not repel evil with evil, but He repels evil <br>with good. Allah has no relation with His creation. All <br><br></p></div>"

One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\" <br>Ask the people who are addicted to liquor, how much <br>they love to taste it. The Sahabah loved to meet death in <br>the Path of Allah even more. This was the chief cause of <br>their success. <br>7. \t Hadhrat Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) was a shepherd <br>and had been a ~usl\"lm for some time. He lived in his vil- <br>lage in the desert. He came to Madinah to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was accompanied by his <br>nephew and his herd of goats, which he had tied with a <br>rope. He learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was in Uhud. He left his goats and went to Uhud to <br>fight by the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). A group of the enemy was at that time advancing to <br>attack the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet announced: <br>b <br>\"The person who disperses these people will be my <br>companion in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) attacked them fiercely <br>and repulsed all of them. A second and third group of the <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>121 2 3  <br>0s<br>I<br>enemy tried to advance, and each time it was Hadhrat <br>.gs<br>Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) who fought them and put them <br>$ g<br>m<br>to flight single handed. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) gave him good tidings of Paradise. No sooner did <br>he hear this, than he jumped into the enemy lines and <br>fought till he was no more. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I have never seen a person fighting so bravely and <br>fearlessly as Wahb did. I saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) standing beside his dead body, <br>saying, '0Wahb! You have pleased me. May Allah be <br>pleased with you.\" <br>Although the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself <br>was wounded in this battle, yet he buried Wahb's body <br>with his own hands. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to say: <br>\"I never envied anybody more than Wahb (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho). I wish I could appear before Allah with a <br>record as good as his.\" <br>What is it in the life of Hadhrat Wahb (Radhivallaho <br>anho) that makes an illustrious and exalted person like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to envy him. It is the <br>same spirit of sacrifice for the sake of Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even though Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and other Sahabah have better <br>deeds. <br>8. \t<br>Tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona. <br>In the tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona, seventy Sahabah were <br>massacred. All of them were Hafiz of Qur'an. Their Jama'at <br>was called the Jama'at of Qwaa and consisted mostly of <br>Ansaar. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) loved them <br>very much, for they engaged themselves in Zikr and recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an during the night, and attended upon the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his family during <br>the day. A person named Amir bin Malik and known as <br>Abu Bara, belonging to Bani Amir clan of Najd, came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took this Jama'at <br>with him for the Tabligh and the Ta'leem of his clan. The <br><br>122 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>? <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>123 <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better <br>than of three.\" <br>'Amir bin Tufail was the nephew of 'Amir bin Malik, who <br>had brought the Jama'at. He was a bitter enemy of Islam <br>and hated the Muslims to the core. When Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) delivered the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) epistle to him, he did not even care to <br>read it and attacked Hadhrat Haraam (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>with his spear, which pierced through the latter's body. <br>Hadhrat Haraam (RadHiyallaho anho) uttered \"By the Lord <br>of the Ka'bah, I have triumphed,\" and died. The heartless <br>person had no consideration for the guarantee given by his <br>uncle, nor for the accepted tradition all over the world, that <br>nobody would kill the envoy. He then assembled the <br>people of his clan and exhorted them to kill all the Saha- <br>bah camping at Bi'r Ma'oona. The people hesitated, in view <br>of the guarantee given by 'Amir bin Malik. He collected a <br>large number of people from the neighbouring tribes and <br>attacked the Muslims. They massacred each one of them, <br>except Hadhrat Ka'b bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>had some life left in him and the enemy left him as dead. <br>Hadhrat <br>Munzir <br>and <br>Hadhrat <br>Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), while grazing the camels, noticed vultures hover- <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made, 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) free and let him go. 'Amir bin Fuhairah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave of Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), was <br>also among those who were killed at Bi'r Ma'oona. Jabbar <br>bin Salmi, who killed him says: <br>When I thrust my spear through him, he uttered, 'By <br>Allah, I have triumphed and to my amazement I saw <br>his body lifted upwards towards the sky. I made enqui- <br>ries later on as to what was the triumph that 'Amir bin <br>Fuhairah (Radhiyallaho anho) meant when he uttered, <br>'By Allah, I have triumphed.' I was told that it was that <br>of entering into Paradise. This made me embrace <br>Islam. <br>These are the illustrious people, of whom Islam is <br>rightly proud. Death had really more attraction for them <br>than wine for their enemies. As they did deeds which were <br>sure to win Allah's pleasure, they felt most triumphant at <br>the time of surrendering their souls. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up Eating <br>Dates. <br>In Badr, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>sitting in a tent. He exhorted the Sahabah to fight, saying: <br><br></p></div>"

He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time. I <br>cannot do that.\" <br>Saying this, he threw away the dates, and with sword in <br>hand jumped into the battle-field and fought till he was <br>killed. <br>In fact, these people appreciated the value of Paradise, <br>for their Yaqeen was firm. If we too get that Yaqeen in our <br>hearts, nothing will be too difficult or too much for us. <br>10. \t Hadhrat 'Umar's IRadhiyallaho anho) Emigration to <br>Madinah. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) is well known for <br>his valour and heroism by one and all. When the Muslims <br>were very weak in the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) prayed to Allah to strengthen the Mus- <br>lims with Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Islam. This <br>prayer was answered by Allah in no time, as we have seen <br>in Chapter I. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma'sood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"We could not say our Salaat in the Haram till %mar <br>had accepted Islam.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was naturally very much upset when <br>the news reached him. He collected an army, 3 000-strong, <br>to advance against the enemy. While nominating Hadhrat <br>Zaid bin Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) to command the <br>army, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"If Zaid is killed, then Ja'far bin Abi Talib will be your <br>Amir and if he is also martyred, then Abdullah bin Ra- <br>wahah will take the command. If he also dies, then you <br>can select a commander from among yourselves.\" <br>A Jew, who was listening to this, said: <br>\"All the three must die. This is exactly how the earlier <br>Prophets used to prophesy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave Hadhrat <br>I \t<br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) a white flag made by himself. He <br>then accompanied the army for some distance out of Madi- <br>nah and prayed for them saying: <br>\"May Allah bring you back safely and triumphantly. <br>! <br>May He guard you against all evils.\" <br>At that moment, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was o poet too. recited three couplets. <br>I <br>i \t<br>which meant: <br><br>126 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred. We have never <br>fought by dint of our strength in arms and numbers. <br>We have always fought on the score of Islam, through <br>which Allah has exalted us. You are sure of one of the <br>two triumphs: Victory or Martyrdom.\" <br>Thus exhorted by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the Sahabah decided to advance till <br>they faced the Christian army in the battle-field of Moota. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with flag in his hand di- <br>rected the field operations. A fierce battle raged; Sharjeel's <br>brother was killed in action. Sharjeel himself fled from the <br>field and took shelter in a fort. He sent a message to the <br>Caesar, who immediately despatched for his help and an <br>army, which was 200 000-strong. The Muslims were fight- <br>ing against very heavy odds. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was killed and the flag was taken over by Hadhrat <br>Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho). He intentionally disabled his <br>horse to dispel any idea of returning home from the battle- <br>field. He then recited a few couplets, which meant: <br>\"0,people! What a beautiful place is Paradise. And <br>how happy is its approach! How fine and how cool is <br>its water. The Roman's doom is at hand, I must finish <br>them all.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>With flag in one hand and sword in the other, he jumped .$<br>into the enemy lines. The enemy cut his right hand, which 8~<br>held the flag. He at once transferred it to his left. When that <br>was cut off, he held the flag in his teeth and supported it <br>with his bleeding arms. His body was cut into two by <br>somebody from behind and fell dead. He was thirty-three at <br>that time. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When we removed him from the battle-field, we <br>counted as many as ninety wounds on his body--all <br>on the front side.\" <br>When Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was eating <br>a piece of meat in a corner of the battle-field. He had been <br>hungry for three days. On hearing about Hadhrat Ja'far's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) death, he threw away that piece of <br>meat, saying to himself: <br>\"Abdullah! You are busy in eating. while Ja'far has <br>reached Paradise.\" <br>He took the flag and began to fight. His finger was severely <br>injured and hung loose. He put the hanging finger under <br>his foot and tore it off from the hand, and then rushed for- <br>ward. Knowing the Muslims were fighting against very <br>overwhelming odds, and his own weakness, made him <br>pause for a moment. He at once recovered from his despair <br>and said to himself: <br>\"0, Heart! what makes you tarry now? Is it for the love <br>of wife? If so, then I divorce her this very moment. Is it <br>for the slaves? Then I set them all free. Is it for the <br>garden? I give it over in Sadaqah. He then recited a few <br>couplets, which meant: '0,Abdullah! You have to go <br>down after all; whether you do it willingly or unwil- <br>lingly. You have had enough of peace. 0,you, who are <br>only a drop of dirty fluid! See how the disbelievers are <br>assaulting the Muslims. Why does Paradise not entice <br>you? Even if you are not killed in this battle, remem- <br>ber, you have to die one day.\" <br>He then got down from his horse. Meanwhile his cousin <br>brought him a slice of meat, sayin \"You have had neither <br>sleep nor food for so many days. %at thiranrftake a little <br>rest before you fight.\" He held the slice and was about to <br><br>Ch. VII:, Valour and Heroism <br>128 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>9 <br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My name is Saeed (lit. auspicious).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your father's name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Jubair (lit. Trimmed).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"No, you are in fact Shaqi (lit. wretched) <br>son of Kusair (lit. a broken thing).\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My mother knew my name better than <br>you do.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"You are wretched and your mother is also <br>wretched.\" <br>0 <br>I<br>0<br>2w\\ \t<br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The Knower of the hidden things is <br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>Hajjaj: <br>-<br>someone else\" <br>\"Look! I am putting you to sword.\" <br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings, <br>never lagged behind in propagating the faith, yet we treat <br>them as the worst among rulers because of the contrast <br>with the just and God-fearing rulers. He was the viceroy of <br>king Abdul Malik bin Marwan for Hijaz and Iraq. The king <br>lived in Damascus and Hajjaj had his headquarters at <br>Koofah. Saeed bin Jubair had fought against Hajjaj on the <br>side of Ibnul Ash-ath. After the defeat. Saeed (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) ran away and took asylum in Mecca. The Govern- <br>ment posted a very stern person as the Governor of Mecca, <br>with instructions to'arrest Saeed. The Governor assembled <br>all the people of Mecca and read before them the order of <br>Abdul Malik, which said: <br>\"Any person who gives shelter to Hadhrat Saeed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) shall meet the same fate as Hadhrat <br>Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) himself.\" <br>He then announced to the people: <br>\"By Allah, I must kill the person who gives shelter to <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullah alaih). His and his neigh- <br>bours houses shall be razed to the ground.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was arrested with great <br>difficulty and sent to Koofah. When he was brought before <br>Hajjaj, the following conversation took place: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Then my mother was right in giving me <br>this name.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I shall send you to Hell.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"If I knew that you had that power. <br>would have taken you as my god.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"What is your belief about the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"He was an apostle of Mercy and a <br>Prophet of Allah, sent'with the best Guid- <br>ance for the whole creation.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What do you say about the Khalifas?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not a warder over them. Everybody <br>is responsiLle for his own actions.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Who is the most exalted of the four Khali- <br>. fahs?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The one who had been able to please <br>. Allah more than the rest.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Which of them had 'been able to please <br>Allah more than the rest?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"This is known only to Him Who knows <br>what is hidden in the bosoms and what <br>the hearts conceal.\" <br>I <br><br>130 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem- <br>peraments.\" <br>\"I am now going to kill you.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The time and mode of my death have <br>already been decreed.\" <br>~ a j j a j  <br>\"Allah has preferred me to you.\" <br>f <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Nobody can be proud of his relation with <br>Allfh, unless he knows his position; and <br>Allah is the only knower of the unseen.\" <br>\"Why should I not be proud of my relation <br>Hajjaj: <br>with Allah, when I am with the Amir-ul- <br>Mominin and you are with the rebels.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am with the other Muslims. I myself <br>shun mischief, but nobody can change the <br>decree of Allah.\" <br>\"What do y0.u say about what we collect <br>Hajjaj: <br>for Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do-not know what you collect for him.\" <br>Hajjaj sent for gold, silver and dresses fiom the trea- <br>sury and showed these to Saeed. <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>131 sc <br>%2 <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"These are useful, provided you are able to <br>obtain with them the things that may pro- <br>-84 <br>$,<br>vide you peace on the Day of Consterna- <br>tion (i.e Day of Judgement), when every <br>nursing mother will forget her nursing, <br>and every pregnant one will be delivered <br>of her burden, and when nothing but good <br>will be of any avail.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Are our collections not good?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"You have collected them, and you are the <br>best judge.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Do you like any of these things for your- <br>self?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I only like the things which Allah likes.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Woe to you!\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Woe is for the person who is deprived of <br>Paradise and is made to enter Hell.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>(Annoyed): \"Say how should I kill you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"As you would like to be killed.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Should I forgive you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah's forgiveness is real. Your aforgive- <br>ness is of no value.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>(To the executioner): \"Kill this man.\" <br>Hadhrat, Saeed laughed while he was being taken for <br>execution. Hajjaj was informed of this. He called him back. <br>\"What made you laugh?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Your boldness with Allah, and His,clem- <br>ency to you. \" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I am killing a person who has caused dis- <br>sent among the Muslims. (To the ex-<br>ecutioner) Kill him in front of me.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Let me say my Salaat of two rakaats.\" <br>After finishing Salaat, he faced Qiblah and recited: <br><br></p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br>0,<br>13 <br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br><br>14 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br><br></p></div>"

Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts. <br>\"Make him lie on his face. We are only re- <br>Hajjaj: <br>sponsible for appearance.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was made to lie on his <br>face. <br>Saeed: <br>\"Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return <br>you, and thqnce We bring you forth a second time.\" <br>(XX:55). <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Kill him\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: I call you to witness what I recite: <br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path. <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, who <br>is all alone and Who has no partner and I bear witness <br>that Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is His <br>slave and His Prophet.\" <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>CHAPTER-VIII <br>ZEAL FOR KNOWLEDGE <br>The Kalimah is the essence of Islam and the basis for <br>all achievements. No good action is acceptable with out <br>belief in Kalimah. The Sahabah, therefore, devoted most of <br>their energy, specially in the early days of Islam, to the <br>propagation of the Kalimah and to fighting with the forces <br>that resisted it. Although their engagements left them very <br>little time to drink deep from the ocean of learning with the <br>single-mindedness demanded thereof, yet their zeal even in <br>this direction has left us a legacy in the form of knowledge <br>about the Qur'an and Hadith, which is quite highly credita- <br>ble and a glaring example. When Sahabah go) a little lei- <br>sure from the work that kept them engtiged in the <br>beginning of Islam, and also when the number of people in <br>Islam grew considerably. Allah revealed the following <br>verse in the Qur'an: <br>\"And the believers should not all go out (in the path of <br>Allah). Of every group of them, a party only should go <br>forth that they (who are left behind) may gain sound <br>knowledge in feligion and that they may warn their <br>folk when they come to them, so that they may <br>beware.\" <br>(IX: 122). <br>Hadhrat ~bdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The verses of the Qur'an which were revealed in the <br>beginning of Islam, demanding every Muslim to move <br>out in the path of Allah; for example: <br>\"If you go not forth, He will afflict you with a painful <br>doom; <br>(IX:39)\" <br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>'Go forth, light and heavily armed, and strive with f 3  <br>your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah; <br>s m  <br>m<br>(IX:41).' <br>These verses were later on superceded by the foregoing <br>verse, which advised only a party from each group to leave <br>their places. <br>The Sahabah, very few in number as they were, had to <br>assume the responsibilities of Islam in all fields. Allah <br>therefore endowed them with the versatility that was <br>theirs. After the Sahabah, the Islam spread far and wide <br>and the Mu~lims swelled in number. Again, the later <br>people lacked the versatility of the Sahabah. Allah then <br>caused different people to specialize in different branches <br>of Islamic learning. Mohaddit.hin were to devote them- <br>selves to the collection and propagation of Hadith. Simi- <br>larly the Fuqaha (jurists) Soofia (Experts in Zikr), Qurraa <br>(Experts in recitation of Qur'an), Mujahidin (Fighters in the <br>path of Allah), etc, each own group had its own field to <br>take up as a whole-time task. This was very necessary at <br>that time, for otherwise different branches of Islamic learn- <br>ing would not have developed so nicely, as it is difficult for <br>one man to specialize in all the branches. The Prophets <br>(alaihimus salaam), and specially Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) the chief among them, were specially en- <br>dowed with such a capacity. This will explain why the <br>stories of other eminent personalities, besides the Sahabah <br>have also been narrated in this chapter. <br>1. Sahabah's Panel for Fatwa. <br>Although all the Sahabah, along with their engagement <br>in Jihad and propagation of faith, were devoted to acquir- <br>ing and further spreading of knowledge, yet there was a <br>panel of Sahabah who were exclusively entrusted with <br>Fatwa, even during the life tirne of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The panel comprised the following Saha- <br>bah:-<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr, Hadhrat 'Umar, Hadhrat Usman, <br>Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf. Hadhrat <br><br>136 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>IJbayy bin Kaab, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Hadhrat <br>Ma'aaz bin Jabal, Hadhrat Ammaar bin Yaasir, Hadhrat Hu- <br>zaifah, Hadhrat Salman Farsi, Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit, <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum). <br>To give Fatwa during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) was a big privilege for these Saha- <br>bah, and speaks of their deep and dependable knowledge. <br>2. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) burns his col- <br>lections: <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"My father (Hadhrat Abu Bakr) (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had a collection of five hundred Hadiths. One night I <br>noticed that he was very restless. He was tossing about <br>in the bed and could not sleep. I got worried over this <br>and inquired, 'Are you suffering from any trouble or <br>worried about anything.' But he did not speak and re- <br>mained restless throughout the night. Next morning he <br>called me and said, 'Bring the collection of Hadith that <br>I gave you to keep.' I brought the book and he set fire <br>to it, till it was burnt. He said, 'The collection con- <br>tained many Hadiths that I had heard from other <br>people. I thought if I died and left behind a Hadith ac- <br>cepted as authentic by me, but really not so, then I <br>should have to answer for that.\" <br>It was Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (Radhiyallaho anho) zeal for <br>knowledge, that cau2ed him to compile a book of five hun- <br>dred Hadiths. But it was due to his extreme cautiousness <br>that he burnt the collection. <br>The Sahabah were very careful and cautious about <br>Hadith. That is why you find very few Hadiths narrated by <br>eminent Sahabah; those people who do riot hesitate to <br>quote Hadith (without authority) in their sermons from the <br>pulpit should take a lesson from this story. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the Prophet's com- <br>pany for most of his time; many Sahabah say: <br>L <br>Hadhrat \"Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was the most <br>learned amongst us;\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>137 4,<br>~r * <br>0 s  <br>\"After the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>.K8 54 <br>Q*<br>sallam), when the Khalifah's selection was under con- <br>sideration, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) * <br>addressed the people quoting all those verses of the <br>Qur'an and all such Hadiths of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) which dealt with the virtues and <br>privileges of the Ansar.\" <br>This shows how much knowledge of the Qu'ran he had, <br>and how many Hadiths he remembered. In spite of all this, <br>there are very few Ahadith that have been narrated by <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). For similar <br>reasons, Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) too was <br>not so liberal in reporting Hadith. <br>3. \t Hadhrat Mu'sab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) Car- <br>ries out Tabligh. <br>A story about Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has already been given in Chapter VII. When the <br>first group of people from Madinah embraced Islam in <br>Mina, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) to go with <br>them to teach Islam and preach to others. He remained <br>busy all the time in teaching the Qur'an and other Islamic <br>practices to the people. He stayed with Hadhrat As'ad bin <br>Zararah (Radhiyallaho anho) and was known as 'Muqree' <br>(the teacher). <br>Sa'd bin Ma'az and Usaid bin Hudhairiyah, who were <br>among the chiefs of Madinah, did not like Mus'ab's activi- <br>ties. Sa'd said to Usaid: <br>You go to As'ad and tell that we do not like his having <br>brought a stranger with him to Madinah, who misleads <br>the poor and simple folk of the town.\" <br>Usaid went to Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho anho) and <br>talked to him very harshly. Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to him: <br>\"You first listen to him; if you like his teachings, you <br>may accept them; if not, you have every right to de- <br>nounce and stop him.\" <br>Usaid agreed to it. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) ex- <br>plained the virtues of Islam and recited a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before him. Usaid said: <br><br>138 <br>139 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"These teachings are very fine and these verses are <br>simply beautiful. How do you admit a person to your <br>faith?\" <br>He said: \t \"You take a bath, put on clean clothes and recite <br>the Kalimah.\" <br>Usaid immediately complied with all these formalities and <br>embraced Islam. He then went to Sa'd and brought him to <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) to listen to his Tabligh. Sa'd <br>also embraced Islam. No sooner had Sa'd accepted Islam <br>than he went to people of his clan (Banu Ash-hal) and said <br>to them: <br>\"What type of person do you think I am?\" <br>They replied: \"You are the best and the noblest of <br>clan.\" <br>the <br>He then said: \"I have vowed not to talk to your men and <br>women until you all embrace Islam and be- <br>lieve in Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe was- <br>sallam).\" <br>All the men and women of Banu Ash-ha1 embraced Islam <br>then and there. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>to teach them and train them in Islam. <br>No sooner did anybody embrace Islam than he began <br>to preach it. Everyone of them considered it incumbent <br>upon him to preach and teach to others what he know <br>about Islam. His trade, farm or occupation was no barrier to <br>Tabligh. <br>4. \t Hadhrat 'Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is one <br>of the most eminent Sahabah and was an expert in the reci- <br>tation of the Qur'an. Very few Arabs were literate before <br>Islam, and he was one of these. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) used to dictate the revealed Qur'an to <br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>He used \t to finish the Qur'an once in Tahajjud in eight <br>nights. Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassalam) said <br>to him: <br>\"Allah has commanded me to recite the Qur'an to <br>you.\" <br>He said: \t \"0, Prophet of Allah! Did Allah mention me by <br>my name?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Yes, He mentioned you by your name.\" <br>Tears began to roll down his cheeks with excessive joy. <br>Hadhrat Jundub bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When I went to Madinah to acquire knowledge, I <br>found that people were sitting in groups, and each <br>group wag entrusted to a teacher. In one of the groups I <br>saw a person teaching Hadith, clad in two sheets of <br>cloth and looking like a traveller. I asked the people, <br>'Who is this person?' They said, 'He is our esteemed <br>Imam, Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho).' <br>When he finished teaching, I followed him to his <br>house. He was staying in a very old and dilapidated <br>building, with little or no furniture. I noticed Hadhrat <br>Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) living in a very simple and <br>ascetic life.' <br>Hadhrat Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Once the Prohet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) tested <br>me in my knowledge of the Qur'an. He asked me, <br>'Ubayy, which is the most august verse of the Qur'an?' <br>I said, 'Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) know best.' He again asked my the same question <br>and I gave the same modest and respectful reply. When <br>he put the same question once again, I replied, 'The <br>most august verse in the Qur'an is Ayatul Kursi (11: <br>255).' My reply made him very happy. He said, 'May <br>-<br>Allah bless you through your knowledge.' <br>him. He memorised the Qur'an during the life time of the <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was leading <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and had thorough <br>. \t<br>Salaat when he missed one verse. Ubayy (Radhiyallaho <br>understanding of it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>anho) pointed out the correction from behind. On finishing <br>lam) is reported to have said: <br>Salaat, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired <br>\"Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is the <br>'Who corrected me?' He was told that it was Hadhrat Ubayy <br>greatest Qari of my Ummat.\" <br><br>141 <br>140 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>F <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He remarked, 'I also thought that it <br>was he.\" <br>In spite of his devotion to knowledge and his special <br>job of writing the Qur'an, he took part in all the battles by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He did <br>not miss a single campaign or expedition led by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Huzaifah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Anxiety Re- <br>garding Tribulations. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the <br>well-known Sahabah. He is known as 'Keeper of Secrets.' <br>The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) had confided to <br>him the names of Munafiqin, and had informed him in <br>1<br>chronological order all the tribulations which the Muslims <br>were to face till the last day. He gave him full details (viz. <br>the name of the mischief maker, his parents' names, his <br>community, etc.) about the incidents that were going to <br>affect three hundred or more people. Hadhrat Huzaifah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Other people used to -ask the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about good things, while I always <br>asked him about the adverse events, so that I might <br>guard against them.\" <br>He then narrated the following conversation with the <br>Prophet: <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Shall we revert to <br>evil, after the good that you have brought <br>us?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes. The evil is coming.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"Shall we have good again after that evil?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"Huzaiiah! Go and read the Qur'an, medi- <br>tate on its meaning and follow its com-<br>mandments.\" <br>But Huzaifah anxiety grew more and more, and he con- <br>tinued his queries about evils that were to befall the ,Mus- <br>lims. <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Tell me if good will <br>come after that evil?\" <br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>TheProphet: \t \"Yes, good will come again, but the hearts <br>of the people will not be so clear as before.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"And will there by any evil coming after <br>this good?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes, There will be such persons who will <br>misguide the people and take them to Hell.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"What should I do if I witness that time?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"If there be a group of Muslims united <br>under one Amir, then join them, otherwise <br>dissociate yourself from all such factions <br>and be secluded in a corner, or take refuge <br>under a tree (i.e., in the forest) and be there <br>till you die.\" <br>As the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had dis- <br>closed to him the identities of the Munafiqin of that time, <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to ask him: <br>\"Is there any Munafiq among my deputies?\" <br>Heonce replied: \t \"Yes. There is one, but I shall not dis- <br>close his name.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) dismissed the man, <br>probably by his own discernment. <br>Whenever somebody died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) would inquire if Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was participating in the funeral prayer. If <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) did not do so, then Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) would also absent himself from <br>that funeral: <br>'when Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he wept in anxiety and uneasiness. People <br>said to him:- <br>\"Are you weeping over your departure <br>from this world?\" <br>He said: <br>\"No. I am not weeping over that. I love to <br>die. I weep because 1 do not know <br>whether, at this time of my departure <br>from this world. Allah is pleased with <br>me or not .\" <br>He then prayed: \"0,Allah, these are the last moments of <br><br>143 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>10 <br>my life. You know that I have always <br>loved Thee. Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me. I <br>would be with the Prop-het (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) at times when no one else was there. I once com- <br>plained to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>about my poor memory. He said, 'Spread your shawl!' I <br>did so. He made some signs on the shawl with his own <br>hands and said, 'Now wrap this shawl around you.' I <br>wrapped it around my breast. Since then, i never have <br>forgotten anything that I have wished to remember.\" <br>The people of Suftah were residents in the Prophet's <br>mosque. They had no regular source of income. They were <br>the guests of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who <br>transferred to them the Sadaqah and shared with them the <br>gifts that he received. Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was one of them. He would, sometimes, go without food for <br>days together and sometimes would behave like a lunatic, <br>due to 5p-.cessive hunger, as we have already seen in Chap- <br>ter I1I:Iri spite of such difficulties, he was all the time occu- <br>pied in memorising the sayings of the Prophet. <br>This enabled him to narrate such a large number of <br>Ahadith Imaam Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullahi alaih) has attribu- <br>ted as many as 5 374 Ahadith to him. Once he narrated the <br>following Hadith:- <br>\"A person participating in a funeral gets one Qeeraat of <br>reward if he returns after the funeral service, but gets <br>two Qeeraats of reward if he remains there till the <br>burial is over, and one Qeeraat is weightier than mount <br>Uhud.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) heard <br>this and doubted authenticity of the Hadith, saying: <br>\"0.Abu Hurairah! Think before you speak.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) got upset over <br>this and took Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to Hadhrat 'Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), and said to <br>her: <br>\"0,Ummul-Mo'minin, I request you to say by Allah if <br>you have beard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) the Hadith regarding Qeeraats of reward?\" <br>She said: \"Yes. I have heard this Hadith.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) then said to <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"During the Prophet's time, I had no tree to plant in <br>the orchard and no merchandise to sell in the market. I <br>was always with the Prophet. My only job was to mem- <br>orise what the Prophet said, and to eat only what he <br>gave me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyal.lQho anho) said: <br>\"No doubt. Of us all, you were the most constant in at- <br>tendance to him and therefore most informed about ths <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>With all these achievements, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I recite Istighfar 12000 time daily.\" <br>He had a piece of thread with 1000 knots. He would <br>not go to sleep until he had said Subhanallah on all of <br>these knots. <br>7. \t Death of Musailamah and Compilation of QW'&. <br>Musailamah was an imposter who called himself a <br>Rrophet, even during the life time of the Prophet (Sallal- <br><br></p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br>0,<br>13 <br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br><br>14 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br><br>34 <br>16 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>2 <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>17 / <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br><br></p></div>"

It was this force that made them forego <br>their luxuries, forget their lives, give up all their desires for <br>wealth, ignore all afflictions, and have no fear of death <br>even. There is no room for any other consideration (except <br>that of beloved) in the heart saturated with love. May Allah <br>through His Grace grant us His own love and that of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), so that we may be <br>blessed with devotion in His worship and have sense of <br>comfort in all difficulties faced in His service. <br>1. Abu Bakr's [Radhiyallaho anho) Sufferings for Islam. <br>In the beginning, those who embraced Islam had to <br>keep their faith secret, as far as possible. As the Muslims <br>were being constantly persecuted by the Qureysh, even the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised all new con- <br>verts to practise Islam secretly, so that they might not have <br>to suffer at the hands of Qureysh. When, however, the <br>number of Muslims reached 39, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) made a suggestion for the open preaching and prac- <br>tising of Islam. ThepProphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>would not agree, but, when Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>insisted. he gave his consent and so all of them went to <br>Haram for Tabligh. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) began to <br>speak, and the Khutbah given by him was the first ever de- <br>livered in the annals of Islam. Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>i <br>the Prophet's uncle and the Chief of Martyrs embraced <br>k <br>Islam on that very day, while 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came into the Muslim fold on the third day of this address. <br>No sooner did Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) start speaking <br>I<br>than the idolaters and disbelievers from amongst the Qu- <br>reysh fell upon the Muslims from all sides. Despite the fact <br>that he was considered to be the noblest and most respect- <br>able of all the people in Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was beaten to such an extent that his nose and ears <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>241 4c <br>$2<br>and his entire face were besmeared with blood. He was <br>kicked. thrashed with shoes, trampled under feet and han- <br>8 1  <br>dled most roughly and savagely. He became unconscious <br>vlI g  <br>and half-dead; none hoped that he would ever survive this <br>brutal onslaught. Banu Teem, the people of his clan, came <br>and carried him to his house. They also announced in the <br>Haram that if Abu Bakr succumbed to the injuries, they <br>would in retaliation take the life of Utbah bin Rabee'ah, <br>who had taken the most active part in the attack. Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) remained unconscious the whole day. <br>People round him shouted his name again and again to <br>know if he was in senses, but he would not speak. Late in <br>the evening however he opened his eyes and showed signs <br>of consciousness. As soon as he was able to speak, he en- <br>quired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>The people were most disappointed with him and they <br>said: <br>\"How is it that, despite all this calamity and after vir- <br>tually remaining in the jaws of death all day long on <br>account of the Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as <br>soon as he has come back to consciousness he has <br>nothing else to talk about, but the Prophet himself.\" <br>They left Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), much disgusted at <br>his devotion for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while they were satisfied that he was out of danger. They <br>advised Umme Khair, his mother, to give him something to <br>eat. But least minding his food, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) would incessantly and impatiently ask his mother <br>the same question again and again i.e. <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>On her showing ignorance about the welfare of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), Abu Bakr entreated <br>her to go to Umme Jamil (Umar's sister) and find out from <br>her the latest news about the Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The mother could not refuse the request of her son <br>in this pitiable condition, and hurried to Umme Jamil's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) house to enquire about the welfare of <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Like,other Mus- <br>lims of that time, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallah anha) was also <br>keeping her faith secret. She therefore concealed her <br><br></p></div>"

If I could make somebody prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah, I would ask the wives to prostrate <br>before their husbands.\" <br>The following is reported to have been said by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in this connection: <br>(1) \"A woman whose husband is pleased with her at <br>the time of her death goes straight into Paradise.\" <br>(2) \t \"A woman is cursed by the angels if her husband <br>is displeased with her, and she stays away from <br>him in anger for the night.\" <br>(3) \t \"The Salaat of two persons hardly rises beyond <br>their heads in its flight to heaven. These two per- <br>sons are a run-away slave and a disobedient wife.\" <br>14. \t The Story of Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha) is one <br>of those Ansar who embraced Islam in the very beginning. <br>She was among the group that vowed allegience to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at Al-Aqabah. Al- <br>Aqabah in Arabic means a narrow Mountain Pass. In the <br>early days of Islam, the new Muslims were persecuted by <br>Qureysh very badly. They would put all hurdles in the way <br>of Tabligh. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), there- <br>fore, carried on his mission quietly and secretly. People <br>from Madinah who used to come to Mecca for Hajj usually <br>embraced Islam secretly in a mountain pass near Mina, so <br>that Qureysh might not see them. She was in the third such <br>group from Madinah. She participated in most of the <br>battles that were fought after emigration. She took promi- <br>nent part in Uhud, Hudeybiah, Khaiber. Umratul Qadha, <br>Huneyn and Yamamah. <br>In the battle of Uhud, she was forty-three. Her husband <br>and two sons were also fighting in the battle. She took a <br>Q) <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>189 $ 3  <br>8 2 <br>leather bottle full of water and headed for Uhud. In the be- <br>.e <br>ginning, the Muslims had an upper hand, but the tables g*<br>were turned in another moment and the enemy were in the <br>winning position. She had reached the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), when wave after wave of enemy troops <br>rushed to attack and kill him. She shielded the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) whenever anybody ap-<br>proached him. She had a cloth-belt round her waist full of <br>pieces of lint. She tended the wounded. She herself got <br>about twelve wounds, one of which was very serious. <br>Hadhrat Umme Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I once saw a very deep cut on the shoulder of Hadhrat <br>Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha). I inquired how <br>she had got that. She said, 'I got it in Uhud. When <br>people were running about in confusion, I saw Ibn <br>Qumiah coming towards us and shouting, 'where is <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Let some-<br>body tell me his whereabouts. If he is saved today, I <br>am no more.' I, Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some others intercepted him. He gave <br>me this deep cut on my shoulder. I also attacked him, <br>but he escaped on account of the double coat of mail <br>that he was wearing.\" <br>In spite of a year's treatment, the wound would not heal. In <br>the meantime, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided about the expedition to Hamra-ul-Asad. Hadhrat <br>Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha) also got ready to join <br>the expedition. But as her wound was still unhealed, she <br>could not participate. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) returned from the expedition, he straight away <br>went to visit Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). He was very happy to find her better. <br>She says: <br>\"In fact, we were very much handicapped in Uhud. <br>The enemy had very strong cavalry, while we fought <br>on foot. There would have been a fair fight if they too <br>had been on foot. When somebody came riding on his <br>horse to attack me, I stopped his sword on my shield <br>and when he turned about, I attacked his horse from <br>the rear and cut its leg. This caused the horse as well <br>as the rider to fall on the ground. As soon as this hap- <br>pened, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would <br><br>190 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>shout to my son, who would run to my help and then <br>we both finished the man in no time.\" <br>Her son Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I had a wound on my left arm, which would not stop <br>bleeding. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said to my mother, 'Put a bandage over it.' My mother <br>took out a bandage from her belt and after bandaging <br>f'<br>my wound, said, 'Now, son. go and fight again with <br>the idolaters.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was watching us. He said, '0, Umme Ammarah, <br>who can have courage like yours?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at that time <br>prayed again and again for Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) and her family. Hadhra: Umme Ammarah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was standing with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), when one of the enemy passed in front of me. <br>The Pro~;?et (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] said to me, <br>Umme Ammarah! He is the man who wounded your <br>son.' I jumped at hirn and hit his leg. It made him fall <br>down. We then went foiward and finished him. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) smiled and said, <br>'Umme Ammarah has avenged her son.' When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was praying for <br>us, I said to him, '0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for my <br>company with you in Paradise.' He favoured me with <br>this prayer too, and after that I cared little for what <br>happened to me ,in this life.\" <br>As has already been said, she also participated in <br>many other battles with the same zeal and spirit. After the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she took <br>part in the fierce battle of Yamamah, which was fought <br>with the renegades. She lost one of her arms and received <br>eleven other wounds in this battle. She was forty-three in <br>Uhud and fifty-two in Yamamah. Her heroism in these <br>battles at that age was really miraculous. <br>15. \t Story of Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) was the <br>wife of Ikramah bin Abi Jahl. She participated in Uhud on <br>the enemy side. She embraced Islam on the fall of Mecca. <br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6. Spirit for Islam <br>191 <br>She loved her husband very much, who would not become <br>a Muslim on account of his father, who was the worst <br>enemy of Islam.

She secured pardon for him from the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and went to Yemen and induced <br>her husband to return to his home. She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts. We shall <br>meet after they are done away with.\" <br>He said: \"I am sure I shall not survive this battle.\" <br>They then shared the bed for the first time in a tent at that <br>place. Next day, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was arranging for the Walimah when the enemy at- <br>tacked with full force and he was killed in the battle. Hadh- <br>rat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) packed up her tent <br>and other luggage, and, with a tent-peg in her hand, fought <br>the enemy till she had killed seven of them. <br>In war times, not to speak of a woman, no man would <br>like to get married under such circumstances. Look at her <br>marriage in the battle-field and her fight with the enemy! <br>Instead of mourning the loss of her husband on the day of <br>his death, she rushes in to the battle-field and kills seven of <br>the enemy soldiers single-handed. Is this not enough to <br>show the wonderful strength of Iman in women of that <br>time? <br>16. \t Martyrdom of Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) is the mother <br>of 'Hadhrat Ammar (Radhiyallaho anho), whose story we <br>have already read in Chapter V. Just like 'Hadhrat Ammar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) her son, and Yasir her husband, she <br><br>192 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>193<br>Ch. X :  Women's Courage S. Spirit for Islam <br>13 <br>patiently bore the hardships in various forms in the cause <br>i <br>of Islam. She would not weaken in her love for and devo- <br>tion to Islam in spite of all these afflictions. One day, <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was standing <br>when Abu Jahl passed that way. He flung all sorts of dirty <br>words at her and then put his spear through her private <br>parts. She died on account of the wound. She is the first to <br>meet martyrdom for the cause of Islam. <br>Patience, perseverence and sacrifice of these ladies are <br>really enviable. No affliction is too much when a person <br>blessed with the spirit of Islam is determined to bear it. We <br>hear about hundreds of persons dying for one cause or the <br>other. It is only dying for the cause of Allah that brings <br>eternal happiness and comfort in the life to come. Persons <br>losing their lives for material gains really lose twice, i.e., in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. <br>17. The story of Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). <br>Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anha) is <br>the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>mother of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and step-sister of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). She is one of the famous women of her time. She <br>was the eighteenth person to embrace Islam. She was <br>twenty-seven years old at the time of the Hijrat. After the <br>migration from Mecca, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Madinah safely, they sent Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some other Sahabah to bring their families <br>from Mecca. Hadhrdt Asma (Radhiyallaho anho) came to <br>Madinah with Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>family. When she reached Quba, she gave birth to Hadh- <br>rat-Abdullah <br>bin-Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), the first <br>Muslim baby born since the Hijrat. She says: <br>\"When I was married to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), he had neither money nor property of any kind. <br>He had only one camel for carrying water and one <br>horse. I would bring fodder for the animals and date- <br>stones to feed them in lieu of grass, bring water from <br>the well, mend bucket myself when needed, and <br>attend to other domestic duties. Attending to the horse <br>was the most difficult of all jobs. I was not good at <br>baking and, therefore, after kneading the flour, I would <br>take it to Ansar women in my neighbourhood, who <br>would bake bread for me. When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it. (In fact, <br>Sahabah remained occupied in striving in the path of <br>Allah and all other such jobs had to be done by their <br>womenfolk. Sometime later, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) transferred to us a servant that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given to him. <br>I was therefore relieved of attending to the horse, <br>which had been really very hard for me.\" <br>18. \t Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) Pacifies her <br>Grandfather. <br>When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) emi- <br>grated to Madinah in the company of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), he took with him all his money, <br>thinking that the Prophet might need it. It was about 6 000 <br>dirhams. After his departure, his father Abu Quhafah (who <br>was blind and who had not till then accepted Islam) came <br>to express his synlpathy with his granddaughters. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Our grandfather came to us and said, 'Your father has <br>shocked you with his migration to Madinah, and <br>seems to have put you to further hardship by taking all <br>his money with him.' I said, 'No grandfather, do not <br>worry. He has left a lot of money for us.' I collected <br>some pebbles and deposited them in the recess where <br><br>194 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>my father used to keep his money; I covered it with a <br>cloth. I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>said: <br>\"No body's wealth has benefited me so much as that of <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). I have com- <br>pensated everybody for the good done to me, except <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). He shall be <br>compensated by Allah Himself.\" <br>19. \t Hadhrat Asma '(Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending in <br>Charity. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the path of Allah. In the beginning, <br>she used to spend carefully with measure and weight. Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to her: <br>\"0,Asma, do not put by and be calculating; spend in <br>the path of Allah liberally.\" <br>After this, she started spending most generously. She <br>would advise her daughters and house maids: <br>\"Don't wait for any surplus or excess' of requirements <br>before spending in the path of Allah. As the require- <br>ments go on increasing in the chances of having some- <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>195 <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age. She came of age and then accepted Islam. She was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. Her husband <br>fought in Badr for Qureysh and fell a captive to the Mus- <br>lims. <br>When the Qureysh were paying ransom to secure re- <br>lease of their prisoners, Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) gave over as ransom for her husband the necklace <br>she had received in dowry from her mother Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha). When the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saw the necklace, the memories of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) came to his mind and <br>tears were in his eyes. After consultation with Sahabah, he <br>returned the necklace to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>ahna) and released her husband without ransom on the <br>condition that he would send Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) to Madinah on his return to Mecca. Two men <br>were sent to stay outside Mecca and bring Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) safely to Madinah, when she was <br>made over to them. Her husband asked his brother Kinanah <br>to take Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) outside Mecca <br>and make her over to the Muslim escort. As Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) and Kinanah were moving out <br>of the town on camel's back, the Qureysh sent a party to in- <br>tercept them. Her own cousin Habar bin Aswad flung a <br><br>196 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave. This was all <br>for the instruction of his followers. (0,Allah! protect us <br>from the horrors of the grave by Thy special Favour. Grace <br>and Bounty). <br>I<br>*,+;C, & i;Chi;, r;611, <br>21. Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) High-minded- <br>ness: <br>Rubayyi-bint-Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha) was a <br>woman of Ansar, who had participated in many battles, by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>nursed the wounded and carried the dead bodies during <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>197 3<br>h= <br>0s <br>the battle. She had accepted Islam before the Prophet emi- <br>'G8 a <br>grated to Madinah. She was married when the Prophet was <br>~m <br>i \t<br>in Madinah. He graced her marriage with his presence. He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father. She, therefore, retorted: <br>\"No. I am the daughter of one who killed his slave.\" <br>Asma did not like this epithet for Abu Jahl, and said with <br>anger: <br>\"It is haram for me to sell perfume to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho hnha) said, in the same <br>strain, <br>\"It is haram for me to buy perfume from you. I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam. She could <br>not tolerate an enemy of Islam being mentioned as a chief. <br>We hear from the lips of Muslims most flowery and high <br><br></p></div>"

I am however <br>sorry to learn about the condition of your son; if you <br>like, I can go with you to see him.\" <br>Umme Khair agreed and they both came to Abu Bakr. On <br>seeing Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in that miserable con- <br>dition, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) could not control <br>herself and began to cry, saying: <br>\"Woe to the ruffians for what they have done to a man <br>like Abu Bakr. May Allah punish them for their mis- <br>conduct.\" <br>Regardless of what Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) said, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had the same words on his <br>lips viz: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil (pointing towards Umme Khair): <br>\"Is it safe to say anything in her presence?\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"Do not worry about her.

I will not eat anything until I <br>have looked at him.\" <br>Now, his mother was very anxious to feed him. She <br>knew that when he had sworn by Allah he would not break <br>his oath and, therefore, would not eat under any circum- <br>stances. She therefore agreed to take him to Arqam's place. <br>She had to wait till the street was least-frequented by the <br>people and she was able to take him to that place unde- <br>tected by Qureysh. When they both reached Arqam's place, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and clung to him weeping profusely. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reciprocated, and all <br>the Muslims who were present there also began to weep <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>bitterly over the condition of Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) then iptroduced his <br>mother Umme Khair to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), saying: <br>\"She is my mother, 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for her <br>and induce her to accept Islam.\" <br>The prophet first prayed for her and then preached to her. <br>She accepted Islam there and then. <br>Many people can claim to be lovers while in ease and <br>comfort. But a lover is a real lover when he is able to prove <br>his love even in the tribulation and adversity. <br>2. \t<br>'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Grief at the Prophet's <br>Death. <br>None can deny the proverbial valour, courage and <br>strength of 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), over whose men- <br>tion, even after the lapse of 1400 years, hearts are struck <br>with awe and respect. Islam could not be professed and <br>preached openly before 'Umar's coming into its fold. As <br>soon as he embraced Islam, the Muslims started saying <br>Salaat in the Haram, as none could dare harm them with <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their side. Notwithstanding <br>all this, he could not bear the shock of the Prophet passing <br>away. So much so that he stood with sword in his hand, ut- <br>terly confused and bewildered, saying: <br>\"I shall behead the person who says that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has passed away. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has only gone to <br>visit his Lord, just as Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone <br>to Toor. He will shortly return and cut off the hands <br>and feet of those who were spreading the false news of <br>his death.\" <br>On the other hand, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>stunned with grief on this event. He could not utter a single <br>word, even till the next day, and walked about as if bereft <br>of speech. Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), too, was in terrible <br>grief. He was still and motionless. Only Abu Bakr, (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) for all his love of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as we have seen in the last story, stood <br>firm as a rock against this terrible storm of grief and did not <br>lose his mental composure.

The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was watching us. He said, '0, Umme Ammarah, <br>who can have courage like yours?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at that time <br>prayed again and again for Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) and her family. Hadhra: Umme Ammarah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was standing with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), when one of the enemy passed in front of me. <br>The Pro~;?et (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] said to me, <br>Umme Ammarah!

He favoured me with <br>this prayer too, and after that I cared little for what <br>happened to me ,in this life.\" <br>As has already been said, she also participated in <br>many other battles with the same zeal and spirit. After the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she took <br>part in the fierce battle of Yamamah, which was fought <br>with the renegades. She lost one of her arms and received <br>eleven other wounds in this battle. She was forty-three in <br>Uhud and fifty-two in Yamamah. Her heroism in these <br>battles at that age was really miraculous. <br>15. \t Story of Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) was the <br>wife of Ikramah bin Abi Jahl. She participated in Uhud on <br>the enemy side. She embraced Islam on the fall of Mecca. <br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6.

After the fall of Mecca, her husband fled to <br>Yemen. She secured pardon for him from the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and went to Yemen and induced <br>her husband to return to his home. She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts.

Next day, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was arranging for the Walimah when the enemy at- <br>tacked with full force and he was killed in the battle. Hadh- <br>rat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) packed up her tent <br>and other luggage, and, with a tent-peg in her hand, fought <br>the enemy till she had killed seven of them. <br>In war times, not to speak of a woman, no man would <br>like to get married under such circumstances.

Just like 'Hadhrat Ammar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) her son, and Yasir her husband, she <br><br>192 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>193<br>Ch. X :  Women's Courage S. Spirit for Islam <br>13 <br>patiently bore the hardships in various forms in the cause <br>i <br>of Islam. She would not weaken in her love for and devo- <br>tion to Islam in spite of all these afflictions. One day, <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was standing <br>when Abu Jahl passed that way. He flung all sorts of dirty <br>words at her and then put his spear through her private <br>parts. She died on account of the wound. She is the first to <br>meet martyrdom for the cause of Islam. <br>Patience, perseverence and sacrifice of these ladies are <br>really enviable. No affliction is too much when a person <br>blessed with the spirit of Islam is determined to bear it. We <br>hear about hundreds of persons dying for one cause or the <br>other. It is only dying for the cause of Allah that brings <br>eternal happiness and comfort in the life to come. Persons <br>losing their lives for material gains really lose twice, i.e., in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. <br>17. The story of Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). <br>Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anha) is <br>the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>mother of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and step-sister of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). She is one of the famous women of her time. She <br>was the eighteenth person to embrace Islam. She was <br>twenty-seven years old at the time of the Hijrat. After the <br>migration from Mecca, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Madinah safely, they sent Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some other Sahabah to bring their families <br>from Mecca. Hadhrdt Asma (Radhiyallaho anho) came to <br>Madinah with Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>family. When she reached Quba, she gave birth to Hadh- <br>rat-Abdullah <br>bin-Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), the first <br>Muslim baby born since the Hijrat. She says: <br>\"When I was married to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), he had neither money nor property of any kind. <br>He had only one camel for carrying water and one <br>horse. I would bring fodder for the animals and date- <br>stones to feed them in lieu of grass, bring water from <br>the well, mend bucket myself when needed, and <br>attend to other domestic duties. Attending to the horse <br>was the most difficult of all jobs. I was not good at <br>baking and, therefore, after kneading the flour, I would <br>take it to Ansar women in my neighbourhood, who <br>would bake bread for me. When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it. (In fact, <br>Sahabah remained occupied in striving in the path of <br>Allah and all other such jobs had to be done by their <br>womenfolk. Sometime later, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) transferred to us a servant that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given to him. <br>I was therefore relieved of attending to the horse, <br>which had been really very hard for me.\" <br>18. \t Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) Pacifies her <br>Grandfather. <br>When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) emi- <br>grated to Madinah in the company of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), he took with him all his money, <br>thinking that the Prophet might need it. It was about 6 000 <br>dirhams. After his departure, his father Abu Quhafah (who <br>was blind and who had not till then accepted Islam) came <br>to express his synlpathy with his granddaughters. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Our grandfather came to us and said, 'Your father has <br>shocked you with his migration to Madinah, and <br>seems to have put you to further hardship by taking all <br>his money with him.' I said, 'No grandfather, do not <br>worry. He has left a lot of money for us.' I collected <br>some pebbles and deposited them in the recess where <br><br>194 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>my father used to keep his money; I covered it with a <br>cloth. I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>said: <br>\"No body's wealth has benefited me so much as that of <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). I have com- <br>pensated everybody for the good done to me, except <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). He shall be <br>compensated by Allah Himself.\" <br>19. \t Hadhrat Asma '(Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending in <br>Charity. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the path of Allah. In the beginning, <br>she used to spend carefully with measure and weight. Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to her: <br>\"0,Asma, do not put by and be calculating; spend in <br>the path of Allah liberally.\" <br>After this, she started spending most generously. She <br>would advise her daughters and house maids: <br>\"Don't wait for any surplus or excess' of requirements <br>before spending in the path of Allah. As the require- <br>ments go on increasing in the chances of having some- <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>195 <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age. She came of age and then accepted Islam. She was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. Her husband <br>fought in Badr for Qureysh and fell a captive to the Mus- <br>lims. <br>When the Qureysh were paying ransom to secure re- <br>lease of their prisoners, Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) gave over as ransom for her husband the necklace <br>she had received in dowry from her mother Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha). When the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saw the necklace, the memories of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) came to his mind and <br>tears were in his eyes. After consultation with Sahabah, he <br>returned the necklace to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>ahna) and released her husband without ransom on the <br>condition that he would send Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) to Madinah on his return to Mecca. Two men <br>were sent to stay outside Mecca and bring Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) safely to Madinah, when she was <br>made over to them. Her husband asked his brother Kinanah <br>to take Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) outside Mecca <br>and make her over to the Muslim escort. As Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) and Kinanah were moving out <br>of the town on camel's back, the Qureysh sent a party to in- <br>tercept them. Her own cousin Habar bin Aswad flung a <br><br>196 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave. This was all <br>for the instruction of his followers. (0,Allah! protect us <br>from the horrors of the grave by Thy special Favour. Grace <br>and Bounty). <br>I<br>*,+;C, & i;Chi;, r;611, <br>21. Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) High-minded- <br>ness: <br>Rubayyi-bint-Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha) was a <br>woman of Ansar, who had participated in many battles, by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>nursed the wounded and carried the dead bodies during <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>197 3<br>h= <br>0s <br>the battle. She had accepted Islam before the Prophet emi- <br>'G8 a <br>grated to Madinah. She was married when the Prophet was <br>~m <br>i \t<br>in Madinah. He graced her marriage with his presence. He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father. She, therefore, retorted: <br>\"No. I am the daughter of one who killed his slave.\" <br>Asma did not like this epithet for Abu Jahl, and said with <br>anger: <br>\"It is haram for me to sell perfume to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho hnha) said, in the same <br>strain, <br>\"It is haram for me to buy perfume from you. I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam. She could <br>not tolerate an enemy of Islam being mentioned as a chief. <br>We hear from the lips of Muslims most flowery and high <br><br>198 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Ch.

You displease Allah <br>when you take him as a chief.\" <br>22. Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>this marriage could not take place. Her first husband was <br>Atiq bin Aa'iz. She had a daughter from him, whose name <br>was Hind. H'nd grew up and embraced Islam, and she was <br>the mother o \\ many children. On the death of Atiq. Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Abu Halah and got <br>two children from him viz. Hind and Halah. Hind lived up <br>to the time of Ali's Caliphate. On the dzath of Abu Halah, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her as his <br>first wife. She died in Ramadhan of the 10th year of the <br>mission at the age df sixty-five. He loved her very much <br>and did not marry any other woman during her life time. <br>She was populprly called Tahirah (Clean and pure) even <br>before Islam. Her children from other husbands are there- <br>fore known as Banu Tahirah. Her virtues and privileges <br>have been mentioned extensively (in Hadith). The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) laid her in the grave with his <br>own hands. The funeral service had not till then been en- <br>joined. <br>(2)Hadhrat Sauda (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>L. <br>Hadhrat Sauda bint Zam'ah bin Qais (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was previously married to her cousin Hadhrat <br>Sukran bin 'Amor (Radhiyallaho anho). The couple em- <br>braced Islam and emigrated to Abysinnia. Hadhrat Sukran <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>favour of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), but I <br>don't like to be divorced (by you). I wish to be in Par- <br>adise as one of your wives.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to this <br>suggestion. She died in about 55 A. H. towards the end of <br>the Khilafat of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>There was another Qureysh woman of the same name. <br>She was also a widow having about six children. The <br>Prophet offered to marry her, but she said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than any <br>other person in this world. I do not like my children to <br>be a nuisance to you.\" <br>He appreciated this, and withdrew the offer. <br>(3)Hadhrat A.ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) too was married <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in Swawwal of <br>the 10th year of the Nubuwwat. She was born in the 4th <br>year of Nubuwwat and was married when she was six, but <br>was actually sent by her parents to live with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) after his emigration to Madi- <br>nah, when she was nine. She was eighteen at the time of <br><br></p></div>"

He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels.

Again. it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) alone who knew better than anybody else about the <br>regulations regarding the burial, inheritance, etc, of the <br>Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam). When difference of <br>opinion arose among the Sahabah whether the burial place <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) be at Mecca or <br>Madinah or jerusalenl, it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) who settled the difference by saying on the authority <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the Proph- <br>ets are buried where they have died. There were several <br>other Ahadith known only to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that helped solve many of the other problems arising <br>/<br>out of the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>t <br>lam). Some of these Ahadith were: \t<br>i <br>(1) \"Prophets have no heirs. All that a Prophet leaves <br>behind is Sadaqah.\" <br>i<br>1 <br>(2) \t\"Allah's curse is on the Amir who does not take <br>proper interest and excercise proper care in the ap- <br>pointment of his deputies.\" <br>Ch.

An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was told that he was safe and sound, but she would not rest <br>contented, and insisted on seeing him herself. When at last <br>she had satisfied her eyes with his sight, she said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, every affliction is eased and every <br>worry removed with the blessing of seeing you.\" <br>According to another version, she herself clung to the <br>Prophet's robes and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to me than my par- <br>ents. The death of my kinsmen has lost all its sting for <br>me when I have seen you living.\" <br>There are several incidents of this kind that occurred <br>after the battle of Uhud. It is, perhaps, for the large number <br>of such incidents that different names have been reported <br>by different narrators about these women. In fact, such in- <br>cidents happened in large numbers with many women of <br>that time. <br>4. <br>The Behaviour of Sahabah at Hudeybiyah. <br>The campaign of Hudeybiyah took place in 6 A.H., <br>when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with a large <br>number of Sahabah was going to Mecca with the intention <br><br>246 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>otherwise not.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to the pro- <br>posal of ~ b b  <br>to<br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and decided <br>march ahead towards Mecca. When he reached Hudey- <br>biyah, Budail bin Waraqa Khuza'i met him with a group of <br>! <br>people. He said: <br>\"The Qureysh uncler no circumstances will permit <br>i <br>your entry intb Mecca. They are already drawn up in <br>battle array.\" <br>At this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>I <br>\"We have come to perform 'Umrah only and have no <br>intention to fight. Frequent battles have already inflic- <br>ted heavy casualties on Qureysh. If, therefore, they <br>agree, I am prepared to talk over a no-war pact with <br>them, so that they do not fight with me and I may deal <br>with others. If, however, Qureysh do not see their way <br>to accepting this proposal, then by Him who holds my <br>i<br>life in His hand, I will fight them till at last either <br>i<br>Islam prevails or I am slain.\" <br>I <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>247 <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah: <br>\"Go and faun upon your goddess 'Lat'! We will by no <br>means flee away and leave the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) by himself.\" <br>'Urwah asked: \"Who is he?\" <br>The Prophet: <br>'Urwah: <br>\"He is Abu Bakr.\" <br>\"Abu Bakr! I am in<br>turn you have done <br>for this, I would <br>abuse.\" <br>debted <br>to m<br>have <br>to you f<br>replied <br>e in the <br>or a <br>to <br>good <br>past. But <br>your <br>'Urwah then resumed his deliberations with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). 'Urwah occasionally touched <br>the beard of the Prophet (according to the Arab custom) as <br>he talked. The Sahabah could not tolerate this. Accord- <br>ingly, 'Urwah's own nephew Mughirah bin Shu'bah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was standing armed near by, struck <br>Urwah's hand with the handle of his sword and said: <br>\"Keep your hand away.\" <br>'Urwah: <br>\"Who is he?\" <br><br>248 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>1 <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>1 <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the <br>ground arid anoint their faces with it. Hardly a word <br>escapes his lips before all of them run to carry out his <br>wish. When he makes Wudhu, they fight with one an- <br>other to collect some drop of the used water before it <br>t <br>falls on the ground. If any one fails to get that water. he <br>touches the wet hands of the persori who had got it <br>arid then rubs his own hands on the face. When they <br>speak in his presence, they speak in low voice. They <br>I <br>do not lift their gaze to look at his face, out of respect <br>! <br>for him. A hair falling from his head or beard is pre- <br>served to get benediction from it arid is looked upon as <br>i<br>a sacred relic. In short, I have never seen any group of <br>people so devoted to their master as I have seen the <br>companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) towards him.\" <br>At long last, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was commis- <br>sioned by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to nego- <br>tiate with the Qureysh, as he, in spite of his conversion to <br>Islam, commanded respect with them. When 'Usman (Rad- <br>hivallaho anho) had left for Mecca, some of the Sahabah <br>envied Usman's luck in (as they thought) being able to per- <br>form l'awaf of the house of Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on the other hand remarked: <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>249 s= <br>a\"\" <br>o a  <br>\"I do not think he will ever like to do 'l'awaf without <br>me.\" <br>However when 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) entered <br>Mecca, Abaan bi'il Sa'eed took him in his protection and <br>said to him: <br>.:$<br>Svl<br>fa <br>\"You roam where you like. Nobody car1 touch vou.\" <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) carried 011 his negotiations <br>with Abu Sufyan and other chiefs of Mecca on behalf of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and, when he was <br>about to return, the Qureysh the~nselves said to him: <br>\"Now when vou are here at Mecca, you can perforin <br>Tawaf before you return.\" <br>He replied: \"How can it be possible for me when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihc wasailam) has been <br>prevented by you <br>people from ellterilig <br>Mecca.\" <br>This reply was nlost unpalatable for the Qureysh and they <br>decided to detain 'Usman (Kadhivallaho anho) at Mecca. A <br>news reached the Muslims that 'Usnlan (Kadhiyallilho <br>aliho) had been martyred. On this news reaching the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he took the oath of al- <br>legiance from all Sahabah ta fight to the litst drop of their <br>blood. When the Qureysh learnt of this, they got frighteried <br>and imrnediatelv released 'Usrnan (liadhiyallaho anho). <br>In this story, Abu 13akr's (liadhivallaho anho) insultitlg <br>'Urrvah.

The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said to my mother, 'Put a bandage over it.' My mother <br>took out a bandage from her belt and after bandaging <br>f'<br>my wound, said, 'Now, son. go and fight again with <br>the idolaters.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was watching us. He said, '0, Umme Ammarah, <br>who can have courage like yours?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at that time <br>prayed again and again for Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) and her family. Hadhra: Umme Ammarah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was standing with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), when one of the enemy passed in front of me. <br>The Pro~;?et (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] said to me, <br>Umme Ammarah! He is the man who wounded your <br>son.' I jumped at hirn and hit his leg. It made him fall <br>down. We then went foiward and finished him. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) smiled and said, <br>'Umme Ammarah has avenged her son.' When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was praying for <br>us, I said to him, '0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for my <br>company with you in Paradise.' He favoured me with <br>this prayer too, and after that I cared little for what <br>happened to me ,in this life.\" <br>As has already been said, she also participated in <br>many other battles with the same zeal and spirit. After the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she took <br>part in the fierce battle of Yamamah, which was fought <br>with the renegades. She lost one of her arms and received <br>eleven other wounds in this battle. She was forty-three in <br>Uhud and fifty-two in Yamamah. Her heroism in these <br>battles at that age was really miraculous. <br>15. \t Story of Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) was the <br>wife of Ikramah bin Abi Jahl. She participated in Uhud on <br>the enemy side. She embraced Islam on the fall of Mecca. <br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6. Spirit for Islam <br>191 <br>She loved her husband very much, who would not become <br>a Muslim on account of his father, who was the worst <br>enemy of Islam. After the fall of Mecca, her husband fled to <br>Yemen. She secured pardon for him from the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and went to Yemen and induced <br>her husband to return to his home. She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts. We shall <br>meet after they are done away with.\" <br>He said: \"I am sure I shall not survive this battle.\" <br>They then shared the bed for the first time in a tent at that <br>place. Next day, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was arranging for the Walimah when the enemy at- <br>tacked with full force and he was killed in the battle. Hadh- <br>rat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) packed up her tent <br>and other luggage, and, with a tent-peg in her hand, fought <br>the enemy till she had killed seven of them. <br>In war times, not to speak of a woman, no man would <br>like to get married under such circumstances. Look at her <br>marriage in the battle-field and her fight with the enemy! <br>Instead of mourning the loss of her husband on the day of <br>his death, she rushes in to the battle-field and kills seven of <br>the enemy soldiers single-handed. Is this not enough to <br>show the wonderful strength of Iman in women of that <br>time? <br>16. \t Martyrdom of Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) is the mother <br>of 'Hadhrat Ammar (Radhiyallaho anho), whose story we <br>have already read in Chapter V. Just like 'Hadhrat Ammar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) her son, and Yasir her husband, she <br><br>192 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>193<br>Ch. X :  Women's Courage S. Spirit for Islam <br>13 <br>patiently bore the hardships in various forms in the cause <br>i <br>of Islam. She would not weaken in her love for and devo- <br>tion to Islam in spite of all these afflictions. One day, <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was standing <br>when Abu Jahl passed that way. He flung all sorts of dirty <br>words at her and then put his spear through her private <br>parts. She died on account of the wound. She is the first to <br>meet martyrdom for the cause of Islam. <br>Patience, perseverence and sacrifice of these ladies are <br>really enviable. No affliction is too much when a person <br>blessed with the spirit of Islam is determined to bear it. We <br>hear about hundreds of persons dying for one cause or the <br>other. It is only dying for the cause of Allah that brings <br>eternal happiness and comfort in the life to come. Persons <br>losing their lives for material gains really lose twice, i.e., in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. <br>17. The story of Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). <br>Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anha) is <br>the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>mother of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and step-sister of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). She is one of the famous women of her time. She <br>was the eighteenth person to embrace Islam. She was <br>twenty-seven years old at the time of the Hijrat. After the <br>migration from Mecca, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Madinah safely, they sent Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some other Sahabah to bring their families <br>from Mecca. Hadhrdt Asma (Radhiyallaho anho) came to <br>Madinah with Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>family. When she reached Quba, she gave birth to Hadh- <br>rat-Abdullah <br>bin-Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), the first <br>Muslim baby born since the Hijrat. She says: <br>\"When I was married to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), he had neither money nor property of any kind. <br>He had only one camel for carrying water and one <br>horse. I would bring fodder for the animals and date- <br>stones to feed them in lieu of grass, bring water from <br>the well, mend bucket myself when needed, and <br>attend to other domestic duties. Attending to the horse <br>was the most difficult of all jobs. I was not good at <br>baking and, therefore, after kneading the flour, I would <br>take it to Ansar women in my neighbourhood, who <br>would bake bread for me. When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it. (In fact, <br>Sahabah remained occupied in striving in the path of <br>Allah and all other such jobs had to be done by their <br>womenfolk. Sometime later, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) transferred to us a servant that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given to him. <br>I was therefore relieved of attending to the horse, <br>which had been really very hard for me.\" <br>18. \t Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) Pacifies her <br>Grandfather. <br>When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) emi- <br>grated to Madinah in the company of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), he took with him all his money, <br>thinking that the Prophet might need it. It was about 6 000 <br>dirhams. After his departure, his father Abu Quhafah (who <br>was blind and who had not till then accepted Islam) came <br>to express his synlpathy with his granddaughters. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Our grandfather came to us and said, 'Your father has <br>shocked you with his migration to Madinah, and <br>seems to have put you to further hardship by taking all <br>his money with him.' I said, 'No grandfather, do not <br>worry. He has left a lot of money for us.' I collected <br>some pebbles and deposited them in the recess where <br><br>194 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>my father used to keep his money; I covered it with a <br>cloth. I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>said: <br>\"No body's wealth has benefited me so much as that of <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). I have com- <br>pensated everybody for the good done to me, except <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). He shall be <br>compensated by Allah Himself.\" <br>19. \t Hadhrat Asma '(Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending in <br>Charity. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the path of Allah. In the beginning, <br>she used to spend carefully with measure and weight. Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to her: <br>\"0,Asma, do not put by and be calculating; spend in <br>the path of Allah liberally.\" <br>After this, she started spending most generously. She <br>would advise her daughters and house maids: <br>\"Don't wait for any surplus or excess' of requirements <br>before spending in the path of Allah. As the require- <br>ments go on increasing in the chances of having some- <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>195 <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age. She came of age and then accepted Islam. She was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. Her husband <br>fought in Badr for Qureysh and fell a captive to the Mus- <br>lims. <br>When the Qureysh were paying ransom to secure re- <br>lease of their prisoners, Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) gave over as ransom for her husband the necklace <br>she had received in dowry from her mother Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha). When the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saw the necklace, the memories of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) came to his mind and <br>tears were in his eyes. After consultation with Sahabah, he <br>returned the necklace to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>ahna) and released her husband without ransom on the <br>condition that he would send Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) to Madinah on his return to Mecca. Two men <br>were sent to stay outside Mecca and bring Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) safely to Madinah, when she was <br>made over to them. Her husband asked his brother Kinanah <br>to take Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) outside Mecca <br>and make her over to the Muslim escort. As Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) and Kinanah were moving out <br>of the town on camel's back, the Qureysh sent a party to in- <br>tercept them. Her own cousin Habar bin Aswad flung a <br><br>196 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave. This was all <br>for the instruction of his followers. (0,Allah! protect us <br>from the horrors of the grave by Thy special Favour. Grace <br>and Bounty). <br>I<br>*,+;C, & i;Chi;, r;611, <br>21. Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) High-minded- <br>ness: <br>Rubayyi-bint-Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha) was a <br>woman of Ansar, who had participated in many battles, by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>nursed the wounded and carried the dead bodies during <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>197 3<br>h= <br>0s <br>the battle. She had accepted Islam before the Prophet emi- <br>'G8 a <br>grated to Madinah. She was married when the Prophet was <br>~m <br>i \t<br>in Madinah. He graced her marriage with his presence. He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father.

I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam.

Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>this marriage could not take place. Her first husband was <br>Atiq bin Aa'iz. She had a daughter from him, whose name <br>was Hind. H'nd grew up and embraced Islam, and she was <br>the mother o \\ many children. On the death of Atiq. Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Abu Halah and got <br>two children from him viz. Hind and Halah. Hind lived up <br>to the time of Ali's Caliphate. On the dzath of Abu Halah, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her as his <br>first wife. She died in Ramadhan of the 10th year of the <br>mission at the age df sixty-five. He loved her very much <br>and did not marry any other woman during her life time. <br>She was populprly called Tahirah (Clean and pure) even <br>before Islam. Her children from other husbands are there- <br>fore known as Banu Tahirah. Her virtues and privileges <br>have been mentioned extensively (in Hadith). The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) laid her in the grave with his <br>own hands. The funeral service had not till then been en- <br>joined. <br>(2)Hadhrat Sauda (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>L. <br>Hadhrat Sauda bint Zam'ah bin Qais (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was previously married to her cousin Hadhrat <br>Sukran bin 'Amor (Radhiyallaho anho). The couple em- <br>braced Islam and emigrated to Abysinnia. Hadhrat Sukran <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>favour of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), but I <br>don't like to be divorced (by you). I wish to be in Par- <br>adise as one of your wives.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to this <br>suggestion. She died in about 55 A. H. towards the end of <br>the Khilafat of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>There was another Qureysh woman of the same name. <br>She was also a widow having about six children. The <br>Prophet offered to marry her, but she said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than any <br>other person in this world. I do not like my children to <br>be a nuisance to you.\" <br>He appreciated this, and withdrew the offer. <br>(3)Hadhrat A.ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) too was married <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in Swawwal of <br>the 10th year of the Nubuwwat. She was born in the 4th <br>year of Nubuwwat and was married when she was six, but <br>was actually sent by her parents to live with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) after his emigration to Madi- <br>nah, when she was nine. She was eighteen at the time of <br><br></p></div>"

The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves. <br>6. \t Abu 'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) loses His Teeth. <br>During the battle of Uhud, when at one time the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was fiercely attacked <br>by the enemy and two links of the helmet worn by him <br>were struck deep into his head (or face). Abu Bakr and Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) ran to help him. Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) started pulling out the links <br>with his teeth. By the time one of the links was out, he had <br>lost one of his teeth. Without minding this, he again used <br>his teeth to pull up the other link as well. He succeeded in <br>taking out that one too, but he had to lose another tooth in <br>the effort. When the links were drawn out, the blood began <br>to ooze out from the Prophet's body. Malik bin Sinaan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the father of Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), licked the blood with his lips. At this, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The fire of Hell cannot touch the person who has my <br>blood mixed with his.\" <br>7. \t Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) Refuses to Go With His <br>Father. <br>Once in pre-Islam days, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory. <br>Alas, my lengthening grief and unending distress.\" <br>\"I shall run my swift camels in search of him. I shall <br>search for him round the universe.\" <br>\"The camels may get tired, but I shall not rest, till I <br>die, for death is the end of every hope.\" <br>\"I shall still enjoin on my sons and such and such <br>people, to keep searching for Zaid even after my <br>death.\" <br>.Some people of his clan happened to meet Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) during their pilgrimage to Mecca. They re- <br>lated to him the story of his father's grief and anguish, and <br>recited to him the couplets which he sang in his memory. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) sent a letter to his father through <br>these people. The letter consisted of three couplets ad- <br>dressed to his father assuring him that he was quite well <br>and happy in the present environments with his noble <br>master. When the people went back, they informed his <br>father of his whereabouts and delivered him Zaid's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) message. On receiving the letter, his father <br>and his uncle left for Mecca with sufficient money to <br>ransom Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho). When they came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) they said: <br><br>252 <br>253 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Yes, I know them. This is my father and <br>that is my uncl'e.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"And you know me too. They have come to <br>take you back to your home. You have my <br>full permission to go with them. If, on the <br>other hand, you chose to stay on with me, <br>you shall have your choice.\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"How can I prefer anybody else to you? You <br>are everybody for me, including my father <br>and my uncle.\" <br>Zaid's father and uncle: <br>\"0.Zaid! Do you prefer to be a slave? How can you <br>leave your own father, uncle and other members of <br>your family, and remain a bondsman?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Verily, I have seen something in my master <br>that makes me prefer him to everybody else <br>in the world.\" <br>On this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) took Zaid <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) in his lap and said: <br>\"From today, I adopt Zaid as my son.\" <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>The father and uncle were quite satisfied with the situation <br>and gladly left Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and returned without him. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was only a child at that time. <br>His preferring to remain a slave, and refusing to go with his <br>own father giving up his home and kith and kin is an ob- <br>vious tribute to his love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). <br>8. \t<br>Anas bin Nadhr's (Radhiyallaho anho) Martyrdom in <br>Uhud. <br>When the Muslims were facing defeat in Uhud, some- <br>body started the rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had been killed. You can imagine the Sahabah's <br>grief and anguish over this tragic news. This, quite natu- <br>rally, caused most of them to lose heart in despair. Anas <br>bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to see 'Umar and <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) with a group of Muslims in <br>a state of utter bewilderment. He said to them: <br>\"Why am I seeing you all so bewildered?\" <br>They said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is slain.\" <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>\"Then who will like to live after him? Come, let us go <br>forward with our swords and join o,ur dear Prophet.\" <br>No sooner did he utter these words than hr plunged <br>into the enemy lines and fought till he was martyred. <br>In fact, Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had such an extreme <br>love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he <br>did not consider this life worth living without him. <br>9. \t<br>Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) Message For The Muslims. <br>During the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What about Sa'd bin Rabee'? I don't know how things <br>have gone with him.\" <br>One of the Sahabah was despatched to search for him. He <br>went to the spot where the bodies of martyrs lay in heaps. <br>He shouted Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) name to know if he <br><br>254 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>was alive. At one place, while he was announcing that he <br>was deputed by the Prophet to enquire about Sa'd bin <br>Rabee' (Radhiyallaho anho), he heard a feeble'voice coming <br>from one direction. He turned to that direction and found <br>that Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was lying among the killed <br>and was about to breathe his last. Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was heard saying: <br>\"Convey my Salaam to the Prophet with my message, <br>'0Prophet of Allah! May Allah grant you on my behalf <br>a reward more exalted and more handsome than the <br>one Allah has ever granted a Prophet on behalf of any <br>of his followers, and tell my Muslim brothers, 'Nothing <br>will absolve you from blame, on the Day of Judgement, <br>if the enemy succeeds in reaching the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) before all of you have fallen.\" <br>With these words, Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) drew his last <br>breath and passed into the presence of Allah. <br>As a matter of fact, the Sahabah have given a true proof <br>of their devotion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). While they suffered wound after wound and were on <br>their last breath, they had no complaint nor wish on their <br>lips and could not think of anything else except about the <br>safety and welfare of the Prophet. Would that a sinner like <br>me be blessed with an atom of the love that the Sahabah <br>bore for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>10. A Woman Dies d n  Seeing the Prophet's Grave. <br>A woman. came to Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and <br>said: <br>\"Take me to the grave of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), so that 1-may be blessed with its sight.\" <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) opened the room that con-<br>tained the grave of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and let her go inside. The woman on seeing the grave <br>started crying in love and memory of the Prophet. In fact <br>she wept so bitterly and incessantly that she swooned and <br>expired there and then (May Allah bless her). The blessed <br>lady recollected the happy days when the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was alive, and then the pangs of sep- <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>aration proved fatal for her. Can the annals of history <br>produce a parallel to such love and devotion? <br>IC1 <br>11. Sahabah's Love For the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and other Anecdotes. <br>Somebody asked Ali (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"How much was the Sahabah's love for the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>He replied: <br>\"By Allah! To us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was dearer than our riches, our children and our <br>mothers, and was more cherishable than a drink of <br>cold water at the time of severest thirst.\" <br>There is no exaggeration kn Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>statement. As a matter of fact, the Sahabah reached this <br>state because of the perfection of their Iman. It could not be <br>otherwise, in the face of what Allah has enjoined viz: <br>\"Say! If your fathers and your sons and your brethren <br>and your wives and your tribe and the wealth you have <br>acquired and the merchandise, for which you fear that <br>there will be no sale, and the dwellings you desire are <br>dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striv- <br>ing in His way, then wait till Allah bringeth His com- <br>mand to pass. Allah guideth not the wrong-doing<br>folk.\" <br>(IX: 24). <br>This verse sounds a note of warning against anything else <br>becoming more attractive than the love of Allah and that of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) report <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"None of you can be a Mo'min until his love-for me is <br>more than his love for his parents, children and all the <br>people of the marld.\" <br><br>256 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>'Ulama say that the love mentioned in this Hadith and <br>others of its kind is the voluntary love and not instinctive <br>love. If, however, it is taken to mean the natural and in- <br>stinctive love, then the word Mo'min will denote the Iman <br>of the highest degree, for instance that of Sahabah. <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he heard from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). \"There are three <br>things which when found in a person enable him to taste <br>the sweetness of real Iman. These are: <br>(1) When Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) are dearer to him than anything else in <br>this world. <br>(2) \t When his love for anyone is solely for the pleasure <br>of Allah, and <br>(3) \t When turning to 'Kufr' is as abhorrent to him as <br>being flung into the fire.\" <br>12. \t Miscellaneous Stories About Sahabah's Love for the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>(1)'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, you are dearer to me <br>than anybody else in the world except my <br>own self.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"No body can be a perfect Momin until I am <br>dearer to him than even his own self.\" <br>t <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Now you are dearer to me than my own <br>self.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Now, O'Umar.\" <br>The 'Ulama have given two meanings to the conclud- <br>ing words of the Prophet viz: <br>(i) \"Now you have the real Iman.\" <br>(ii) \"Why is it that it is only now that \t I am dearer to <br>you than your own self? This should have been so <br>long ago.\" <br>Suhail Tastari (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"No one can have the relish of Sunnat until he takes <br>17 \t<br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>257 <br>$ 4  <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as his Master <br>arid considers himself his (the Prophet's) slave.\" <br>.f 4<br>s3 <br>(2) A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- * <br>sallam) axid asked: <br>\"When shall be the Day of Judgement? 0, Prophet of <br>Allah!\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"What preparations have you made for that <br>Day?\" <br>The person: \t \"0.Prophet of Allah! 1 do not claim much <br>Salaat, fast and Sadaqah to my credit, but I <br>do have in my heart the love of Allah and <br>that of His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\" <br>The Prophet:' \"On the Day of Judgement, you will surely <br>1 <br>be with'him whom you love.\" <br>i <br>What the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) told the <br>I <br>person in this story has also been narrated by several other <br>f <br>Sahabah, namely Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Abu Moosa<br>i <br>Ash'ari. Safwan. Abu Zar, (Radhiyallaho anhum) etc. <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Nothing did ever make Sahabah more happy than <br>these words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\" <br>They had every reason to be ha py when the love of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasa Plam) had gone deep <br>into every tissue and fibre of their body. <br>(3) In the beginning. Fatimah's (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>house was at some distance from the Prophet's. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to her: <br>I <br>I <br>\"Would that you were living near me.\" <br>Fatimah: <br>1 <br>\"Harithah's house is close by. If you ask him to ex- <br>change his house with mine. he will very gladly do it.\" <br>i <br>The Prophet: <br>\"He has already exchanged once on my request. I feel<br>I <br>shy to request him again.\" <br>1 <br><br>258 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>But Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) somehow came to know <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) likes Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) to live near him. He at once came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have come to know that you <br>wish Fatimah to live near you. Here are my houses at <br>your disposal. No other house is closer to yours than <br>these. Fatimah can have her house exchanged with any <br>of these. 0,Prophet of Allah, what you accept from me <br>is dearer to me than what you leave for me.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted the <br>offer, saying: <br>\"I know you are quite sincere in what you say\", and <br>gave him his blessings. <br>(4) A person came to the Prophet,[Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than my <br>life, my wealth and my family. When I am at my house <br>and happen to think of you, I become restless till I <br>come and see you. 0,Prophet of Allah, death ismre to <br>come to both of us. After death, you will be in your <br>exalted position as a Prophet, while I shall be some- <br>where else and perhaps I may not be able to see you. I <br>am very anxious and distressed when I think of this <br>separation from you.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this and he did not know what to say; then Jibra'eel <br>(Alayhis Salaam) appeared and revealed the following <br>verse: <br>\"Whoso obeyeth Allah and the Prophet, they are with <br>those unto whom Allah has shown favour among the <br>Prophets and the Saints and the Martyrs and the Right- <br>eous. The best of company are they. Such is the bounty <br>of Allah, and Allah. sufficeth, as knower. (IV: 69 & 70)\" <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>259 4 A<br>5%<br>These incidents were of frequent occurrence with the Saha- <br>bah. Such fears in the hearts of the lovers are quite natural. <br> fi <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited these <br>verses for their consolation. <br>A person once came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, my love for you is such that <br>when I think of you, I cannot rest till I run to see you, <br>for I am sure I would die if I did not see you. Now I <br>grow very anxious when I imagine that, even if I am <br>able to enter Paradise, it will be very difficult for me to <br>see you, for you will be in a position far above my <br>reach.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) consoled him by <br>reciting the foregoing verses in his reply. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw a person <br>from the Ansar looking very much distressed. He inquired: <br>\"What makes you look so distressed?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Alldh! I have a worry.\" <br>The Prophet: \"What is it?\" <br>The person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! We come to you every morning <br>and evening. We are blessed with your sight and de- <br>lighted to be in your presence. But one day, we will be <br>deprived of your company for you will be placed on <br>heights inaccessible to us.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this, but when the foregoing verses were revealed he <br>sent for that person and gave him the glad tidings con-<br>tained therein. <br>According to another Hadith, a number of Sahabah had <br>expressed similar fears until the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) rec,ited these verses to them, and they were satis- <br>fied. <br>According to another version, the Sahabah once asked <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"The Prophets on account of their ranks will surely be <br>in much higher position than their followers. How will <br>the followers be able to see them?\" <br><br>260 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>1<br>\"Those in higher positions will come down to their <br>friends in lower positions to sit with them and talk to <br>them.\" <br>I <br>(5)The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>t <br>i<br>\"Some of my followers coming after me will love me <br>1<br>very much. They will wish that they could see me, <br>even if they had to spend their wealth, forego their <br>i <br>families and sacrifice all their possessions for it.\" <br>i <br>! <br>Khalid's daughter Abdah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) says: <br>\"My father while in bed would talk about and remem- <br>ber the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with love <br>and eagerness for him. He would also remember each <br>and every M,uhajir and Ansari (by name) and would <br>say, \"They are my elders and they are my youngers. <br>My heart is eager to meet them. 0 ,  Allah! Call me back <br>l <br>soon, so that I may be able to meet all of them. He <br>would keep on doing this till he would be overtaken <br>by sleep.\" <br>(6) Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the <br>Prophet (Sallbllaho alaihe wasallam): <br>t <br>\"I have a greater wish for your uncle Abu Talib to <br>I <br>come into Islam than for my own father, as I know it <br>i <br>would please you more.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) similarly, once said to 'Abbas <br>(The prophet's uncle): <br>\"I was more pleased at your Islam that at that of my <br>father, for that gave pleasure to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam).\" <br>(7) One night, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was on his <br>security patrol when he saw a light and heard a sound <br>coming from a house. He peeped in to find an old lady <br>spinning wool and singing a few couplets with the follow- <br>ing meaning: <br>\"May Allah accept the prayers Of the pious and the <br>elect.\" <br>\"Seeking blessings for Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>261 s= <br>c. 0 <br>\"0.Allah's Prophet! You worshipped each night.

At the time of his death, his wife sat by his side ex- <br>claiming in excessive grief: <br>\"0,dear! Alas!\" <br>He retorted: \t \"Subhanallah! What a lovely thing it is to die <br>and be able to meet Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and his Sahabah.\" <br>(9) We have already read the story of Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in Chapter V While he stood at the gallows, <br>about to be executed, Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"How would you like it if Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) be killed in your place and you be let <br>off to enjoy life with your family.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"By Allah, it is unbearable for me to sit happily with <br>my family while (even) a thorn is pricking the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>On this, Abu Sufyan remarked: <br>\"There is no parallel anywhere in the world to the love <br>which the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) have for him.\" <br>A note: <br>What is expected of those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? The Ulama have <br>given various answers to this question. Qaadhi Iyaadh <br>writes: <br>\"A lover prefers his beloved above all other things and <br>persons. If this is not the case, the love is not sincere. It <br><br>262 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>is, therefore, essential for those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that they follow <br>him in his words and deeds, carry 'out his command- <br>ments, give up everything that he has disliked and <br>adopt his code of life (Sunnat) in ease and in adversity. <br>Allah has said in His holy book: <br>t <br>I <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>263 <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>Say (0, Prophet): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah <br>I <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is For- <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>giving, Merciful.\" (111: 31). <br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>The Epilogue. <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>The stories given in the previous pages are meant to <br>serve as specimens. In fact a detailed account of Sahabah's <br>lives can not be covered even in big volumes. It is now <br>quite a few months since I started writing this small book. <br>My engagements in Madrasah and other matters needing <br>immediate attention have already delayed this work. I, <br>therefore, propose to finish the book at this stage, so that <br>people may at least benefit from these pages. I have to write <br>an important warning before I close. Just as we are today <br>lacking in our other duties we owe to Islam, so are we very <br>seriously neglectful in our respect and esteem of the Saha- <br>bah. Some negligent people go to the extent of even making <br>adverse remarks against them, We must remember that the <br>Sahabah are those people who laid the foundations of <br>Islam. They are the pioneers in Tabligh. We can never be <br>too grateful to them. May Allah shower His choicest bles- <br>sings on their souls for their efforts in acquiring Islam from <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and handing it <br>down to their successors. I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>265 <br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation.

I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>said: <br>\"No body's wealth has benefited me so much as that of <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). I have com- <br>pensated everybody for the good done to me, except <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). He shall be <br>compensated by Allah Himself.\" <br>19. \t Hadhrat Asma '(Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending in <br>Charity. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the path of Allah. In the beginning, <br>she used to spend carefully with measure and weight. Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to her: <br>\"0,Asma, do not put by and be calculating; spend in <br>the path of Allah liberally.\" <br>After this, she started spending most generously. She <br>would advise her daughters and house maids: <br>\"Don't wait for any surplus or excess' of requirements <br>before spending in the path of Allah. As the require- <br>ments go on increasing in the chances of having some- <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>195 <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age. She came of age and then accepted Islam. She was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. Her husband <br>fought in Badr for Qureysh and fell a captive to the Mus- <br>lims. <br>When the Qureysh were paying ransom to secure re- <br>lease of their prisoners, Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) gave over as ransom for her husband the necklace <br>she had received in dowry from her mother Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha). When the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saw the necklace, the memories of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) came to his mind and <br>tears were in his eyes. After consultation with Sahabah, he <br>returned the necklace to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>ahna) and released her husband without ransom on the <br>condition that he would send Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) to Madinah on his return to Mecca. Two men <br>were sent to stay outside Mecca and bring Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) safely to Madinah, when she was <br>made over to them. Her husband asked his brother Kinanah <br>to take Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) outside Mecca <br>and make her over to the Muslim escort. As Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) and Kinanah were moving out <br>of the town on camel's back, the Qureysh sent a party to in- <br>tercept them.

Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave.

He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father. She, therefore, retorted: <br>\"No. I am the daughter of one who killed his slave.\" <br>Asma did not like this epithet for Abu Jahl, and said with <br>anger: <br>\"It is haram for me to sell perfume to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho hnha) said, in the same <br>strain, <br>\"It is haram for me to buy perfume from you. I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam.

Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>this marriage could not take place. Her first husband was <br>Atiq bin Aa'iz. She had a daughter from him, whose name <br>was Hind. H'nd grew up and embraced Islam, and she was <br>the mother o \\ many children. On the death of Atiq. Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Abu Halah and got <br>two children from him viz. Hind and Halah. Hind lived up <br>to the time of Ali's Caliphate. On the dzath of Abu Halah, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her as his <br>first wife. She died in Ramadhan of the 10th year of the <br>mission at the age df sixty-five. He loved her very much <br>and did not marry any other woman during her life time. <br>She was populprly called Tahirah (Clean and pure) even <br>before Islam. Her children from other husbands are there- <br>fore known as Banu Tahirah. Her virtues and privileges <br>have been mentioned extensively (in Hadith). The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) laid her in the grave with his <br>own hands. The funeral service had not till then been en- <br>joined. <br>(2)Hadhrat Sauda (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>L. <br>Hadhrat Sauda bint Zam'ah bin Qais (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was previously married to her cousin Hadhrat <br>Sukran bin 'Amor (Radhiyallaho anho). The couple em- <br>braced Islam and emigrated to Abysinnia. Hadhrat Sukran <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>favour of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), but I <br>don't like to be divorced (by you). I wish to be in Par- <br>adise as one of your wives.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to this <br>suggestion. She died in about 55 A.

As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave. This was all <br>for the instruction of his followers. (0,Allah! protect us <br>from the horrors of the grave by Thy special Favour. Grace <br>and Bounty). <br>I<br>*,+;C, & i;Chi;, r;611, <br>21. Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) High-minded- <br>ness: <br>Rubayyi-bint-Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha) was a <br>woman of Ansar, who had participated in many battles, by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>nursed the wounded and carried the dead bodies during <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>197 3<br>h= <br>0s <br>the battle. She had accepted Islam before the Prophet emi- <br>'G8 a <br>grated to Madinah. She was married when the Prophet was <br>~m <br>i \t<br>in Madinah. He graced her marriage with his presence. He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father. She, therefore, retorted: <br>\"No. I am the daughter of one who killed his slave.\" <br>Asma did not like this epithet for Abu Jahl, and said with <br>anger: <br>\"It is haram for me to sell perfume to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho hnha) said, in the same <br>strain, <br>\"It is haram for me to buy perfume from you. I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam. She could <br>not tolerate an enemy of Islam being mentioned as a chief. <br>We hear from the lips of Muslims most flowery and high <br><br>198 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Ch.

Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>this marriage could not take place. Her first husband was <br>Atiq bin Aa'iz. She had a daughter from him, whose name <br>was Hind. H'nd grew up and embraced Islam, and she was <br>the mother o \\ many children. On the death of Atiq. Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Abu Halah and got <br>two children from him viz. Hind and Halah. Hind lived up <br>to the time of Ali's Caliphate. On the dzath of Abu Halah, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her as his <br>first wife. She died in Ramadhan of the 10th year of the <br>mission at the age df sixty-five. He loved her very much <br>and did not marry any other woman during her life time. <br>She was populprly called Tahirah (Clean and pure) even <br>before Islam. Her children from other husbands are there- <br>fore known as Banu Tahirah. Her virtues and privileges <br>have been mentioned extensively (in Hadith). The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) laid her in the grave with his <br>own hands. The funeral service had not till then been en- <br>joined. <br>(2)Hadhrat Sauda (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>L. <br>Hadhrat Sauda bint Zam'ah bin Qais (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was previously married to her cousin Hadhrat <br>Sukran bin 'Amor (Radhiyallaho anho). The couple em- <br>braced Islam and emigrated to Abysinnia. Hadhrat Sukran <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>favour of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), but I <br>don't like to be divorced (by you). I wish to be in Par- <br>adise as one of your wives.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to this <br>suggestion. She died in about 55 A. H. towards the end of <br>the Khilafat of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>There was another Qureysh woman of the same name. <br>She was also a widow having about six children. The <br>Prophet offered to marry her, but she said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than any <br>other person in this world. I do not like my children to <br>be a nuisance to you.\" <br>He appreciated this, and withdrew the offer. <br>(3)Hadhrat A.ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) too was married <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in Swawwal of <br>the 10th year of the Nubuwwat. She was born in the 4th <br>year of Nubuwwat and was married when she was six, but <br>was actually sent by her parents to live with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) after his emigration to Madi- <br>nah, when she was nine.

She was the only wife of the Prophet who had not <br>been married previously. All the remaining wives had <br>either been widowed or divorced (some quite a few times) <br>before they became Ummuhat-ul-Momineen. To be married <br>in Shawwal was considered a bad omen among the Arab <br>women. Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was married in Shawwal.

You may make the proposal.\" <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anha) then went to <br>Hadhrat Aisha (Radhiyallaho anha's) mother Hadhrat <br>Umme-Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha) and said to her: <br>C <br>\"I have come with good tidings for your family.\" <br>Ch.

When he came, the proposal was placed <br>before him, and he expressed the same difficulty. Hadhrat <br>Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and apprised him of their diffi- <br>culty. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Abu Bakr is my bosom friend and brother-in-Islam, <br>but this does not forbid my marrying his daughter.\" <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and informed <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) accordingly. Abu <br>Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho) was extremely glad to call the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to his home and per- <br>form Aishah's (Radhiyallaho anha) Nikah with him. A few <br>months later, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had emigrated to Madinah, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) said to the Prophet: <br>\"Why don't you have your wife Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to live with you?\" <br>He said: \"I have to make some preparations, etc., before I <br>do that.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) presented him with <br>some money, with which necessary things were arranged. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anho) then started living <br>with the Prophet from Shawwal of 1 or 2 A.

She was first married to Hadhrat Khunais bin <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho), who was one of the very <br>early Muslims. He first emigrated to Abyssinia and then to <br>Madinah. He participated in Badr, and was fatally <br>wounded in Badr (or in Uhud) and died of the wound in <br>the year 1 or 2 A. H. Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had also emigrated to Madinah with her husband.

Meanwhile Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) the <br>daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and <br>the wife of 'Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) died. <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat <br>Usman (Radhiyailaho anho) and offered Hadhrat Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho's) hand to him.

Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) later said to 'Hadhrat 'Usman Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>I <br>\"When you offered Hafsah's hand to me, I kept quiet as <br>the Prophet had expressed to me his intention of mar- <br>rying her.

If <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had changed <br>his mind, I would have gladly married her.\" <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abu Bakr's silence over the offer was in fact more <br>shocking to me than 'Usman's rejection.\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha) was a very pious <br>woman, and very much devoted to Salaat. She would often <br>fast during the day and spend the night in prayers. Once <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>203 <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), for some reason, <br>was displeased with Hafsah and even pronounced the first <br>divorce to her. 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was na- <br>turally very much shocked over this. Jibra-eel Alayhis came <br>to the Prophet (Sallal Salaam laho alaihe wasallam) and <br>said: <br>\"Allah wants you to take Hafsah back, as she is fasting <br>often and spending her nights in Salaat, and also Allah <br>wants it for Hadhrat Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>sake.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) therefore <br>took her back. She died in Jamadil oola, 45 A. H., at the age <br>of 63. <br>(5) Hadhrat Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was the next to be <br>married to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). There <br>are divergent reports about her previous husbands. Accord- <br>ing to one report, she was first married to Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) who was killed in Uhud, <br>as we have already seen in his story in chapter VI1. Accord-<br>ing to another report, she was first married to Tufail ibnul <br>a1 Harith and when divorced by him was remarried to <br>his brother Ubaidah ibnul Harith, who was killed in Badr. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her in <br>Ramadhan, 3 A. H. She lived with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) for eight months only, as she died in <br>Rabi-ul-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Zainab and Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) are the two wives of the <br>Prophet who died during his life time. All the other wives <br>lived on after him and died later. Hadhrat Zainab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) spent very liberally on the poor, and was <br>known as 'Ummul Masakin' (mother of the poor) even <br>before Islam. <br>After her death, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) married Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>(6) Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Ummayvah. <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). She was first married to her cousin <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdul Asad known as Abu Salamah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). The couple embraced Islam in the <br>very beginning and emigrated to Abyssinia, due to the per- <br><br>204 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>secutions of Qureysh. A son was born to them in exile, who <br>was named Salamah. After returning from Abyssinia, the <br>family emigrated to Madinah. Hadhrat Umme Salamah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) story about her journey to Madinah <br>has been already given in the early part of the chapter. <br>After reaching Madinah, Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) got another son 'Umar and two daughters, <br>Durrah and Zainab (Radhiyallaho anhum). Hadhrat Abu <br>Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) was the eleventh man to em- <br>brace Islam. He participated in the battle of Badr as well as <br>in Uhud. He got a severe wound in Uhud, which did not <br>heal for a long time. He was sent by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in an expedition in Safar, 4 A. H. When <br>he returned from the expedition, the old wound again <br>started giving trouble and at last he died of the same on 8th <br>Jamadil-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was pregnant at the time. Zainab was born to <br>her after the death of her husband. After she had completed <br>her Iddat (waiting period), Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) proposed to marry her, but she declined. <br>Later, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) offered <br>to marry her. She said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have quite a few children with <br>me and I am very sensitive by nature. Moreover, all my <br>people are in Mecca, and their permission for getting <br>remarried is necessary.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Allah will look after your children and your sensi- <br>tiveness will vanish in due course. None of your <br>people will dislige the proposed marriage\". <br>She then asked her (eldest) son Hadhrat Salamah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to serve as her guardian and give her in <br>marriage to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was married in the end of Shawwal, 4 A. H. <br>She says: \t \"I had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that a person struck with a calamity <br>should recite this prayer: <br>\"0,Allah!

Once I contrived to see her. I found her <br>much more beautiful than I had heard. I mentioned <br>this to Hafsah who said. \"In my opinion, she is not as <br>beautiful as people say.\" <br>She was the last of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam's) wives to die. It was in 59 or 62 A. H. She was 84 at <br>the time of her death, and as, such she was born 9 years <br>1 <br>before Nubuwwat. <br>As has already been said, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) married her after the death of Hadhrat <br>Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha). She therefore <br>lived in Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha's) house. She <br>found a hand-mill, a kettle and some barley in an earthen <br>jar, lying in the house. She milled some barley and after <br>putting some fat cooked a preparation, which she served to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on the very first <br>day of her marriage with him. <br>(7) Hadhrat Zainab bint Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) <br>i <br>cousin. She was first given in marriage by the Prophet (Sal- <br>I <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) to his adopted son Hadhrat Zaid <br>I <br>bin Hari thah (Radhiyallaho anho). When Hadhrat Zaid <br>i <br>(~adhi~allaho<br>anho) divorced her, she was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by command of Allah, <br>1 <br>1 \t<br>as mentioned in Soorah A1 Ahzab. This took place in 5 A. <br>I \t<br>H; at that time, she was 35. She w 2s therefore born 17 years<br>before Nabuwat. She was always proud of the fact that, <br>while all the other wives were given in marriage to the <br>Prophet by their guardians, it was Allah Himself Who did <br>this for her. When Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) div- <br>orced her and she had completed her Iddat, the Prophet <br>t \t<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sent the proposal to her. She <br>said: <br>\"I cannot \t say anything until I have consulted my <br><br>206 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Allah.\" She performed Wudhu, said two rakaat of Salaat, <br>and prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy Prophet proposes to marry me. If I am <br>fit for the honour, then give me in his marriage.\" <br>Allah answered her prayer by revealing the following verse <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed the necessary formality <br>(of release) from them. The Commandment of Allah <br>must be fulfilled.\" <br>(XXXIII:37) <br>When she received the good news about this revel- <br>ation, she prostrated before Allah in thanksgiving. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) arranged a big feast of <br>Walimah for this marriage. A goat was slaughtered and <br>mutton-curry with bread was served to the guests. People <br>came in groups, and were served till all of them were fed. <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the way of Allah. She earned by <br>working with her hands and spent all her earnings in <br>charity. It was about,her that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prophesied: <br>\"My wife with long hands will be the first to meet me <br>after my death.\" <br>The wives took this to mean the physical length of arms <br>and began to measure their hands with a stick. The hands <br>of Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha) came out to be the <br>longest by measurement. But when Hadhrat Zainab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) died first, the meaning of the metaphor <br>used by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dawned <br>upon them. She fasted very often. She died in 20 A. H.and <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) led the funeral service. She was <br>fifty at the time of her death. <br>(8) Hadhrat Juwairiah bintul Harith (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6 Spirit for Islam <br>207<br>114 <br>Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the daugh- <br>/ <br>ter of Harith, the chief of Banu Mustaliq and was married <br>to Musafe' bin Safwan. <br>She was one of the large number of captives who fell <br>! \t<br>into Muslim hands after the battle of Muraisee', and she <br>was given to Hadhrat Thabit bin Qais (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He offered to release her for 360 Dirhams. She came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am the daughter of Harith who <br>is the chief of the tribe, and you know my story. The <br>ransom demanded by Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is too much for me. I have come to seek your <br>help in the matter.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to pay her <br>ransom, set her free, and offered to take her as his wife. She <br>was very glad to accept this offer. She was married to the <br>Prophet in 5 A. H. and as a consequence of this marriage, <br>the prisoners of Banu Mustaliq (Juwairiah's tribe), about a <br>hundred families, were all set free by the Muslims. \"The <br>tribe which was so honoured by the Prophet's relation- <br>ship,\" they said, \"should not remain in slavery.\" <br>Such were the noble expediences in all the marriages <br>of the Prophet. Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>very pretty, her face was very attractive. Three days before <br>her falling captive in the battle, she had seen in her dream <br>the moon coming out from Madinah and falling into her <br>lap. She says: <br>\"When I was captured, I began to hope that my dream <br>would come true.\" <br>She was 20 at the time of her marriage with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She died in Rabi-ul-Awwal, <br>50 A. H., in Madinah at the age of 65. <br>, <br>(9) Hadhrat Umme Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Abu Sufyan, and was first <br>married to Ubaidullah bin Jahsh in Mecca. The couple em- <br>braced Islam, and then emigrated to Abyssinia due to per- <br>secution by the Qureysh. One night she saw her husband <br>(in a dream) in the most ugly and obnoxious form. The next <br>day she came to know that he had turned Christian. She, <br>however, remained a Muslim and was therefore separated <br>from him. She was now all alone in exile. But Allah soon <br><br></p></div>"

The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) sent her an offer of marriage through the King <br>Negus, who sent a woman named Abrahah to her with the <br>message. She was so happy with the good news that she <br>made over the bracelets and other jewellery that she was <br>wearing to the woman in gratification. King Negrls rep- <br>resented the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the <br>Nikah ceremony, and gave her 400 dinars as her portion <br>and many other things in dowry from himself. He also gave <br>a feast and dinars as gift to all those who were present in <br>the ceremony. The Negus then despatched her to Madinah <br>with her dowry and other gifts such as perfume, etc. This <br>marriage took place in 7 A. H. (Her father was not a Muslim <br>then). She most probably died in 44 A. H. <br>(10) Hadhrat Safiyyah (Kadhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Hayi, who was a descendant <br>of Hadhrat Harun (Alaihis salaam) the brother of Hadhrat <br>Moosa (Alaihis salaam). She was first married to Salam bin <br>Mishkam and then to Kinanah bin Abi Huqaiq at the time <br>of Kheybar. Kinanah was killed in the battle and she was <br>captured by the Muslims. Hadhrat Dahya Kalbi (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) requested for a maid, and the Prophet made her <br>over to him. At this, the other Sahabah approached the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Banu Nazir and Banu Quraizah <br>(the Jewish tribes of Madinah) will feel offended to see <br>the daughter of a Jewish chief working as a maid. We <br>therefore suggest that she may be taken as your own <br>wife.\" <br>I <br>The Prophet paid a reasonable sum of money to Hadhrat <br>Dahya (Radhiyallaho anho) as ransom, and said to Sa-<br>fiyyah: <br>\"You are now free: if you like you can go back to your <br>tribe or can be my wife.\" <br>She said: \t \"I longed to be with you while I was a Jew. How <br>can I leave you now, when I am a Muslim?\" <br>This is probably a reference to the fact that she once saw in <br>-her dream a portion of the moon falling into her lap. When <br>she mentioned her dream to Kinanah, he smote her face. so <br>severely that she developed a mark on her eye. He said: <br>\"You seem to be desiring to become the wife of the <br>King of Madinah.\" <br>Her father is also reported to have treated her similarly <br>when she related the same or similar dream to him. She <br>again saw (in her dream) the sun lying on her breast. When <br>she mentioned this to her husband, he remarked: <br>\"You seem to be wishing to become the Queen of Mad- <br>inah.\" <br>She says: \t \"I was seventeen when I was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>She came to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) when he was camping at the first stage from <br>Khaiber. Next morning, he said to the Sahabah: <br>\"Let everybody bring whatever he has got to eat.'' <br>They brought their own dates, cheese, butter, etc. A long <br>leather sheet was spread and all sat round it to share the <br>food among themselves. This was the Walimah for the mar- <br>riage. <br>She died in Ramadhan, 50 A. H., when she was about <br>60. <br>(II )  Hadhrat Maimoonah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Harith bin Hazan. Her original <br>name was Barrah, but she was later renamed Maimoonah <br>by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She was first <br>married to Abu Rahm bin Abdul Uzza. According to some <br>reports, she was married twice before she became Ummul <br>Mominin. She had been widowed lately when the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her at Saraf, a place <br>lying on his journey to Mecca for 'Umrah in Zul Qa'dah 7 <br>A. H. He had intended to start living with her when in <br>Mecca after performing 'Umrah but, as Qureysh did not <br>allow him to enter Mecca, he called her over to him in the <br>same place on his return journey. Many years later she died <br>and was buried exactly at the same place in 51 A. H. (when <br>she was 81). This is a strange coincidence that at a certain <br>place during one journey she is married, at the same place <br>on the return journey she starts living with the Prophet. <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and at the very place during <br>another journey she dies and is buried. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (RAdhiyallaho anha) savs: <br><br>210 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Maimoonah was the most pious, and the most mind- <br>ful of her kith and kin, among the Prophet's wives.\" <br>Hadhrat Yazid bin Asam (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"She was seen either engaged in Salat or in domestic <br>work. When she was doing neither, she was busy in <br>Miswak.\" <br>She was the last woman to be married by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Certain Muhaddithin have, how- <br>ever, mentioned one or two other marriages contracted by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Appendix: <br>The Sons of The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had three <br>sons and four daughters. All the children were born from <br>Hadhrat Khadija (Radhivallaho anha), except the son Ibra- <br>him. Qasim was his first son, born to him before Nubuw- <br>wat. He died when he was two. Abdullah, the second son, <br>was born after Nubuwwat. He was, hence, called Tayyab <br>and Taahir. He also died in his childhood. At the time of <br>his death, the Qureysh rejoiced and said: <br>\"Muhammad is without a son, and will therefore be <br>without posterity. His name will also die out with his <br>death.\" <br>It was on this occasion that Soorah Al-Kauthar was re-<br>vealed by Allah. It said: <br>\"Lo! We have given thee Abundance. So pray unto thy <br>Lord, and sacrifice. Lo! it is thy detractor (not thou) <br>(XVIII:1to 3)<br>who is without posterity.\" <br>Even after more than thirteen hundred years, tci :v there <br>are millions who are proud to be connected to him in love <br>and devotion. <br>Ibrahim, the third son and last child, was born in Mad- <br>inah in 8 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) <br>wonla11 slave Mariah begot this for him. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) performed the Aqiqah ceremorly <br>Ch. X: Women's C o u ~ g e  <br>b Spirit for Islam <br>211 <br>on the seventh day of his birth. Two lambs were slaugh- <br>tered, the child's head was shaved by Hadhrat Abu Hind <br>Bayazi (Radhiyallaho anho), silver equal in weight to his <br>hair was spent in charity, and the hair was buried. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I am naming my child after the name of my forefather <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam).\" <br>This son also died, on 10th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, 10 A. Ii., <br>when he was only 18 months old. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) then remarked: <br>\"Allah has appointed a heavenly nurse to tend to Ibra- <br>hirn in the gardens of Paradise.\" <br>The Daughters of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>(1)Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the eldest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and was born in the fifth year of his first <br>marriage, when he was thirty. She embraced Islam and was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. The story of her <br>emigration to Madinah and her getting wounded by the Qu- <br>reysh has already been given in the early part of this chap- <br>ter. She suffered long from that wound, and at last died of <br>it in the beginning of 8 A. H. Her husband also embraced <br>Islam later and joined her in Madinah. She had a son Ali <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). and a daughter Amamah. Ali died <br>during the life time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). This same Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) was the person <br>who sat with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on <br>the camel's back at the time of his triumphal entry into <br>Mecca. We read frequently in Hadith about a little girl <br>riding on the back of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) as he prostrated in Salaat; this was Amamah, Zainab's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) daughter. She lived long after the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) married her on the death of Fatima (Rad- <br>hivallaho anha)-his first wife. It is said that Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) at the time of her death had expressed <br>a desire for this union. She had no issue from Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho). After Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>death she was again married to Hadhrat Mughirah bin <br>Naufal (Radhiyallaho anho), from whom she probably got <br>one son named Yahya. She died in 50 A. H. <br><br>212 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(2)Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was born three years after the birth of Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha), when the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was 33. She was married to Utbah, son of <br>Abu Lahab, the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>uncle, but had not yet started living with him when Soorah <br>Al-Lahab was revealed. Abu Lahab called his sons Utbah <br>and Utaibah (to whom Umme Kulsum, another daughter of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam) was married), <br>and said to them: <br>\"Unless you both divorce the daughters of Muham-<br>mad, I am not going to see your faces.\" <br>They divorced their wives. Later, upon the fall of Mecca, <br>Utbah embraced Islam. Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) after this divorce was married to Hadhrat 'Usman <br>(Radhivallaho anho). The couple emigrated to Abyssinia <br>twice. as we have already seen in chapter I. <br>Since the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had an- <br>nounced to the Sahabah that he was expecting to receive <br>Allah's command for emigration to Madinah any time, they <br>started shifting to Madinah even before the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallahoalaihe wassallam) Hijrat. Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyal- <br>Laho anho) and Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) had <br>also emigrated to Madinah before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) arrived in the town. At the time of Badr, <br>Ruqa!lvah was ill (she died subsequently of this illness). <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was, therefore, asked by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to stay in Madinah <br>and look after her. The news about the victory in Badr was <br>received in Madinah when people were returning from Ru- <br>qayyah's funeral. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was, therefore, not present at her burial. <br>A son was born to Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) in Abvssinia. He was named Abdullah and survived <br>his mother. but died in 4 A. H. when he was six years old. <br>(3)Hadhrat U~nme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She is the third daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). She was married to Utaibah son of Abu <br>Lahab, but had not yet started living with him when Utai- <br>bah divorced her after the revelation of Soorah Al-Lahab, as <br>has already been mentioned. After divorcing her, Utaibah <br>Ch. X:Women's Courage 6.Spirit for Islam <br>213 g4 <br>$.p <br>came to the Prophet (~allall'aho alaihe wasallam) and used <br>most insolent words to him. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe $4 <br>g m<br>wasallam) cursed him by praying: <br>\"0, Allah! depute one of Thy dogs to punish him.\" <br>Abu Talib, who had also not embraced Islam, was alarmed <br>at the curse and said to Utaibah: <br>\"YOU have no way out now.\" <br>Once Utaibah was accompanying Abu Lahab in a caravan <br>going to Syria. Abu Lahab; in spite of his disbelief, said to <br>the people: <br>\"I am afraid of Muhammad's curse. Everybody should <br>be very careful of my son.\" <br>They happened to camp at a place which was inhabited by <br>lions. The people piled up all their luggage and Utaibah <br>was made to sleep on top of the pile, while the rest of the <br>people slept around the pile. A lion came at night; it smelt <br>all the people sleeping round the pile. Then it jumped over <br>the people and reached Utaibah. He gave out a shriek, but <br>meanwhile the lion had severed his head from his body. It <br>is very necessary that we avoid, offending the eople dear <br>to Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal am) has re- <br>P <br>ported Allah as saying: <br>\"I give a challenge of war to one who offends My <br>friends.\" <br>After the death of Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiallaho <br>anha), Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>also married to Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>Rabi-ul-Awwal, 3 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said: <br>\"I have given Umme Kulsum in marriage to Usman by <br>Allah's command.\" <br>She died issueless in Shaaban, 9 A. H. After herdeath, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have re- <br>marked: <br>\"Even if I had one hundred daughters, I would have <br>given all of them in marriage to 'Usman (one after the <br>other), if each one had died.\" <br><br>214 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(4)Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) the fourth and <br>the youngest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), and the \"head of the ladies in Paradise\" was born <br>in the 1st year of Nubuwwat, when he was 41. It is said <br>that the name Fatimah (lit: safe from fire) was revealed by <br>Allah. She was married to Ali (Radhiyallaho,anho) in 2 A. <br>H. and she began to live with him seven and a half months <br>later. She was about fifteen and Ali was 21 at the time of <br>their union. Of all the daughters, she was the most loved by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); whenever he <br>went out on a journey, she was the last one to part with <br>and when he returned home she was the first one to meet <br>him. When Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) intended to marry Abu <br>Jahal's daughter, she was very much grieved and expressed <br>her grief to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Fatimah is a part of my body. Whoever grieves her, <br>grieves me. \" <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) gave up the idea of the second <br>marriage during her life time. After her death, he married <br>her niece Amamah (Radhiyallaho anha), as we have <br>already seen in the previous pages. <br>1 <br>It was about six months after the death of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that Fatimah fell ill. One day, <br>she said to her maid: <br>\"I want to takep bath. Arrange some water for me.\" <br>She took a bath and changed her clothes. She then desired <br>her bed to be placed in the middle of the room. She laid <br>herself down on the bedding, with her face towards Qiblah, <br>and her right hand under her right cheek, and said: <br>\"I am now going to die.\" <br>The next moment she was no more. The Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) progeny continued and shall con- <br>tinue (inshallah) through her children. She had three sons <br>and three daughters. Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hus- <br>sain (Radhiyallaho anho) were born in the second and the <br>third year after the marriage, respectively. Muhassan (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the third son, was born in 4 A. H.,.but <br>died in childhood. <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6.Spirit for lslam <br>215 <br>Ruqayyah, her first daughter, died in infancy and has, <br>therefore, not been mentioned much in history. Her second <br>daughter Umme Kulsum was first married to Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), begetting one son Zaid and one <br>daughter Hadhrat Ruqayyah. On Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho's) death, Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho <br>anhaj was married to Aun bin Ja'far, but had no issue from <br>him. After his death, his brother Muhammad bin Ja'far mar- <br>ried her. A daughter was born to them, who died in child- <br>hood Even Muhammad (Radhiyallaho anho) died in her <br>lifetime and she was again married to the third brother, <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho), from whom she <br>had no issue. She died as Abdullah's wife. Her son Zaid <br>also died the same day, and both were carried for burial at <br>the same time. Abdullah, 'Aun and Muhammad (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum) have already been mentioned as sons of Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and nephews of Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in chapter VI. <br>Zainab, Hadhrat Fatima's (Radhiyallaho anha) third <br>daughter, was married to Abdullah bin Ja'far and had two <br>sons Abdullah and Aun from him. It was after her death <br>that he married her sister Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>many other children from his wives after Fatimah. It is <br>stated that he had as many as thirty-two issues. Hasan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had fifteen sons and eight daughters, <br>while Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was the father of six <br>sons and three daughters. <br><br>217 <br>CHAPTER XI <br>THE CHILDREN-THEIR DEVOTION TO ISLAM <br>The true spirit of Islam that we find in the children of <br>Sahabah's time was the fruit of the upbringing which they <br>received at the hands of their parents. The parents and <br>guardians of our times spoil the children by over fondling <br>them. If, instead, they inculcated in their young hearts the <br>importance of Islamic practices, these could easily become <br>their habits when they grow up. When we see a child doing <br>something undesirable, we simply brush it off by saying, <br>'He is but a child.' We have seen some parents even feeling <br>happy over their darling (child) having sufficient grown up <br>to do such unseemly things. We deceive ourselves when <br>we say, on seeing a child doing something un-Islamic, that <br>he will be all right when he grows up. <br>How can a bad seed grow up into a good plant? If you <br>really wish your child to be a good Muslim when he is <br>grown up, you have to sow the seed of Iman and Islam in <br>his heart right from his childhood. The Sahabah were very <br>particular about training their children in Islamic practices. <br>and they kept a watchful eye on their doings. <br>In Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) time, a person <br>was arrested by the police for drinking in Ramadhan. When <br>he was brought before Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>he said to him: <br>t <br>\"Woe to you! Even our children are keeping fast in this <br>month.\" <br>He was punished with eighty lashes and was banished <br>from Madinah for ever. <br>1. \t Children keep fast. <br>Hadhrat Rubbayi' bint Mu'awwaz (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>(who was mentioned in the last chapter) says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined on us to fast on the 10th of Muharram. Since <br>then we have always been fasting on that day. Even the <br>children were made to fast with us. When they cried <br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>out in hunger, we diverted them with toys made of <br>cotton flakes till the time of Iftaar.\" <br>We learn from Hadith that the nursing mothers of <br>those days would not feed their infants during the fast.

Notwith- <br>standing her age. she is responsible for innunlerable Aha- <br>diths and regulations of <br>Islanlic practices.

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br><br>FOREWORD <br>11<br>10 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>Allaho akbar!

'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br><br>15 <br>14 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>1 <br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br><br>16 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>I <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>I <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>t <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br><br>18 <br>19 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br><br></p></div>"

I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>17 / <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br><br>18 <br>19 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br><br>20 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br><br>0 <br>22 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of ~ a r d s h i ~ s  23 <br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br><br>24 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br><br></p></div>"

Sit down.\" <br>m<br>S m  <br>He enquired for the third time: <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) was six <br>when he lost his father. He was eleven at the time of <br>Hijrah.<br>\"Who will be the third nian to guard mv tent. tonight'!\" <br>Again came a voice from the crowd: <br>\"I. 0 Prophet of Allah!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Your name?\" <br>The voice: <br>\"Ibn Abdulqais (son of Abdul Qais).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"All right. You also sit down.\" <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bade all the <br>three volurlteers to colne to him. Only one person came for- <br>ward. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Where are your other two comrades'?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! It was I who stood up all the <br>three times. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) blessed him with <br>his pravers. and allowed him to guard his tent. He kept <br>watching the tent all night long. <br>Just look! How eager the Sahabah were to face death <br>for the sake of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The children and adults. young and old, men and <br>women. all were intoxicated with the same spirit of sacri- <br>fice and devotion. <br>Rafb bin Khudaij had offered to fight in Badr too, but <br>he was not permitted. 111 Uhud. however, he was allowed <br>to fight for the first time. Since then, he had bee11 partici- <br>pating in almost all the campaigns. In Uhud the enemy's <br>arrow struck him in his chest. When it was drawn but, a <br>small remnant remained inside his bodv. This caused a <br>wound. whic;li eventually proved fatal in his old age. <br>He offered himself for the battle of Badr, but was re- <br>jected on account of his tender age. He again volunteered <br>for Uhud. This time also he was not permitted, as we saw <br>in the last story. He had since then been participating in all <br>the campaigns. While the Mujahidin were marching to- <br>wards Tabuk, the flag of Banu Malik clan was held by Am- <br>marah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bade him <br>make over the flag to Zaid. Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>thought that perhaps somebody had made a complaint <br>against him, which had displeased the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He therefore said: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Is it due to somebody com-<br>plaining against me?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. But Zaid knows more Qur'an than you do. His <br>Qur'an has given him preference.\" <br>It was common with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that he gave preference to the people in accordance <br>with their virtues. Although this was an occasion of battle. <br>and a knowledge of the Qur'an had no direct bearing on the <br>issue, yet the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave <br>preference to Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) for his Qur'an. This <br>distinction we find on other occasions as well. When a <br>number of dead persons had to be accommodated in one <br>grave (as in Uhud), they were buried in the order of their <br>knowledge of the Qur'an, priority being given to those who <br>knew more of it. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri's (Radhiyallaho anhoj Re- <br>straint. <br>Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"I was <br>presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by <br>my father for fighting at Uhud, when I was thirteen. My <br>father recommended me saying: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah! He has a very good body. His <br>bones are very well-developed.\" <br><br>224 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>16 <br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>225 <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) looked at me <br>again and again, and finally rejected me due to my young <br>age. My father, however, participated in the battle and was <br>killed. He left me nothing to live on. I went to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to seek some financial help <br>from him. Before I could express myself, he addressed me <br>saying: <br>'Abu Saeed! Whoso seeks endurance from Allah! gets <br>it; Whoso seeks chastity from Him, gets it; And whoso <br>seeks contentment from Him will surely get it.' <br>After hearing this, I returned home without making any re- <br>quest to him. On this, Allah blessed him with such an <br>exalted position that, among the younger Sahabah, there is <br>nobody endowed with so much knowledge and learning as <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Look at the restraint of Abu Sa'eed at such a young age. <br>As we know, in Uhud he had lost his father who had left <br>him nothing to live on and therefore he fully deserved all <br>help; yet a few words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) stopped him from talking of his distress and seek- <br>ing a favour. Can a person much older than him show such <br>a strength of character? In fact, the persons selected by <br>Allah for the company of his dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) did really deserve that honour. That is <br>why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"Allah has preferred my conlpanions over all other <br>men.\" <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Salmih bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>faces the Bandits. <br>Ghabah was a small village at four or five miles from <br>Madinah. The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>camels were sent to that place for grazing. Abdur Rahman <br>Fazari, with the help of a few disbelievers, killed the <br>person looking after the camels and took them away. The <br>bandits were riding their horses, and all of them were <br>armed. Salmah bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) was going <br>on foot in the morning with his bow and arrows, when he <br>happened to see the bandits. He was only a boy but he ran <br>very fast. It is said that he could beat the fastest horse in <br>race. He was also a very good archer. No sooner did he see <br>the bandits than he climbed up a hill and shouted towards <br>Madinah to raise an alarm. He then chased the bandits and, <br>on approaching near them, started sending arrows one after <br>the other. He did this so swiftly and incessantly that the <br>bandits thought they were being chased by a large number <br>of people. If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow. The bandits at once retreated at <br>full speed to escape from being captured. Salmah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I kept on chasing the bandits till all the camels taken <br>away by them were behind me. Besides, in their flight <br>they left behind 30 spears and 30 sheets of cloth of <br>their own. Meanwhile, Uyainah bin Hisn (another <br>bandit) and his party arrived on the scene to reinforce <br>the bandits. They had meanwhile come to know that I <br>was all alone. They now chased me in large concentra- <br>tion and I was compelled to climb up a hill. As they <br>were about to approach me I shouted, 'Stop. First <br>listen to me. Do you know who am I? I am Ibnul <br>Akwah. By Him who has given glory to Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), if anyone of you chases <br>me. he cannot catch me. On the other hand, if I run <br>after any of you he cannot escape me.' I kept on talking <br>to them in that strain to beguile them till, I thought. <br>help would reach me from Madinah. I looked anx-<br>iously through the trees, as I talked to them when at <br>last, I noticed a group of riders headed by Akhram <br>Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) coming towards me. As <br>Akhram approached the bandits, he attacked Abdur <br>Rahman and cut one leg of his horse. Abdur Rahman, <br>as he fell down from the horse, attacked Akhram and <br>killed him. Abu Qatadah (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>meanwhile arrived. In the combat that ensued. Abdur <br>Rahman lost his life and Abu Qatadah his horse.\" <br>It is written in some books of history that, when <br>Akhram was going to attack Abdur Rahman, Salmah ad- <br>vised him to wait till the rest of his people had joined him. <br>But he did not wait. saying: <br>\"I wish to die as a martyr in the path of Allah.\" <br>He was the only person killed from among the Muslims. <br>The bandits lost a good number of their men. The11 more <br>reinforcement reached the Muslims, and the bandits took <br>to their heels. Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) sought the <br><br></p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br>0,<br>13 <br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br><br></p></div>"

Let me have one hundred men, I <br>shall teach them a lesson.\" <br>But the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. They would have by now reached their bases.\" <br>Most of the historians say that Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was hardly 12 or 13 at that time. Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them. This was the outcome of Iman and <br>Ikhlas, with which Allah had imbued the hearts of those <br>blessed people. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Bara's (Radhiyallaho anho) eagerness to Join <br>in Badr. <br>Badr was the most gallant and illustrious battle ever <br>fought by the Muslims, who were faced with very heavy <br>odds. There were 313 men, 3 horses, seventy camels, six or <br>nine coats of arms and eight swords with the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), while the Qureysh had about <br>1000 men, 100 horses, 700 camels, and were armed to their <br>teeth. The Qureysh were so sure of their victory that they <br>had brought with them musical instruments and song-<br>stresses to celebrate the victory. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was very anxious because of the heavy <br>odds against him. Heprayed to Allah saying: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy faithful slaves are barefooted; Thou and <br>only Thou can provide them with animals to ride <br>upon. They are naked; Thou and only Thou can clothe <br>them. They are poor; Thou and only Thou can sustain <br>them.\" <br>Allah granted his prayer and gave the most glorious victory <br>to the Muslims. <br>In spite of knowing the strength of the Qureysh, Ab- <br>dullah bin 'Umar and Bara bin Azib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), in eagerness to join the battle, had come out with <br>the Mujahidin. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>however, in consideration of their tender age, did not <br>permit them to proceed to the battle-field. <br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>As we have already seen, both these boys were also re- <br>jected for the same reason at the time of Uhud, which took <br>place one year after Badr. Look at the wonderful spirit of <br>the youngsters of that time that they were anxious to obtain <br>permission for participating in every battle. <br>11. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus: <br>\"All this is the outcome of the seed that you people <br>have sown with your own hands. You provided refuge <br>to these strangers (meaning Muhajirin) in your town <br>and shared your wealth equally with them. If you <br>withdraw your help from them, they will be obliged to <br>go back.\" <br>He further said: <br>\"By Allah! On return to Madinah, we, the respected <br>people, shall drive out these mean people from there.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho), an Ansari <br>boy was listening to him. He could not tolerate these words <br>and at once retorted by saying to him: <br>\"By Allah! You yourself are wretched. Even your own <br>people look down upon you, and nobody will support <br>you. Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>honoured. He is exalted by Rahman and revered by his <br>followers.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ubayy said: <br>\"All right. Do not mention it to anybody. It was only a <br>jest; I was not serious in w h t  I said.\" <br><br>228 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>statement and took no action against him. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know that the Munafiq had suc- <br>ceeded in , beguiling the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through false oaths, he would not come out for <br>shame of being considered a liar by the people. He would <br>not even go to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At <br>last, Allah revealed Soorah A1 Munafiqoon, in which the <br>report of Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was confirmed and the <br>Munafiq was exposed. After this, all people began to <br>honour Zaid and look down upon the Munafiq. <br>Now the Munafiq (Abdullah bin Ubayy) had a son. His <br>name was also Abdullah and he was a very sincere <br>Muslim. When the Mujahidin were about to reach Madi- <br>nah, he drew out his sword and stood just outside the town <br>and, in a challenging tone, said to his Munafiq father: <br>\"I will not allow you to enter Madinah, until you <br>admit with your own tongue that it is you who is mean <br>and Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>exalted.\" <br>This surprised him very much, as the son had always been <br>very respectful to kim, but now he was prepared to kill <br>him, his own father, for the honour of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). The Munafiq had to declare: <br>0)<br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>229 3% <br>L.0 4 <br>\"By Allah! I am mean, and Muhammad (Sallallaho 8 g  <br>alaihe wasallam) is most exalted.\" <br>2;<br>G <br>He was then allowed to enter the town. <br>12. Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) Eagerness to <br>Fight. <br>When the battle of Uhud was over, the remnant of Sa- <br>habah returned to Madinah, most tired and broken. When <br>the Qureysh, on their way back to Mecca, were camping at <br>a place called Hamra-ul Asad, their chief, Abu Sufyan, sat <br>in council with his lieutenants. They said among them- <br>selves: <br>\"The Muslims are defeated in Uhud. Their morale <br>must be very low. This is the best time to finish Mu- <br>hammad.\" <br>They, therefore, decided to return and attack Madinah. <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) received in- <br>telligence about this council, he ordered all those Sahabah <br>who had participated in Uhud, and who had just returned <br>from the battle, to move out of Madinah and meet the <br>enemy on the way. <br>Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I was very eager to fight in Uhud, <br>but my father prevented me from going, on the plea <br>that there was no other member in the house to look <br>after my seven sisters and only one of us could join the <br>campaign. As he had made up his mind to go, he bade <br>me stay back with the family. He met the most coveted <br>end [i.e., martyrdom) in Uhud. Now I am very eager to <br>go with you this time and fight the Qureysh.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) allowed him to <br>go. He was the only person in that campaign who had not <br>fought in Uhud. <br>Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) father was mar-<br>tyred in Uhud. He left Jabir a big family to look after and <br>large debts to clear, with nothing to live on. The debts were <br>due to one of the Jews, who as we know seldom have any <br>soft corner in their hearts for their debtors. Also his seven <br>sisters for whose sake he was not allowed to go to Uhud- <br>were still there to be boked after. Now look! inspite of all <br><br>230 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>1 <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage, 100 000 dinars in prize, and also <br>governorship over the area now ruled by him.\" <br>The fighi was very tough and went on for a long time. <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) succeeded in spotting <br>Jarjir seated behind his forces, under an umbrella of <br>peacock feathers held by two maids. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), all at once, outskirted the Roman <br>troops and approached him. He attacked Jarjir with his <br>sword and severed his head from his body. He then <br>fixed the head oh the point of his spear and returned to <br>his camp, to the utter amazement of both the armies at <br>his matchless valour. <br>When the Sahabah emigrated to Madinah, no son was <br>borne to any of the emigrants for one year after the emigra- <br>tion. The Jews of Madinah said: <br>\"We have cast a spell on the emigrants. They cannot <br>have male issue.\" <br>Abdullah 'bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was the first <br>male child born to the Muhajirin. The Muslims were, natu- <br>rally, very happy over his birth. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not generally allow the children to <br>take oath of allegiance to him. But Abdullah bin Zubair <br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>231 gz <br>Gm;g<br>a <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had the honour of pledging allegiance .=+<br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) when he was <br>g m<br>* <br>only seven. During this battle, he was barely in his early <br>twenties. To go single-handed and kill the commander, <br>after hoodwinking his army of 200 000 men, at this age is <br>really marvellous. <br>14. \t Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) Leads <br>in Salaat. <br>Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We lived with our father at a place on the caravan <br>route to Madinah. When a caravan from Madinah <br>passed our village, we asked the people therein about <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They would <br>tell us that he claimed to be receiving revelations from <br>Allah, and they would also recite a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before us to give us an idea about his claim. <br>Then I immediately used to commit those verses to <br>memory. In this way, I remembered a good portion of <br>the Qur'an, even before I embraced Islam. All the <br>desert tribes were waiting for Mecca to fall to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) before they em- <br>braced Islam. On his victorious entry into Mecca, <br>deputations from all the tribes began to come to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in order to accept <br>Islam. My father headed the group who went to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pledge alle- <br>giance to him on behalf of our tribe. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) taught them the basic <br>regulations about Salaat and other Islamic practices. <br>He said to them, \"The person who knows more Qur'an <br>is entitled to lead in Salaat. Now it so happened that <br>none in my tribe knew so much Qur'an as I did. They <br>searched for an Imam, but they could not find a person <br>knowing more Qur'an than me. I was, therefore, made <br>Imam. At that time, I was only seven. I led the congre; <br>gational Salaat and funeral service if any.\" <br>It was his natural inclination and affinity towards Islam <br>that made him remember so much of the Qur'an when he <br>was only a boy and he had not even embraced Islam. <br><br>232 <br>233 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) used <br>to say to the people: <br>\"Come to me for your difficulties in understanding the <br>Qur'an. I memorised it while I was only a child.\" <br>In another Hadith, he is reported to have said: <br>\"I had completed my reading of the Qur'an when I'was <br>only ten.\" <br>r <br>The reading of the Qur'an by Sahabah was not done <br>like the reading by the non-Arabs of today. Whatever they <br>read, they read with full meaning and explanation. As the <br>impression of something memorised in childhood is very <br>deep and permanent, so Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is accepted as Imam in Tafsir. None of the Sahabah <br>has narrated more Ahadith explaining the meaning of <br>Qur'an than was done by Ibn Abbas. Abdullah bin Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is the best <br>commentator of the Qur'an.\" <br>Abu Abdur Rahman (Rahmatullah alaih), on the authority <br>of Sahabah who taught him the Qur'an, says: <br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion .to Islam <br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was saying his Salaat. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>joined him in Salaat by standing behind him. The Prophet <br>caught him by the hand and drew him to his side. (When <br>there is only one follower in Salaat with Jamaat, he stands <br>by the side of Imam and not after him). While the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was busy in Salaat, he moved <br>back a little distance. When the Salaat was over, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him: <br>\"What made you recede from your place?\" <br>Hesaid: \t \"You are the Prophet of Allah!. How could I <br>stand with you.\" <br>On this occasion too, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) prayed for his knowledge and understanding. <br>17. \t ~ b d u l l a hbin Amr bin Aas Notes Down Ahadith: <br>Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>one of the most pious Sahabah. Daily he used to fast during <br>the day, and finish one Qur'an during the night. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) restrained him from <br>this excessive devotion and said: <br><br>234 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger <br>or humour are actually not meant by him. You should <br>not write each and every thing spoken by him.' I ac- <br>cepted the advice. On my once mentioning this to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he said, 'You <br>keep doing as before. By Him who holds my life in His <br>hand, my lips do not utter anything except the truth, <br>even in anger or joy.\" <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"No one has narrated about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) more than me, except Abdullah bin <br>Amr. This is because he used to note down what he <br>heard, while I relied on my memory.\" <br>This is really wonderful, especially when we know that <br>most of his time was reading the Qur'an and other acts of <br>piety. <br>18. Zaid bin Thabit Memorises the Qur'an. <br>Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of those <br>eminent Sahabah who are considered to be most learned <br>and whose words in religious matters carry much weight. <br>He was an expert in regulations regarding obligatory prac- <br>tices. It is said that he was among the top ranking jurists, <br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>235 <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading. I desire you to learn the Jewish lan- <br>guage.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"In fifteen days, I mastered Hebrew and after that I <br>started doing all such correspondence for him.\" <br>According to another Hadith, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is reported to have similarly mastered the Syriac language <br>at the instance of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>He managed this within the short period of 17 days only. <br>19. Hasan's Knowledge of Islam. <br>The head of Sayyids, Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>born in Ramadhan, 3 A. H. He was thus a little over seven <br>years old at the time of the Prophet's death. In spite of his <br>tender age, quite a few Ahadith have been narrated by him. <br>Abul Howraa once asked him: <br>\"Do you remember any saying of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Yes.

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>20 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>18 <br>Part I (Hadith 4) <br>21 <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the <br>second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is superior to <br>a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies <br>a collection, i.e.. one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a <br>she-camel considered together, and likewise every ayat is <br>superior to the combination of an equal number of he-<br>camels or she-camels. Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. When he <br>landed at Jicldah, some of his friends in business requested <br>him to prolo~ig his stav in Jiddah, so that they could earn <br>more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his blesskd <br>presence. In fact thev wanted that some of the servants of <br>the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. At <br>first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay. <br>but when thev insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the <br>maximum profit that they woutd earn for their goods. Thev <br>explained that the profit was r7t the same in all cases; but <br>the maximum that they could expect was hundred per <br>cent. The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits. <br><br>3 <br>22 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>1.9 <br>Iladhrat 'Aa'ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said. <br>\"One who is well versed in the Qilr'an will be in the <br>c:ompanv of those angels who are scrihes, noble and <br>righteous; and one who falters in reading the Qur'an, <br>-<br>and has to exert hard for learning, gets double the <br>reward.\" <br>\"Orie who is well versed in the Qur'an\" means one <br>\\vho is proficierit in riiemorizitlg as well as in reciting it. It <br>is highly praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and sig- <br>nifir:anc:e as well. \"To be with the angels\" means that, like <br>tht? i~ngels who transferred tlie Qur'a~i from the. Lowhul <br>Mahfooz' (Protectetl 'I'ablet in the Heavens), he also (:on- <br>\\lovs it to othors through its recitatioti and, therefore, both <br>Ilave the salnc occupation; or that he will join the company <br>of such angels on the Day of Judgement. One who faltcrs <br>ivill get double reward-olio for his reading and the other <br>tor liis effort in readi~tg the Qur'an, in spite of fitltt?~.i~~g <br>ag,lin atid again. It does liot rnean that liis reward will <br>c:xc.eed that of a well-versed person. The reward tliot is <br>mt:ntioned for a well-versed person is far gleater. so nluc:h <br>so that he ivill be in the company of special angels. 'The ex- <br>plii~iation is that the labour involved in faltering and tlie <br>tlifficllltics in the reading of the Qur'an carry an indeperi- <br>don1 reward. As such, reading of the Qur'ali should not be <br>given up, even though faltering 1lliiv be ail excuse. <br>M ~ ~ I 1 ; ~<br>'Ali Qari has reproduc:t?ci fmm the riwbyat of Ta-<br>broni and Unihaqi that one ~ ~ 1 1 0<br>(:a11110t menlorizt* the <br>(211r'an well and yet persists i l l  loarning it by heart gets <br>doi~blt: reward. Sitnilarly, one who cherishes a longing for <br>111cmorizi.ingit and does not posst!ss the iibilitv to do so, but <br>doc.s not give up his efforts. will t)e reckoned by Almighty <br>hllah atnorig the hl~ffaili! (Plural of hafiz-one who has <br>laarnt !he whole Qur'an hv heart) on the Day of Kesurrec- <br>t ion. <br>$r <br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>23 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>the Ulama have translated, by way of metaphor, this word <br>hasad as ghibtah, meaning emulation. Ghibtah is permiss- <br>ible in worldly affairs and commendable in religious mat- <br>ters. <br>The second interpretation is that the term hasad has <br>been used in a hypothetical sense, i.e., if hasad were per- <br>missible it would have been so with regard to the two per- <br>sons mentioned above. <br>HADITH- 6 <br><br>24 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast <br>understanding of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Consider, for example, the citron, which gives flavour to <br>the mouth, cleans the stomach and stimulates digestion. <br>These are the qualities specially associated with the <br>reading of the Qur'an since, fragrance in the mouth. inter- <br>nal purity and spiritual strength result from reading the <br>Qur'an. It is also said that if there is citron in the house, no <br>jinn can enter it. If it is true. then such is the speciality of <br>the Qur'an. Some physicians say that citron strengthens the <br>memory and it is rep'orted in 'Ihya' by Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that three things, i.e., cleaning the teeth <br>with miswak, fasting and reading the Holy Qur'an <br>strengthen the memory. <br>i <br>In the book of Abu Dawood, it is mentioned at the con- <br>5 <br>clusion of the hadith given above that a good companion is <br>like a person having musk. Even if vou do not get musk, <br>you will at least enloy its fragrance. An evil companion is <br>like a person with a furnace, near whom, even if you do not <br>get blac:kened, vou certainly cannot avoid the smoke. It is, <br>/i<br>therefore. important that one should be very careful in <br>choosing his companions, with whom he has to mix gener- <br>I <br>ally. <br>i <br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"He misleads many by this Book and guides many <br>thereby.\" <br>At another place we come across: <br>\"And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a <br>healing and mercy for believers, though it increases for <br>the evil-doers naught save ruin.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re- <br>ported to have said: \"Many hypocrites of this Ummat will <br>be the qurraa, i.e., those who recite the Qur'an correctly.\" <br>In 'Ihya-ul-Ulum' it is reported ffom some Mashaa'ikh. \"As <br>soon as a man starts reading a surah (chapter of the Holy <br>Qur'an), the Angels start invoking mercy for him and they <br>continue to do so till he stops reading; on the contrary an- <br>other person starts reading a surah and the Angels start <br>cursing him and they continue to do so till he completes <br>the reading.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that sometimes a man reads <br>the Holy Qur'an and invokes curses on himself without <br>even knowing it. For instance, he reads in the Holy Qur'an: <br><br>26 <br>Virtues of the Htdy Qur'an <br>\"Beware, the curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers\" <br>and he exposes himself to this warning because of his wrong- <br>doings. <br>In the like manner, he reads in the Qur'an: <br>\"The curse of Allah is upon the liars\". <br>In fact he exposes himself to the warning by reason of <br>his being himself a liar. <br>'Aamir ibn Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) say$ that <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhivallaho anho) had appointed Naafi' <br>ibn Abdul Harith as the Governor of Mecca. Once he asked <br>the latter as to whom he had appointed as the administra- <br>tor of forests. \"Ibn Abzi\" replied Naafi'. \"Who is Ibn-e- <br>Abzi?\" said Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). \"He is <br>one of our slaves\" was the reply. \"Why have you appointed <br>a slave the ameer (leader)?\" objected Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho an\\ho). \"Because he recites the Book of Allah\" <br>said Naafi'. At this, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrated the hadith that it had been said by Rasullullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that, because of this Book. <br>Allah elevates many people and degrades many. <br>Hadhrat 'Abdur Rahman ibn 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \",On the Day of Judgement, three things will be <br>under the shade of the Arsh (Allah's Throne). One, the <br>Holy Qur'an which will argue with men-the Qur'an <br>has both an exterior and an interior. The second will <br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  \t<br>27 <br>be amaanat (trust). The third will be kinship, which <br>shall proclaim, '0. Allah! have mercy wn the person <br>who upheld me. and deprive him of Your merry who- <br>soever severed me.' \" <br>\"Three things will be under the shade of the 'Arsh\" <br>signifies their utmost nearness in the sublime preserlce of <br>Allah. \"The Qur'an will argue\" nieans that it will pleacl tht: <br>cause of those people who read it, respect it and act upon <br>its commandments. It will intercede on their behalf and <br>solicit the upgrading of their rank. Mulla 'Ali Qari has tiar- <br>b <br>rated on the authority of 'Tirmizi' (a book of Hadith) that. <br>in the presence of Almighty Allah, the Holy Qur'iin will <br>beg Allah to grant an apparel to its reader. Almightv Allah <br>will give him a crown of honour. The Qur'an will again beg <br>for additional favoitrs for him. Thereupon Alrnighlv All;th <br>will award the reader a complete robe of honour. 'I'llu <br>Qur'an will again beseech Allah to be pleased with him. <br>and Almighty Allah will express His pleasure to him. <br>We find in this life that the pleasure of the belovt:d is <br>considered to be the most coveted gift. Similarly ill the life <br>Hereafter, no bountv shall stand comparison with the <br>pleasure of our ljeloved Alnlighty Allah. And in c a w  of <br>those who ignore their duty towards the Qur'an. it will <br>challenge them saving, \"Did you care for me'? Ilid vou fullil <br>your obligations towards me?\" <br>It has been reported on the authority of Irnnrn Abu <br>Hariifa (Rahn~atullah alaih) in 'Ihya' that it is the clue right <br>of the Qur'an that it should be read completely tu' <br>,I<br>year. Those of us who never care to reaci the Qur'an shoultl <br>first consider how they will defend themselves agilir~st <br>such a strong plaintiff. Death is inevitable and thew (:an l)e <br>no escape from it. <br>i <br>The meaning of the expression \"exterior and interior of <br>the Qur'an\" is evident. The Qur'an has an apparcxlt mean- <br>ing which can be understood by all. but the doepcr spiri- <br>1t <br>tual significance is not understood by everybody. It is in <br>this connection that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said: \"Whosoever expresses his personal opinion <br>in respect of anything .in the dur'an commits <br>niistake. <br>even if he be right in his opinion.\" <br>Some scholars hold that the word 'exterior'. refers to <br>its words, which can be recited properlv by evervbodv and <br>the word 'interior', i.e., spirit, refers to its n~eanings. and its <br>! \t<br>underlying ideas, the understanding of which varies with <br>the ability of the readers. <br>E <br>I i <br><br>28 <br>29 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If vou <br>seek knowledge, you should meditate on the meanings of <br>I <br>the Qur'an, because it embodies the history of former as <br>well as of latter times.\" It is, however, essential to observe <br>the pre-requisites for interpreting the Qur'an. An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>1<br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word <br>has several meanings. A person may be knowing <br>only one or two of them, though in a given context <br>the gctual meaning may be quite different.\" <br>(2) \t Nahw, i.e., syntax, a branch of grammar. w11ic:h <br>helps in understanding the relation of a sentence <br>1<br>with another and also of I'raab (vowel sounds) of <br>the letters of a word. A change in I'raab often <br>means a change in the meaning. <br>(3) Sarf. i.e., et$mology, a branch of grammar, which <br>helps in knowing the root words and conjugations. <br>The moaning of a word changes with the change in <br>the root and with a change in its conjugation. <br>Ibri Faris (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One who loses the <br>knowledge of etymology loses a great deal.\" 'Allamah <br>Zamakhshari (Rahmatullah alaih) mentions that, when a <br>certain person set to translate the ayat- <br>On the day that We shall call each and every people <br>after their leader, <br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta- <br>phors become known. <br>(7) \t llrnul Badee', i.e., knowledge of rhetoric, the <br>knowledge which reveals the beauty of language <br>and its implications. <br>The last three are the branches of Ilmul Balaaghah <br>(knowledge of oratory), clnd are considered very important <br>subjects, which a cornmelltator should master, because the <br>Glorious Qur'an is a perfect miracle and its amazing con- <br>structions can only be understood after mastering these <br>subjects. <br>(8) \t llmul Qirrta'ah, i.e., knowledge of the art of pro- <br>nunciation. because different methods of recita-<br>ti011 sc~metimes convey different meanings, anci <br>so~nekimesone meaning is to be preferred over the <br>other. <br>(9) \t IlmuJ Aqaa'id, i.e.,knowledge of the fundamentals <br>of faith. This is necessarv to explain certain ana- <br>logies. The literal meaning of certain ayaat refer- <br>ring to Almighty Allah is not the correct one. For <br>example, the analogy in the ayat-- <br><br></p></div>"

A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br><br>34 <br>16 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>2 <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>17 / <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br><br>18 <br>19 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br><br>20 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br><br>0 <br>22 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br>Ch.

His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br><br></p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br>0,<br>13 <br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br><br>14 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br><br>34 <br>16 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>2 <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>17 / <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br><br>18 <br>19 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br><br>20 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br><br></p></div>"

A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat!

In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak, the famous Soofi, writes, <br>\"My neighbour at Koofah had a son. The boy fasted during <br>the day and kept praying and hymning during the night. <br>This constant strain emaciated him so much that his body <br>was reduced to a skeleton. His father requested me to ad- <br>monish him. Once I was sitting at my door when the boy <br>passed by. He greeted me with 'Assalaamu alaikum' and sat <br>down. I had hardly said anything when he interrupted <br>saying, 'Dear Uncle! Maybe you intend to admonish me to <br>reduce my pursuits. Listen to my story first. I had a few <br>friends in the locality. We decided among ourselves to vie <br>with one another in worship and adoration of Allah. They <br>all applied themselves so hard that they were soon sent for <br>by Allah. They embraced death delightedly and peacefully. <br>Now I am the only one left behind. What will they think of <br>me when they know of my lagging behind? Dear Uncle! My <br>friends really strived very hard and achieved their goal,' He <br>then began to relate the pursuits and accomplishments of <br>his departed friends, which astonished all the listeners. <br>After this he left me. I heard a few days later that the boy <br>too had died (May Allah bless him).\" <br>Even in these days there are persons who remain en- <br>gaged in salaat for the major portion of the night and <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat <br>Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I love most <br>are: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and reciting the <br>Qur'an.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). \"And I love the three things most: serving a guest, <br>fasting on a very hot day and smiting the enemy with my <br>sword.\" At this, Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) appeared on the <br>scene and said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Allah has sent me to tell you what I would love if I be one <br>of the mortals.\" \"Yes, do tell us, Jibra-eel\", said the <br>Prophet. jibra-eel then replied, \"If I had been like you, I <br>would have loved three things: guiding the people gone <br>astray, loving those who worship in poverty and helping <br>the poor family men. And as for Allah, He loves three <br>I \t<br>characteristics of His slaves: striving in His Path, crying at <br>the time of repentance, and steadfastness in want and <br>hunger.\" <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim writes: 'Salaat ensures daily bread, <br>promotes health, drives out diseases, strengthens the heart, <br>brings light and beauty on the face, pleases the soul, re- <br>freshes the body, cures indolence, relieves the mind, feeds <br>the soul, illumines the heart and guarantees Allah's favour. <br>It grants protection against Allah's Doom. It keeps the Devil <br><br></p></div>"

In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\" <br>WARNING AND REPROACH FOR NEGLECTING <br>SALAAT <br>The books on hadith mention very severe punishment <br>for those who neglect salaat. From many traditions on the <br>s,ubject, only a few are reproduced in this chapter. <br>Although a single warning from the most truthful Prophet <br>3E j,<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was enough, yet we find that, grn<br>out of love and mercy for his followers, he has cautioned <br>them again and again and in various manners lest they <br>should neglect salaat and suffer the consequences. In spite <br>of all this, alas! we are unmindful of salaat, and still we <br>have the audacity to consider ourselves devotees of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and champions of <br>Islam. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>1. \t \"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr and <br>Shirk.\" <br>3. \t \"Discarding of salaat is the only partition between <br>Imaan and Kufr.\" <br>There are a number of ahaadith on the subject. On one <br>occasion, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said: \"Hurry up with your salaat when it <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>34 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us! <br>Hadhrat IJbaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates. 'My. dear friend the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) while enjoining upon me seven good prac- <br>tices said, \"Do not ascribe anything as partner to Allah, <br>though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not forego salaat intentionally, lest you <br>should get out of the fold of Islam; do not perpetrate <br>disobedience of Allah, lest you deserve His wrath; and <br>do not take to drinking, for that is the mother of all <br>evils'.\" <br>In another hadith, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"My dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>warned me saying, 'Do not ascribe anything as partner unto <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>35 <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar-<br>rates: \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined upon me ten things, viz, 'Do not ascribe <br>anything as partner unto Allah, though you may be <br>slain or burnt alive; do not disobey your parents. <br>though you may have to part with your wife or your <br>entire wealth; do not neglect fardh salaat, intention- <br>ally, for Allah is free from obligation to a person who <br>neglects fardh salaat intentionally; do not take wine, <br>for it is an evil habit; that is the root of every uice; do <br>not commit disobedience of Allah, for that brings the <br>wrath of Allah. Do not turn your back to the enemy in <br>battle, though all your comrades may have fallen. Do <br>not fly from the locality where an epidemic has broken <br>out. Do spend on your family members according to <br>your capacity; let your rod be hanging on them, as a <br>warning and to chastise against neglect of their duties <br>towards Allah.\" <br>According to this hadith, we should not spare the roci <br>in checking the children from becoming reckless ih doing <br>anything they like. Sometimes it is necessary to use the <br>rod. It is a pity that out of love we do not use the rod in the <br>beginning and, when the children get spoilt, we cry and <br><br>36 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\" <br>Hadhrat Naufil bin Mu'aawiyah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"A person who has missed one <br>salaat is like one who has lost all his family and <br>wealth.\" <br>Salaat is missed usually when either a person is in the <br>company of his family members or is in pursuit of money. <br>According to this hadith, the ultimate loss sustained in <br>missing a salaat is in no way less than the loss of the whole <br>family and property. In other words, if we miss a salaat we <br>should be as much grieved as when we lose all of our folk <br>and entire belongings. If we are cautioned by some reliable <br>person about the presence of gangsters on a certain road, <br>where people are robbed and killed during the night, we <br>need a lion's heart to ignore the caution and travel on that <br>road even during the day time. Strange enough to note that <br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>37 <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>8<br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>themselves as practical Muslims perform a number of their <br>salaats in combination on returning home, on the very <br>feeble excuses of travel, trade or occupation. To put salaat <br>off till after its set time without a strong excuse (illness, <br>etc) is a major sin. Although it is not so disastrous as neg- <br>lecting salaat, yet it is quite serious. <br>Hadith VI <br>Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while <br>talking about salaat said: \"For its votary, salaat \"shall on <br>the Day of Judgement, be a light for him, an argument <br>in his favour, and a means of his deliverance. Whereas <br>there will be no light, no defence and no deliverance <br><br></p></div>"

Haamaan was <br>his Chief Minister and accomplice. Ubbay bin Khalaf was <br>the most active and severest enemy of Islam among the dis- <br>believers of Mecaa. Before the Hijrah, he used to announce <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) most insolently, <br>\"I have reared a horse, which I feed very well; I will slay <br>you one day riding on its back.\" Once the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied to him, \"Inshaa-allaah! you <br>shall meet your end at my hands.\" In the battle of Uhud, he <br>ran about in the field in search of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is not slain today, then I stand no chance of sur- <br>viving.\" He at last found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and advanced to attack him. The Companions <br>decided to finish him before he reached the Prophet, but <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stopped them. <br>When he came near, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) took a spear from one of the companions and struck <br>him with it, causing a little scratch on his neck. He stag- <br>gered and fell down from his horse and then fled towards <br>his camp crying, \"By Allah, Mtlkammad (SaHallaho alaihe <br>wasalhm) has killed me!\" His people tried to cansole him <br>and told him that it was only a bruise and there was noth- <br>ing to worry h u t ,  but he would say, \"Muhammad (~allal- <br>laho alaihe wasellam) had once announced to me in Mecca <br>that he would kill me. By Allah, had he only spat at me, I <br>would be no more.\" It is said that he cried like a bull. Abu <br>Sufyan, who was very active on that day, put him to shame <br>for crying in that manner over a slight wound, but he said, <br>\"Do you know who has inflicted this injury upon me? It <br>was none other than Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). By Laat and Uzza! if my agony be distributed over all <br>the people of Hijaaz, none of them would survive. Since <br>the time he had declared that he would kill me, I was sure <br>that I would meet my death at his hands. If he only spat at <br>me after that declaration, I would be no more.\" So he died <br>on his way hack, at a day's journey from Mecca. <br>Look! a disbeliever like Ubbay bin Khalaf is so sure <br>about the truth of the Prophet's words that he does not <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of <br>punishment, who knows, may last for thousands of years. <br>Hadith VII <br><br>40 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favours on <br>a person who is mindful of his salaat, viz: His daily bread <br>is made easy for him; he is saved from the punishments in <br>the grave; he shall receive his record in his right hand on <br>the Day of Judgement; he shall cross the Siraat with the <br>speed of lightning and he shall enter Paradise without reck- <br>oning. As for him who neglects his salaat, he shall meet <br>five types of punishments in this world, three at the time of <br>death, three in the grave and three after resurrection. <br>Those in this world are: he is not blessed in life; he is <br>deprived of the light with which the faces of the righteous <br>are endowed; he receives no rewards for his good practices; <br>his prayers are not answered; and he has no share in the <br>prayers of the pious. Those at the time of death are: he dies <br>disgracefully; he dies hungry; he dies in thirst; which the <br>water in the oceans of the world cannot quench. <br>Those in the grave are: He is so squeezed there that the <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other side; fire <br>is burnt inside for him and he is rolled on cinders day and <br>night; a serpent with fiery eyes and iron nails equal in <br>length to a day's journey is let loose on him and shouts <br>with a thundering voice, 'My Lord has charged me with <br>thrashing you till sunrise for neglecting Fajr, till Asr for <br>neglecting Zuhur, till sunset for neglecting Asr, till Ishaa <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>41 <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in <br>mind that even after the declaration of a person as being <br>guilty, Allah is free to pardon him as and when he pleases. <br>He says in His Holy Book: <br>\"Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be as- <br>cribed unto Him. Allah pardoneth all (save that) whom <br>He will. <br>(IV: 116)\" <br>If then it pleases Allah to pardon anybody neglecting <br>salaat, it will be most fortunate; but who can be sure of this <br>fortune? <br>It is also stated in hadith that there will be three courts <br>to be held by Allah on the Day of Judgement. The first will <br>judge between kufr and islaam and there will be no pardon. <br>The second will be to judge the duties and conduct of one <br>towards another. All aggrieved shall be compensated there; <br>compensation will either be realised from the aggressor or <br>paid by Allah Himself, if He pleases to pardon anybody. <br>The third will deal with duties towards Allah. Here the <br>doors of Allah's mercy will be thrown wide-open and He <br>shall pardon anybody He wills. In the light of all that has <br><br>43 <br>42 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>I <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>I<br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>1 <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>I <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>1 <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>to have seen (in his dream) a group of people being treated <br>likewise. Jiba-eel (Alayhis salaam) informed him on his <br>query that thpse were the persons who used to neglect their <br>I <br>salaat. <br>I <br>Mujahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"Allah blesses the <br>people who guard their salaat, just as he blessed Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) and his descendants.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If a <br>person dies with sincere Imaan, observing the command- <br>ments of Allah, performing salaat, and paying Zakaat, <br>when he dies Allah is pleased with him.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Allah says, 'I hold back retribution, deserved by a locality, <br>when I see therein some people who frequently visit the <br>musjid, love one another for My sake, and pray for forgive- <br>ness in the hours of darkness.\" <br>Hadhmt Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) wrote to <br>Hadhrat Salmaan: \"Spend most of your time in the musiid. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"The musjid is the abode of the pious. Allah has <br>taken upon Himself to bless the person who spends most of <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand- <br>ing at a distance.\" <br>One of the companions reports that, when the inmates <br>of the Prophet's house were hard-pressed in any way, he <br>would enjoin salaat on them and recite the following verse: <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision, We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for the righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that she heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"All the <br>people will be gathered together on the Day of Judgement <br>and they will all hear the voice of the announcing angel. <br>He will say, 'where are those who glorified Allah in ease <br>and adversity?' A group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. It will then be announced, 'where are <br>those who forsook their beds and spent their nights in <br>worship?' Another group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. The angel will again announce, 'where <br><br>44 <br>45 <br>i<br>Virtues of Salaat <br>I <br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>, <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>l <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The <br>reckoning will then commence after these three groups <br>have been eliminated.\" <br>1 <br>It is said that during the early times people could see <br>Satan. A person approached him saying how could he be <br>like him. Satan told him that had he never received such a <br>request before and asked hin? what had prornpted him to <br>ask for it. The person told him that he wished it from his <br>heart. Satan told him to neglect his salaat and to swear very <br>frequently, not caring whether he was doir~g it truthfully. <br>The person told Satan that he would swear by Allah never <br>to give up salaat and swear falsely. Satan told him that <br>never before he had been tricked by a human being to seek <br>his advice. He was determined never to do so in future. <br>Xadhrat Ubayv (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Give glad tidings to the Muslims that they shall be hon- <br>oured and exalted, and their religion shall prevail, but <br>there is no portion in the Hereafter for those who exploit <br>Islam for wordlv gains.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"I saw Allah in His best form. He said to me, '0 <br>'Muhammad! what are the Highest Chiefs (Angels) arguing <br>about'?' I said, 'I have no knowledge about that.' Allah <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the <br>questioning of Angels, is a shade against the Sun on the <br>Day of Judgement, is a protection against the fire of Hell, is <br>a weight for the scales of good deeds, is a means of swift <br>crossing over the Siraat arid is a key to Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthmarl (Radhiyallaho anho) is reported to <br>have said. \"Allah bestows nine fdvours on a person who <br>guards his salaat and is particular in performing it at its ap- <br>pointed hours: viz; He is loved by Allah, he enjoys good <br>health, is constantly under the protection of angels, his <br>home is blessed, the light of righteousrless shines on his <br>face, his heart is made soft, he shall cross the Siraat with <br>the speed of lightning, he is saved from Hell, and his neigh- <br>bours in Paradise are those about whom Allah has said. <br>'There shall be no fear come upon them, neither shall <br>they grieve (11: 36). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Salaat <br>is the Pillar of Islam and it has ten virtues, viz: It is a charm <br>of the face, a light of the heart, health and refreshment for <br>the bodv, a companv in the grave, a means for the descent <br><br></p></div>"

But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"There is no place in Islaam for a person who <br>does .not say his salaat, and there is no salaat without <br>wudhu.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) also heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying. \"There is no Islaam in a person when <br>there is no salaat by him. The position of salaat in <br>Islaam is as the position of the head in a body.\" <br>Let those who do not offer salaat, and not onlv call <br>themselves Muslims, but also boast of their being cham- <br>pions of the Muslim cause, ponder over these words of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They dream of <br>reviving the past glory of Islaam. but would not care to <br>know how rigidly the people responsible for that glory <br>stuck to the practices of Islaam. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhivallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eve. People told him that the dis- <br>ease could be treated, but he would have to miss his salaat <br>for a few days. He said: \"This is not possible; I have heard <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>2 <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>52<br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer- <br>tain man and said, \"Take this one; he is particular about <br>his salaat. But you are not to beat him. We are forbidden to <br>beat one who says salaat.\" We, on the other hand, mock at <br>our servant and consider him a liability if he goes for <br>salaat. <br>Sufyaan 'rhauri (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous Soofi <br>once fell into a state of ecstasy. He remained in his house <br>for seven days without sleep, food and drink. When his <br>Shaikh was informed of his condition, he inquired if Su- <br>fyaan was observing the hours of his salaat. He was told <br>that his salaat was quite regular and safe. At this, the <br>Shaikh remarked, \"Glory be to Allah, Who has not allowed <br>the Devil to have an upper hand on him! \" <br><br>Part I1 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>51<br>28 <br>in His word; and who realize the value of the blessings and <br>reward in the Hereafter. It is in respect of such people that <br>Allah says: <br>PART I1 <br>IMPORTANCE OF JAMAAT <br>\"Men, whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>As has already been said in tne foreword, there are many <br>then from remembrance of Allah and constancy in <br>who say their salaat regularly but are not very particular <br>salaat.\" <br>(XXIV;37). <br>about Jamaat. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>It is said of Saalim Haddaad (Rahmatullah alaih] (a .-,-<br>as emphatic in enjoining Jamaat as he is particular about <br>trader and a great Soofi) that on hearing Azaan he would <br>g 2<br>salaat. This part also consists of two chapters. The first <br>turn pale and grow restless. He would stand up immedi- .Ez<br>deals with the rewards of Jamaat and the second with the <br>ately, leaving his shop open and recite these couplets:- <br>><br>consequences of its neglect. <br>1. \"When Thy summoner stands up to summon, <br>CHAPTER I <br>quickly I stand up. <br>To respond to (the summons of) The Mighty Lord <br>REWARDS OF JAMAAT <br>Who hath no peer.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"I reply to the summons with complete submis- <br>sion and cheer, 'Here am I, 0 Bountiful One.\" <br>Hadith I <br>3. \t<br>\"My face grows pale with awe and fear, and occu- <br>pation in Thee distracts me from all other occupa- <br>tions.\" <br>4. <br>\"I swear by Thee, naught is dear to me save Thy <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>remembrance. <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>Nothing is more ravishing for me than Thy sweet <br>sallam) saying: \"A salaat with Jamaat is twenty-seven <br>name.\" <br>times superior to salaat performed individually.\" <br>5. \t \"0,will th'ere be a time for us to be together? <br>When we offer our salaat for getting reward from <br>A lover is happy only when he is with his love.\" <br>Allah, then why should it not be done in the musjid, where <br>the reward earned is twenty-seven times more. Nobody <br>6. \"He whose eyes have seen the light of Thy Beauty <br>will be so unwise as to forego a profit twenty-seven times <br>Can never be solaced. He must die yearning for <br>greater with simply a little extra labour. But we are so in- <br>Thee.\" <br>different about the profits promised for our religious prac- <br>It is said in a hadith: \"People frequenting the musjid <br>tices! This can be due to nothing but our disregard for deen <br>are its pegs (dwellers). Angels are their companioris and <br>and the rewards of it. It is a pity that we apply ourselves so <br>visit them when they are sick and help them when they are <br>hard to acquiring the trifling gains in this material world; <br>at their jobs.\" <br>but are so unmindful of the gains in the Hereafter, which <br>yield twenty-seven times more with a little extra effort. We <br>Hadith I1 <br>often argue that for going to the musjid for Jamaat we have <br>to close the shop and will thus lose business. These pre- <br>texts and others of the kind cannot stand in the way of <br>those who have perfect faith in the Greatness of Allah, and <br><br>53 <br>52 \t<br>Virtues of Salaat <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\" <br>In Hadith No. I, the superiority of salaat with Jamaat <br>over that offered individually is described as being twenty- <br>seven times more, while this hadith mentions only twenty- <br>five times. Various theologians have discussed at length <br>this seeming inconsistency. The following are some of the <br>explanations: <br>1 <br>1. \t \"This variation from twenty-five to twenty-seven <br>is due to variation of ikhlaas (sincerity) in differ- <br>ent individuals.\" <br>I <br>2. \t<br>\"In Sirri (quiet) salaat (i.e., Zuhr and Asr), it is <br>twenty-five times, while in Jahri (loud) salaat (i.e., <br>Fajr, Maghrib and Ishaa), it is twenty-seven <br>1<br>times.\" <br>3. \t \"In Fajr and Ishaa, when it is somewhat incon- <br>venient to go out due to cold and darkness, it is <br>twenty-seven times, but in other salaats it is <br>twenty-five times.\" <br>4. \t \"In the beginning it was twenty-five times, but <br>subsequently Allah (by special favour on the fol- <br>lowers of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>raised the reward to twenty-seven times.\" <br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the <br>ihraam (Hajj apparel) at his house, leaves for Hajj\". <br>Further, in the same hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) points to another act of great value; i.e., as <br>long as one remains sitting in musjid after the salaat is <br>over, the angels pray for him asking for forgiveness and <br>mercy. The angels are the innocent and holy creation of <br>Allah. So, the effectiveness of their prayers is self-evident. <br>Muhammad bin Samaak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous theologian and Sheikh. He died at the age of one <br>hundred and three. He used to perform two hundred <br>rakaats of nafl salaat daily. He writes: \"For forty years, I <br>never _missed the first takbeer of salaat with Jamaat, except <br>once when my mother had died.\" The same Shaikh writes: <br>\"Once I missed the Jamaat. As I knew that salaat with <br>Jamaat was twenty-five times superior, I repeated this <br>salaat (individually) twenty-five times to make up the loss. <br>I heard in my dream some one saying to me, 'Muhammad! <br>You have repeated your salaat 25 times (in the hope of <br>making good the loss), but what about the 'Aameen' by the <br>Angels?\" It is reported in many ahaadith that when the <br>Imaam says 'Aameen' after Fatihah, the Angels also say <br>Aameen and all the past sins of a person whose Ameen <br>coincides with that of the Angels are forgiven. This is <br><br>54 <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>55<br>Virtues of Salaat <br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: \"If one wishes to meet Allah on the Day of Judge- <br>ment as a Muslim, he must say his salaat at a place <br>where Azaan is called out, viz., a musjid, as Allah has <br>prescribed through His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) such practices which are nothing but guid- <br>ance through and through: and salaat (with Jamaat) is <br>one of them. If you start saying your salaat at your <br>houses (as.so and so is doing), then vou will be dis-<br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) led the salaat at his instance, and <br>he himself joined the Jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to him, <br>\"Worship your Lord as if you see Him before you, count <br>yourself among the dead, beware of the curse of the <br>wronged ones and, even if you could crawl to the musjid, <br>do not miss Ishaa and Fajr with Jamaat.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"Ishaa and Fajr are very <br>heavy on those who are munaafiq. If they knew the reward <br>of the Jamaat, they would go to the musjid and join the <br>Jamaat even if they had to crawl.\" <br>Hadith IV <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Maalik (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br><br>57 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>saying, \"A person who in all sincerity is constant in <br>his salaat with Jamaat for forty days, without missing <br>the first takbeer, recieves two awards: one for deliv- <br>erance from Hell and the ~ t h e r  for freedom from <br>nifaaq.\" <br>If a person is regular in his salaat (with sincerity) for <br>forty days and joins the Jamaat from the very start (i.e., <br>when the Imaam calls out his first takbeer), then he shan <br>neither be a munaafiq nor shall he go to Hell. A munaafiq <br>is a person who feigns being a Muslim, but there is kufr in <br>his heart., Genesis of man (according to hadith) takes place <br>in periods of forty days. This seems to be the significance <br>of forty days in this hadith, and so the Soofis attach import- <br>ance to this period (called Chillah in Urdu) for purposes of <br>spiritual discipline. <br>Lucky indeed are the persons who do not miss their <br>first takbeer for years together. <br>Hadith V <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who performs wudhu scrupulously, <br>and then goes to the musjid and finds that Jamaat is <br>over, receives a reword equal to that of Jamaat. This <br>would not diminish anything from the reward of those <br>who have actually performed their salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>This is indeed Allah's great favour and beneficence <br>that the mere effort and a slight exertion is enough to en- <br>title us to a reward of Jamaat, though actually we fail to <br>join it. Who is the loser then if we ourselves get left, and <br>miss the bounties of the most Bountiful? <br>This hadith also shows that we-should not postpone <br>going to the musjid in apprehension of the Jamaat being <br>over. Even if we find on reaching the musjid that Jamaat is <br>over, we will still get the reward thereof. If, however, we <br>are certain that the Jamaat is already over, then there is of <br>course no idea in going to the musjid for Jamaat. <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>4<br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not <br>correct, as in the first place they are deprived of the reward <br>of saying salaat in the musjid and secondly, they lose the <br>blessing of salaat with a big Jamaat. The bigger the congre- <br>gation, the more pleasing it is to Allah. When our sole dim <br>is to achieve the pleasure of Allah, why should we not <br>adopt a manner more pleasing to Him. It is reported in a <br>hadith that Allah is pleased to see three things, namely, a <br>row of worshippers offering salaat with Jamaat, a persor, <br>busy in salaat at the time of Tahajjud at the dead of night, <br>and a person fighting in the way of Allah.\" <br>Hadith VII <br>Hadhrat Sahl bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Give glad tidings to those who go to the <br>musjid frequently during hours of darkness, for they <br>will have perfect light on the Day of Judgement.\" <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>THE VIRTUES OF ZIKR <br>FOREWORD <br>IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MOST GRACIOUS, THE <br>MOST MERCIFUL <br>The sacred name of Almighty Allah carries the bles- <br>sings, taste, sweetness, thrill, and peace of mind that is in- <br>variably experienced by one who has practised and <br>remained absorbed in His zikr for a considerable time. This <br>name brings joy to the heart and peace of mind. Almighty <br>Allah has said Himself: <br>\"Lo! the zikr of Allah provides satisfaction for the <br>hearts.\" <br>Today there is a wave of discontentment in the whole <br>world; and the letters that I receive daily contain mostly ac- <br>counts of worries and anxieties. The object of this booklet <br>is that people who lack peace of mind, whether in an indi- <br>vidual or collective capacity, may be told how to overcome <br>their malady and that the good and blessed persons may be <br>benefitted by the general publication of the virtues of zikr <br>of Almighty Allah. It is just possible that the study of this <br>booklet may inspire some people to recite the sacred name <br>of Allah with sincerity (ikhlaas) and this may prove useful <br>to me (also) at the time when only good deeds will prove <br>helpful. Of course, Almighty Allah can, through His sheer <br>grace, forgive one who has no good deeds to his credit. <br>Besides this, the thing which prompted me to this <br>undertaking was that Almighty Allah, through His extreme <br>Benevolence and Grace has blessed my uncle, Hazrat Mu-<br>hammad Ilyas Kandhlavi, who resides in Nizamuddin <br>(Delhi) with a special insight and zeal for the work of Ta- <br>bleegh, the activities of which are no longer confineti to <br>India alone, but have reached Hijaaz as well. This move- <br>= <br>8 5 <br>KI <br>5 <br><br>12 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>32 <br>ment is well known and needs no introduction. Its good re- <br>sults soon began to be visible in India and abroad <br>generally, but especially so in the region of Mewat, as is <br>well-known. The fundamental principles of this movement <br>are basically very sound, good and strong, and are inhe- <br>rently fruitful and bedicial. One 'of the important prin- <br>ciples is that those who are engaged in Tableegh work <br>should be particular in practising zikr, and more so when <br>they are actually busy in Tabligh work. After observing the <br>wonderful results of this practice, I myself felt the neces- <br>sity of writing this booklet. I was also ordered by my re- <br>spected uncle that the virtues of zikr of Allah should be <br>compiled and made available to them, so that those who so <br>far practise it out of obedience to Allah may themselves <br>feel an urge for doing so for the sake of its virtues, and <br>thereby realise that zikr is a great wealth. <br>It is neither possible for a humble person like myself to <br>compile a comprehensive treatise on the virtues of zikr, nor <br>is it humanly possible to do full justice to this subject. I <br>have however briefly described some narrations relating to <br>this subject. I have divided the book into three chapters, of <br>which the virtues of zikr in general are described in the <br>first chapter, those of Kalimah Tayyibah in the second and <br>those of the third Kalimah (known as Tasbeeh-Fatimah) in <br>the third. <br>CHAPTER I <br>VIRTUES OF ZIKR IN GENERAL <br>Even if there were no ayat or hadith relating to zikr, we <br>should not have forgotten to remember our real Benefactor, <br>Whose blessings and favours on us at all times are unlimi- <br>ted, and have no parallel. It is but natural that we should <br>remember our Benefactor, perform His zikr (remember <br>Him) and thank Him. Countless virtues of zikr are de-<br>scribed in the Qur'an and.Ahaadith, and the sayings and <br>deeds of our elders in support thereof are available for our <br>benefit. No doubt, the blessings of the glorious zikr of Allah <br>are unlimited and its effulgence is so sublime. <br>Here, I first describe a few ayaat (Verses from the Holy <br>Qur'an) and then some ahaadith on the subject of His <br>glorious zikr. <br>SECTION 1 <br>QuranicVerses relating Zikr <br>0 <br>8 s4 <br>E N  <br>5 <br>1.Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give <br>thanks to Me and reject not Me. <br>1 <br>2. When (during the Hajj) ye pass on in the multitude <br>from Arafaat, remember Allah by the sacred monument. <br>Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before <br>this ye were of those gone astray. <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>57 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>saying, \"A person who in all sincerity is constant in <br>his salaat with Jamaat for forty days, without missing <br>the first takbeer, recieves two awards: one for deliv- <br>erance from Hell and the ~ t h e r  for freedom from <br>nifaaq.\" <br>If a person is regular in his salaat (with sincerity) for <br>forty days and joins the Jamaat from the very start (i.e., <br>when the Imaam calls out his first takbeer), then he shan <br>neither be a munaafiq nor shall he go to Hell. A munaafiq <br>is a person who feigns being a Muslim, but there is kufr in <br>his heart., Genesis of man (according to hadith) takes place <br>in periods of forty days. This seems to be the significance <br>of forty days in this hadith, and so the Soofis attach import- <br>ance to this period (called Chillah in Urdu) for purposes of <br>spiritual discipline. <br>Lucky indeed are the persons who do not miss their <br>first takbeer for years together. <br>Hadith V <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who performs wudhu scrupulously, <br>and then goes to the musjid and finds that Jamaat is <br>over, receives a reword equal to that of Jamaat. This <br>would not diminish anything from the reward of those <br>who have actually performed their salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>This is indeed Allah's great favour and beneficence <br>that the mere effort and a slight exertion is enough to en- <br>title us to a reward of Jamaat, though actually we fail to <br>join it. Who is the loser then if we ourselves get left, and <br>miss the bounties of the most Bountiful? <br>This hadith also shows that we-should not postpone <br>going to the musjid in apprehension of the Jamaat being <br>over. Even if we find on reaching the musjid that Jamaat is <br>over, we will still get the reward thereof. If, however, we <br>are certain that the Jamaat is already over, then there is of <br>course no idea in going to the musjid for Jamaat. <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>4<br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not <br>correct, as in the first place they are deprived of the reward <br>of saying salaat in the musjid and secondly, they lose the <br>blessing of salaat with a big Jamaat. The bigger the congre- <br>gation, the more pleasing it is to Allah. When our sole dim <br>is to achieve the pleasure of Allah, why should we not <br>adopt a manner more pleasing to Him. It is reported in a <br>hadith that Allah is pleased to see three things, namely, a <br>row of worshippers offering salaat with Jamaat, a persor, <br>busy in salaat at the time of Tahajjud at the dead of night, <br>and a person fighting in the way of Allah.\" <br>Hadith VII <br>Hadhrat Sahl bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Give glad tidings to those who go to the <br>musjid frequently during hours of darkness, for they <br>will have perfect light on the Day of Judgement.\" <br><br>58 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the <br>Qur'an' <br>\"He only shall tend Allah's musjid who believes in <br>Allah and the L,ast Day.\" <br>(IV:18).\" <br>The following are a few more ahaadith about the vir- <br>tues of salaat with Jamaat:- <br>1. \t \"Making wudhu when inconvenient, walking to- <br>wards 'the musjid and sitting there (after one <br>salaat), waiting for the next salaat, wipe out the <br>sins.\" <br>2. \t \"The farther a person lives from the 'musjid' the <br>greater the hlessing he receives.\" This is so be- <br>cause a person coming from a distance shall have <br>to walk more and, as already mentioned, every <br>step will fetch him a blessing. For this very reason <br>some companions have been reported to be taking <br>short steps in going to the musjid in order to earn <br>more blessings. <br>3. \t<br>\"There are three things in this world for which <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>59 <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>5<br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>explain the importance of salaat with Jamaat, but their <br>explanations vary with the extent of their understanding <br>and their power to probe into Divine secrets. Our respected <br>Shaikh, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (may Allah illumine his <br>grave), in his famous Book 'Hujjatullahil Balighah' <br>writes:-<br>\"To save the people from the fatal effects that their <br>own customs and rituals can bring them, there is nothing <br>more useful than to make one of the religious services so <br>common a custom and so public a ritual that it may be per- <br>formed openly before everybody by any person, whether he <br>be learned or illiterate. The town-folk and the countrymen <br>should both be equally anxious to observe it. It should <br>become a subject of rivalry and pride among all of them, <br>and ~t should be so universally practised that it becomes <br>part and parcel of their social set-up, so much so, that life <br>without it may be worthless for them. If this is achieved, it <br>will help in establishing the worship and obedience of <br>Allah and will form a very useful substitute for those <br>rituals and customs which could cause them serious harm. <br>Since salaat is the only religious observance that surpasses <br>all others in importance and universality, both in reason <br>and authority, it becomes therefore absolutely necessary to <br><br>60 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>hearts and souls turned to Him alone, have the wonderful <br>effect of causing His blessings and Mercy to descend from <br>Heaven. <br>\"Moreover, the Muslim community has been raised so <br>that the word of Allah be held supreme and Islamic Order <br>be paramount over all others. This object cannot be <br>achieved unless all Muslims, big and small, the elite and <br>the common, the town folk and the countrymen, perform <br>alike the most sublime service and the most sacred ritual of <br>Islam (i.e., salaat) by assembling together in one place. It is <br>for this reason that the Sharee-at (Islamic Law) lays such <br>special stress on Friday congregation and on salaat with <br>jamaat, by explaining the blessings that accrue therefrom <br>and punishments awarded for neglect 1 lereof. For the open <br>and conspicuous observance of this im?ortant service, two <br>types of assemblies are required: one fr~rpeople of a clan or <br>a particular locality and the other for the people of the <br>whole town. Since the assembly or\" the former at any hour <br>is convenient and that of the latte, comparatively difficult, <br>so for the former, the gathering for salaat (with jamaat) five <br>times daily, has been laid down and in the case of the latter <br>gathering, the weekly Friday salaat has been devised and <br>ordained.\" <br>CHAPTER I1 <br>REPROACH ON GIVING UP JAMAAT <br>Just as Allah has promised rewards and blessings for <br>adhering to His commandments, so has He warned us of <br>the woeful consequences and punishments for their neg- <br>lect. We are in bondage to Allah and as such it is obligatory <br>on us to obey Him. No compensation or reward is due to us <br>for our obedience to Him. If He gives a reward, it is surely a <br>matter of His extreme favour on us. Similarly no punish- <br>ments can be too much for us if we disobey Him-our Lord, <br>for their can be no greater crime for a bondsman than to <br>disobey his Master. Hence no warning or premonition was <br>required to be imparted. Yet Allah and His Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) have so very kindly cautioned <br>us in various ways, warned us frequently of the conse-<br>quences and explained to us again and again, just to save <br>us from disaster. If even then, we don't take a lesson, who <br>collld there be to save us from the inevitable consequences? <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"I <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"If a person in spite of hearing the azaan does not go to <br>the musjid (and he prefers to say his salaat at home) <br>without a strong excuse, then his salaat is not ac-<br>cepted. When the Companions inquired as to what <br>could be a strong excuse, he replied, \"Illness or fear.\" <br>It may perhaps appear from this Hadith that the salaat <br>performed at home (after hearing the Azaan) is no salaat at <br>all; the Hanafiyyah do not hold this view. According to <br>them, though the reward and blessings promised for fardh <br>salaat will not be awarded, yet the person saying the salaat <br><br>62 <br>63 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br><br>64 <br>65 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus- <br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those <br>places (mosques) where the Azaan is said: \"On the day <br>when the glory of Saaq is revealed and they are or- <br>dered to prostrate themselves, but are not able, with <br>eyes downcast, abasement stupifying them. And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>THE VIRTUES OF ZIKR <br>FOREWORD <br>IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MOST GRACIOUS, THE <br>MOST MERCIFUL <br>The sacred name of Almighty Allah carries the bles- <br>sings, taste, sweetness, thrill, and peace of mind that is in- <br>variably experienced by one who has practised and <br>remained absorbed in His zikr for a considerable time. This <br>name brings joy to the heart and peace of mind. Almighty <br>Allah has said Himself: <br>\"Lo! the zikr of Allah provides satisfaction for the <br>hearts.\" <br>Today there is a wave of discontentment in the whole <br>world; and the letters that I receive daily contain mostly ac- <br>counts of worries and anxieties. The object of this booklet <br>is that people who lack peace of mind, whether in an indi- <br>vidual or collective capacity, may be told how to overcome <br>their malady and that the good and blessed persons may be <br>benefitted by the general publication of the virtues of zikr <br>of Almighty Allah. It is just possible that the study of this <br>booklet may inspire some people to recite the sacred name <br>of Allah with sincerity (ikhlaas) and this may prove useful <br>to me (also) at the time when only good deeds will prove <br>helpful. Of course, Almighty Allah can, through His sheer <br>grace, forgive one who has no good deeds to his credit. <br>Besides this, the thing which prompted me to this <br>undertaking was that Almighty Allah, through His extreme <br>Benevolence and Grace has blessed my uncle, Hazrat Mu-<br>hammad Ilyas Kandhlavi, who resides in Nizamuddin <br>(Delhi) with a special insight and zeal for the work of Ta- <br>bleegh, the activities of which are no longer confineti to <br>India alone, but have reached Hijaaz as well. This move- <br>= <br>8 5 <br>KI <br>5 <br><br>12 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>32 <br>ment is well known and needs no introduction. Its good re- <br>sults soon began to be visible in India and abroad <br>generally, but especially so in the region of Mewat, as is <br>well-known. The fundamental principles of this movement <br>are basically very sound, good and strong, and are inhe- <br>rently fruitful and bedicial. One 'of the important prin- <br>ciples is that those who are engaged in Tableegh work <br>should be particular in practising zikr, and more so when <br>they are actually busy in Tabligh work. After observing the <br>wonderful results of this practice, I myself felt the neces- <br>sity of writing this booklet. I was also ordered by my re- <br>spected uncle that the virtues of zikr of Allah should be <br>compiled and made available to them, so that those who so <br>far practise it out of obedience to Allah may themselves <br>feel an urge for doing so for the sake of its virtues, and <br>thereby realise that zikr is a great wealth. <br>It is neither possible for a humble person like myself to <br>compile a comprehensive treatise on the virtues of zikr, nor <br>is it humanly possible to do full justice to this subject. I <br>have however briefly described some narrations relating to <br>this subject. I have divided the book into three chapters, of <br>which the virtues of zikr in general are described in the <br>first chapter, those of Kalimah Tayyibah in the second and <br>those of the third Kalimah (known as Tasbeeh-Fatimah) in <br>the third. <br>CHAPTER I <br>VIRTUES OF ZIKR IN GENERAL <br>Even if there were no ayat or hadith relating to zikr, we <br>should not have forgotten to remember our real Benefactor, <br>Whose blessings and favours on us at all times are unlimi- <br>ted, and have no parallel. It is but natural that we should <br>remember our Benefactor, perform His zikr (remember <br>Him) and thank Him. Countless virtues of zikr are de-<br>scribed in the Qur'an and.Ahaadith, and the sayings and <br>deeds of our elders in support thereof are available for our <br>benefit. No doubt, the blessings of the glorious zikr of Allah <br>are unlimited and its effulgence is so sublime. <br>Here, I first describe a few ayaat (Verses from the Holy <br>Qur'an) and then some ahaadith on the subject of His <br>glorious zikr. <br>SECTION 1 <br>QuranicVerses relating Zikr <br>0 <br>8 s4 <br>E N  <br>5 <br>1.Therefore remember Me, I will remember you.

Allah hath <br>promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, <br>forgiveness and immense reward. <br>COMMENTARY <br>In these verses though the emphasis obviously is on <br>the blessings occurrirlg from ruku, sujood and salaat but <br>there is also an indication about the blessings associated <br>with the second part of the Kalimah viz. (Muhammadur <br>Rasulullah). <br>Imam Raazi (Rahmatullah alaih) has related that in the <br>treaty of Hudaibiyah, on the refusal and insistence of the <br>unbeliever not to write 'Muhammad Rasulullah' and to <br>substitute it by 'Muhammad bin Abdullah', Allah Ta'aalaa <br>asserts that He himself bears testimony to the Prophethood <br>of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). When the <br>Sender confirms personally about a particular person to be <br>His messenger, then the non-acceptance by any number of <br>people does not matter. To confirm this testimony, Allah <br>Ta'aalaa made the statement 'Muhammadur Rasulullah' <br>(Muhammad is a Prophet of Allah). <br>There are other important subjects in these verses. One <br>of them relates to the glow on the face of a blessed person. <br>It has been explained that a person who keeps a vigil at <br>night for prayers develops such a glow on his face. Imaam <br>Raazi (Rahmatullah alaih) considers it an established fact <br>that if two persorls keep awake at night, one spending it in <br>sensual and idle pleasures and the other uses his time in <br>reciting the Qur'an, learning religious knowledge and offer- <br>ing pravers, thev will get up with different facial express- <br>ions the next morning. The latter described above will be <br>because of his spiritual glow, will show himself quite a dif-<br>ferent person. <br>Ch. I: Quranic Verses relating Zikr <br>The third important thing is that Imaam Maalik (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) and a group of scholars established kufr for <br>those people who talk ill of the Sahaba and bear hatred <br>against them. <br>45. Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who be- <br>lieve to submit to Allah's reminder? <br>(r <br>v, L<br>46. (Mentioning of the hypocrites.)

And when the (Friday) prayer is ended, then dis- <br>perse in the land and seek of Allah's bounty, (with the per- <br>mission to engage yourself in worldly pursuits but even <br>then) and remember Allah much, that ye may be success- <br>ful. <br>48. 0 ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your <br>children distract you from remembrance of Allah. Those <br>who do so, they are the losers. (These things will not last <br>beyond the grave and Allah's remembrance will prove <br>useful in the Hereafter. <br><br>24 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>49. And Lo! those who disbelieve would fain discon- <br>cert thee with their eyes when they hear the message (the <br>Qur'an) and they say, \"Lo! he is indeed mad.\" <br>Note: Using the eyes in this manner indicates their ex- <br>treme enmity. Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) advises <br>benediction on a person, affected by malignant looks, after <br>reciting this verse. <br>50. And whoso turneth away from the remembrance of <br>His Lord; He will thrust him into ever-growing torment. <br>51. And when the devotee of Allah (Muhammad Sal-<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) stood up in prayer to Him, they <br>crowded on him, almost stifling him. Say (unto them, 0 <br>Muhammad), I pray unto Allah only, and ascribe to Him no <br>partner. <br>52. So remember the name of thy Lord and devote thy- <br>self to him with whole-hearted devotion. (All other attach- <br>ments should be reversed at that time and devotion to <br>Allah should dominate). <br>Ch. I: Quranic Verses relating Zikr <br>25 <br>54. He is successful who purifieth himself (of evil <br>manners) and remembereth the name of his Lord, so <br>prayeth. <br>53. Remember the name of thy Lord at morning and <br>evening; and worship Him (a portion) of the night, and <br>glorify Him through long night in Tahajjud salaat. Lo! these <br>eople who oppose you, love the fleeting life, and put <br>gehind them (the remembrance of) a grievous day. <br><br>Chapter 1 <br>SECTION 2 <br>AHAADITH ON ZIKR <br>(REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH) <br>When the importance of zikr has been emphasised in <br>so many verses of the Holy Qur'an, the number of ahaadith <br>on this subject is naturally far too great; it is in proportion <br>to the many voluminous books of ahaadith. The Holy <br>Qur'an is one book of only 30 parts, but the books of ahaa- <br>dith are many and each book contains a large number of <br>ahaadith. For example, Bukhari Shareef alone consists of <br>30 voluminous parts, and similarly Abu Dawood Shareef <br>has 32 parts. There is no book of ahaadith which does not <br>contain several ahaadith on the subject of zikr, and it is, <br>therefore impossible to quote all such ahaadith in this <br>small booklet. Of course, a single verse of the Holy Qur'an <br>or a hadith moves the faithful-to good actions, but volumes <br>of books would not move an unwilling person, who is like <br>an ass carrying a load of books. <br>Hadith No 1 <br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>2 7 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Almighty Allah says, 'I treat my slave (man) accord- <br>ing to his expectations from Me, and I am with him <br>when he remembers Me, If he remembers Me in his <br>heart, I remember him in My heart; if he remembers <br>Me in a gathering, I remember him in a better and <br>nobler gathering (i.e. of angels). If he comes closer to <br>Me by one span, I go towards him a cubit's length, if he <br>comes towards Me by a cubit's length, I go towards <br>him an arm's length, and if he walks towards Me, I run <br>unto him.\" <br>Note: There are several points elaborated in this <br>hadith. The first point is that Allah deals with a man <br>according to his expectations from Him. One should there- .s <br>fore always be hopeful of the mercy and benevolence of <br>9;<br>Almighty Allah and never be despondent of His blessings. <br>y N <br>Certainly, we are extremely sinful and justly deserve pun- <br>5 <br>ishment on account of our evil deeds, yet in no case should <br>we feel despondent of the mercy of Allah, as He may per- <br>haps totally forgive us. <br>\"Lo! Allah forgiveth not if a artner be ascribed unto <br>Him and forgiveth all save that to w \\om He will.\" <br>But Almighty Allah may or map ,not forgive; that is <br>why the Ulama say that true belief lies in between hope (of <br>forgiveness of Allah) and fear (of His wrath). The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once visited a young <br>Sahabi, who was breathing his last, and asked him how he <br>was feeling. He replied, \"O!Messenger of Allah, I am hope- <br>ful of the mercy of Allah, and yet I am afraid of my sins.\" <br>Thereupon the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said \"When the heart of a believer is filled with these two <br>feelings of hope and fear, Almighty Allah fulfils his hope <br>and saves him from what he is afraid of.\" <br>It is mentioned in one hadith that a believer thinks of <br>his sin, as if he is sitting under a huge rock that is threaten- <br>ing to fall on him, while for a transgressor his sin is no <br>more than a fly which is easily scared off, i.e., he takes his <br>sins very lightly. In short, one should be appropriately <br>afraid of ones sins, and at the same time remain hopeful of <br>Allah's mercy. <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>28 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>33 <br>Ch. 1: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>29 <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyallaho anho) died of the <br>plague and, in the moments of death's agony, he fainted <br>many times. Whenever he regained consciousness for a <br>moment, he would say, \"Oh Allah! Thou knowest that I <br>love Thee. By Thy Honour and Glory, Thou knowest this <br>very well.\" Just before breathing his last, he said, \"0Death, <br>you are a welcome guest but have come at a time when <br>there is nothing in the .house to eat.\" Then he said, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou knowest very well that I always feared Thee, <br>and today I die hopeful of Thy forgiveness. 0 Allah! I en- <br>joyed life, not in digging canals and planting gardens, but <br>in remaining thirsty in the hot weather, in undergoing <br>hardships for the sake of Islaam, and in taking part in the <br>gatherings engaged in zikr under the supervision of the <br>lama.\" <br>Some Ulama have written that the fulfilment of expec- <br>tations promised by Almighty Allah in the aforesaid hadith <br>is in its most general sense. It carries assurance not only in <br>respect of forgiveness but also in respect of prayers, health, <br>wealth and safety. For instance when a person prays to <br>Allah and sincerely believes that Allah shall accept his <br>prayer, then his prayer is actually accepted, but if he has <br>doubt (that his prayer would not be accepted), it is not ac- <br>cepted. Thus, in another hadith it is stated that the prayer <br>of a person is granted so long as he does not say that his <br>prayer is not granted. The same is true in the case of all <br>blessings relating to health, prosperity, etc. According to <br>one hadith, if a destitute perssn discloses his hunger to <br>everybody, he is not relieved of his poverty, but if ,he <br>shows submission to Gracious Allah, his condition may <br>soon change for the better. However, hoping for the better <br>from Almighty Allah is one thing, and being over-confident <br>of His help and forgiveness is another thing. Almighty <br>Allah has warned us against such an attitude in several <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an e.g. <br>ij$\\ .A4.$3 yj <br>\"Let not the deceiver (the Satan) beguile you in regard <br>to Allah\" i.e. one should not be misled by the devil to <br>commit sins just because Allah is the most Merciful <br>and the Forgiver\". <br>There is another verse, <br>* , * + J , * I ; J + ~ \\ $  <br>\"Hath he knowledge of the Unseen, or hath he made a <br>pact with the Beneficent. No, never.\" <br>The second point in this hadith is \"Whenever a slave <br>of mine remembers Me, I am with him.\" In another hadith, <br>it is stated, \"So long as one's lips move in My remem- <br>brance I remain with him\" i.e. Almighty Allah bestows His <br>special care and mercy on him during all this time. <br>The third point is that Almighty Allah mentions him <br>with a favour to the angels, which signifies the value of <br>zikr. Firstly, this is because Allah created man such that in- <br>herently he is liable to be good as well as to go astray, as <br>given below in Hadith No. 8. Submission on his part there- <br>fore deserves special appreciation. Secondly, at the time of <br>Aadam's creation, the Angels (who have no instinct for <br>doing evil) could not understand the creation of man and <br>had contended that he would cause blood-shed and trouble <br>+<br>O <br>in the world, while they are always there to praise and <br>glorify Almighty Allah. Thirdly, man's worship of Allah 13 <br>5<br>and submission to His will is more commendable than that <br>of the Angels, because he does so on account of his faith in <br>the unseen which, however, is actually seen by the angels. <br>It is to this fact that Allah refers in the Holy Book: \"How <br>would man not have worshipped if he had actually seen <br>the Paradise and the Hell.\" It is for this reason that <br>Almighty Allah praises the noble deeds of those who <br>worship and glorify Him without seeing Him. <br>The fourth point contained in the above-mentioned <br>hadith is that if a man increases his devotion to Almighty <br>Allah, the increase in His mercy and kindness upon him is <br>proportionately far greater. \"Getting near\" and \"running\" <br>signify immediate increase in His blessings and mercy. <br>Thus, it is upto a person that, if he wants to enjoy more <br>kindness and favours from Almighty Allah, he should in- <br>crease his devotion to Him. <br>The fifth point in the above mentioned hadith is that <br>the Angels have been stated to be superior to man, while it <br>is commonly known that man is the best creation of Allah. <br>One reason for this,has already been explained in the trans- <br>lation (of the hadith), that the angels are superior because <br>they are innocent and are unable to commit sins. Secondly, <br>they are superior because they are better than the majority <br>of men, including even the majority of believers; arid yet <br>some selected Believers like the Prophets (Alaihimus <br>salaam) are superior to the angels. There are other reasons <br><br>30 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>as well, which are however left out in order to prevent the <br>discourse from getting too long. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>A Sahabi once said, \"0,Rasulullah, (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I know that the commandments of Sharee- <br>at am many, but of these tell me the one that I may <br>practise assiduously throughout my life.\" The Prophet, <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), replied, \"Keep ydUr <br>tongue always moist (i.e. busy) with the zikr of Allah.\" <br>According to another hadith, Harat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has said, \"Once at the time of my departure <br>from Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), I asked <br>him to advise me of that action which is most pleasing <br>to Almighty Allah: whereupon he replied, \"At the time <br>I <br>of your death, your tongue should be busy with zikr of <br>Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: By \"my departure\", Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) refers to the occasion when he was appointed <br>by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as the <br>Governor of Yemen and sent there for teaching and propa- <br>gating Islaam. It was at the time of that farewell that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given him some <br>parting instructions. <br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>31 <br>By saying that \"the commandments of Sharee-at are <br>many\", the Sahabi had meant that although observance of <br>every commandment is imperative, to specialize and attain <br>perfection in each and every one is difficult; and so he <br>wanted that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), may <br>recommend him something of over-riding importance <br>which he might hold fast to, and practise at all times and in <br>all conditions of sitting, standing or walking. <br>According to another hadith, a person who pos- <br>sesses the following four things is truly blessed, from <br>the worldly as well as spiritual point of view:- <br>(i) A tongue ever absorbed in the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah. <br>(ii) A heart filled with gratitude of Allah. <br>(iii) A body capable of undergoing hardships. <br>(iv) A wife who does not betray her husband's trust in <br>respect of her chastity and his wealth. <br>The phrase \"moist tongue\" according to some Ulama <br>means excessive utterance (of zikr) and, idiomatically, it is <br>used to convey excessive glorification and praise. But in <br>my (the author's) humble opinian it can have another <br>meaning as well. It is always very sweet and pleasant to <br>talk of one's beloved, as is the common feeling and experi- <br>ence of every lover. On this basis, the phrase \"moist <br>tongue\" would, therefore mean that one should glorify <br>with love the name of Almighty Allah, so as to feel love's <br>sweetness in the mouth. I have observed many times that <br>when some of my religious elders do zikr aloud, the flavour <br>of the sweetness enjoyed by them is so transmitted to the <br>listeners that their mouths also feel the sweetness and they <br>share the ecstasy likewise. But this phenomenon is poss- <br>ible only where there is a genuine yearning for zikr, and <br>the tongue is accustomed to excessive zikr. It is stated in <br>one hadith that the proof of one's love for Almighty Allah <br>lies in one's love for the zikr of Allah, and in the same way <br>lack of zikr betrays lack of attachment with Almighty <br>Allah. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) said that <br>those who keep their tongues wet with the zikr of Allah, <br>will snter paradise smiling. <br><br>32 <br>33 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>HadithNo. 3 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to <br>his companions, \"Shall I tell you of something that is <br>the best of all deeds, constitutes the best act of piety in <br>the eyes of your Lord, will elevate your status in the <br>Hereafter, and carries more virtue than the spending of <br>gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in <br>jihaad arid slayin or being slain in the path of Allah.\" <br>The Com anions egged to be informed of such an act. <br>The Prop Ret (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is <br>the zikr of Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: This hadith is a generalized statement; other- <br>wise, at times of specific need and emergency sadaqah <br>(charity) and jihaad (fighting in the path of Allah), etc., <br>become more desirable, as stated in some other ahaadith. <br>These acts become more important during the hour of <br>need, but the zikr is for all times and therefore generally <br>more important and virtuous. <br>According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said, \"for everything <br>there is a purifier or cleanser. (For instance, soap is used <br>for cleaning the body and the clothes, while a furnace is <br>used for purifying iron). The zikr of Almighty Allah <br>cleanses and purifies the heart, and provides the best pro- <br>tection against retribution in the Hereafter.\" This hadith <br>describes zikr as the purifier of the heart, and as such it <br>also established superiority of zikr over all other actions, <br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>because the value of every act of worship depends upon <br>ikhlaas (sincerity of the intention), which in turn depends <br>on the purity of heart. Therefore, according to some Sufis, <br>the zikr in this hadith implies the zikr of the heart as <br>against the zikr by the tongue. By the zikr of the heart, they <br>mean that the heart remains always conscious of, and in <br>communication with Almighty Allah. This state of the <br>heart is doubtless superior to all kinds of worship, because <br>when this state is attained, then omission of any kind of <br>worship is just not possible. All parts of the human body, <br>internal and external, are controlled by the heart and <br>submit completely to the Being to Whom the heart is at- <br>tached. The conduct of true lovers bears ample testimony <br>to this fact. <br>There are many more ahaadith that describe the <br>superiority of zikr over all other actions. Somebody en- <br>quired of Hazrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) as to what <br>action of man is most virtuous. He replied, \"Have you not <br>read in the Holy Qur'an, <br>(certainly the zikr of Allah is most exalted)?\" <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) had referred <br>here to the first ayat of Part 21 of the Holy Qur'an. The <br>author of \"Majaalisul Abraar\", while commenting on this <br>Hadith, has written that zikr of Allah is described to be su- <br>perior to sadaqah, jihaad, and all forms of worship, because <br>it is an end in itself, and ail types of worship constitute <br>only a means to achieve this end. zikr is of two kinds: one <br>is done by word of mouth and the other is in the form of <br>deep meditation and contemplation. It is the latter form of <br>zikr that is implied in the hadith which states that medita- <br>tion for one moment is better than doing worship for se- <br>venty years. Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) reported <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The <br>reward of the zikr of Allah is seven hundred thousand <br>times more than that for spending wealth in the path of <br>Allah.\" <br>Thus, in conclusion, it is evident that jihaad and sada- <br>qah, etc., assume more importance and become more virtu- <br>ous due to the need of the hour. The ahaadith which <br>describe their superiority are therefore understandable. For <br>instance, it is stated in one hadith that standing up for a <br>short while in the path of Allah is more valuable than offer- <br><br>34 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ing salaat at home for seventy years. Although salaat is <br>unanimously admitted to be the best form of worship, yet <br>taking part in jihaad at the time of an invasion by the infi- <br>dels carries far greater reward. <br>Hadith No.4 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), said, \"There <br>are many a people who do zikr of .Almighty Allah, <br>while lying comfortably in their soft beds, and for this, <br>they will be rewarded with the highest positions in <br>Paradise by Almighty Lord.\" <br>Note: ~ b n e r a l ~ ~ ,  <br>the greater the sufferings and hard- <br>ships one undergoes in the cause of religion, the higher <br>will be his status in the Hereafter. But the zikr of Allah is <br>such a blessed act that, even if it is done in soft beds in this <br>world, it will bring high rewards and elevated positions in <br>the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said, \"If you keep yourselves busy in zikr all the time, the <br>angels will shake hands with you in your beds as well as <br>on your way.\" <br>, <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"The mufarrideen have gone far ahead.\" \"Who are the mu- <br>farrideen?\" enquired the Sahabah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Those who are intensely de- <br>voted to the zikr of Allah.\" On the basis of this hadith, the <br>Sufis have stated that the kings and rulers should not be <br>prevented from zikr of Allah, for they, by this means, can <br>attain a lofty rank in the Hereafter. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Glorify <br>Almighty Allah during the time of prosperity and happi- <br>ness, and it will help you in times of distress and trouble \" <br>-<br>1-ladhrat Salmaan Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If a <br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>35 <br>person remembers Allah in times of peace, pleasure and <br>prosperity, then whenever he is in trouble and difficulty, <br>the angels, being familiar with his voice, recognise him in <br>his helplessness and intercede before Almighty Allah (for <br>his forgiveness); but, if one who does not remember Allah <br>in his time of pleasure and happens to pray for help at the <br>time of difficulty, the angels find his voice to be quite un- <br>familiar and therefore do not intercede for him.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"Para- <br>dise has eight gates, one of which is exclusively reserved <br>for those who are engaged in zikr.\" It is said in one hadith, <br>\"A person who constantly does zikr of Allah is immune <br>from hypocrisy in faith\", and according to another hadith, <br>\"He is loved by Almighty Allah.\" <br>Once during his return journey to Madina Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Where are those who <br>2<br>have gone ahead.\" The Companions said, \"The fast travel- <br>g & <br>lers have gone ahead\": then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe 8<br>wasallam) said, \"Those who remain ahead are the persons <br>who remain constantly absorbed in zikr. Whoever desires <br>to enjoy himself in Paradise, should do zikr of Allah ex- <br>cessively.\" <br>Hadith No 5 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The <br>contrast between a person who glorifies Almighty <br>Allah and one who does not remember Him is like that <br>between the living and the dead.\" <br>Note: <br>Life is dear to all, and every one fears death. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) meant to say that one <br>who does not remember Allah, though bodily alive, is <br>spiritually dead and his life is but worthless. A Persian <br>couplet quoted here by the author means, <br>\"(The lover says) My life (of loneliness) is no life; his is the <br>life who lives in contact with the beloved.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that the example refers to the <br>condition of the heart: the heart that remembers Allah is <br>really alive, while the one that does not, is described as <br><br>36 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i <br>dead. Some scholars say that the contrast is in respect of <br>gain and loss. A man who harasses a zaakir is like one har- <br>assing a living being, and he will be avenged for this har- <br>assment and will suffer for it. One who ill-treats the <br>neglectful, ill-treats a dead body, which cannot avenge <br>itself. Some Sufis say that the hadith refers to the eternal <br>life of the zaakireen, because those who glorify Allah con- <br>stantly with sincerity never really die, but instead remain <br>spiritually alive even after passing away from this world. <br>The zaakireen also enjoy a special life after death, like the <br>martyrs, mentioned in a verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Nay, they are alive in the eyes of their Sustainer. <br>Hakiem Tirmizi writes, \"Zikr moistens the heart and <br>softens it. A heart that is devoid of zikr becomes dry and <br>hard, due to the excessive heat of lust and base desires. All <br>parts of the body likewise become stiff and abstain from <br>submission to Allah; if you try to bend them, they break <br>like a dry piece of wood, which can be used as firewood <br>only. <br>Hadith No. 6 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"If a person has a lot of wealth and distrib- <br>utes it amongst the needy, while another person is <br>only busy with the zikr of Allah, the latter, who is en- <br>gaged in zikr, is the better of the two.\" <br>Note: <br>Spending in the path of Allah is a splendid virtue, but <br>zikr of Allah is more virtuous. How lucky are those well-to- <br>do persons who, in addition to spending for the pleasure of <br>Allah, remain also devoted to His zikr. <br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>37 <br>According to one hadith, Almighty Allah also gives sa- <br>daqah every day, i.e. He showers His favours on the eople, <br>and everybody gets what he deserves, but the luc Eiest is <br>the person who is favoured with the ability to do His zikr. <br>People who are engaged in different occupations, such as <br>trade, farming and service, should spare some time for zikr <br>every day and thereby earn great rewards. It should not be <br>difficult to devote an hour or two out of 24 hours, exclus- <br>ively for this noble purpose. <br>A lot of our time is wasted in frivolous pursuits, and <br>some of this can be easily spared for this most useful work. <br>In another hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"The wisest of all people are <br>those who keep track of time, with the help of the sun, the <br>moon, the stars, and the shadows, for doing zikr regularly.\" <br>Nowadays we can determine time with the help of <br>* <br>watches, yet one should be able to judge time with the help <br>92 <br>of these natural agents, so that no time gets wasted in case <br>5<br>the watch stops or goes out of order. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the place where zikr is done, takes pride over <br>other parts of the earth. <br>Hadith No. 7 <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Those who are admitted into Paradise will not regret <br>over anything of this world, except the time spent <br>without zikr in their life.\" <br>Note: <br>After their entry into Paradise, when they will see the <br>huge reward (as large as mountains) for remembering Allah <br>once, they will feel extremely sorry over their loss caused <br>by the time spent without zikr, as can be well imagined. In <br>this world, there are such blessed persons who would not <br><br></p></div>"

I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br><br>0 <br>22 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of ~ a r d s h i ~ s  23 <br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br><br>24 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>26 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>27 <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br><br>28 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br><br></p></div>"

In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br><br></p></div>"

When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>27 <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br><br>28 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br><br></p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br>0,<br>13 <br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br><br>14 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br><br>34 <br>16 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>2 <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>17 / <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br><br>18 <br>19 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br><br>20 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br><br>0 <br>22 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of ~ a r d s h i ~ s  23 <br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br><br>24 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>26 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>27 <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br><br>28 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>30 <br>31 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse: <br>\"Lo! I, indeed I am Alfah. There is none worthy of <br>worship savz Me. So serve me and establish Salaat for <br>My remembrance.\" <br>He said: \"Alright, take me to Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came out from insidwand said: <br>\"0,'Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday (on Thurs- <br>day night) the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>prayed to Allah, '0,Allah strengthen Islam with either <br>'Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest'. It seems <br>that his prayer has been answered in your favour.\" <br>'Umar then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and embraced Islam on Friday morning. 'Umar's Islam <br>was a terrible blow to the morale of the unbelievers, but <br>still the Muslims were few in number and the whole coun- <br>try was against them. The disbelievers intensified ,their <br>efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims and the <br>extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on <br>their side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new, <br>and returned to their country. On approaching Mecca, they <br>learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions wen: <br>going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to <br>Abyssinia and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protec- <br>tion of a few inflyential people. This is known as the first <br>migration to Abyssinia. Later on, a bigger group of eighty- <br>three men and eighteen women emigrated to Abyssinia <br>(separately). This is called the second emigration to that <br>country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. <br>The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought <br>of peace enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They <br>sent a delegation to Abyssinia with handsome presents for <br>the king, his courtiers and the clergy. The delegation first <br>met the chiefs and the priests and, by offering them pres- <br>ents, succeeded in winning the court officials to their side. <br>Having thus made their way to the royal court, they pros- <br>trated themselves before the king and then presenting the <br>gifts put their case before him. They &id: <br>\"0,king! A few foolish lads of our community have re- <br>nounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an <br>absolutely new religion, which is opposed to'our as <br>well as your religions. They have come and-settled in <br>your country. The nobility of Mecca, their own parents <br><br>32 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they <br>could make to the charges brought against them. Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) rose and addressed the king thus: <br>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither <br>knew Allah nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped <br>stones. We used to eat carrion and commit all sorts of <br>undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did not make <br>good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among <br>us would thrive,at the expense of the weak. Till at last, <br>Allah raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>our reformation. His noble descent, up-right conduct, <br>integrity of purpose, and pure life are only too well <br>known amongst us. He called upon us to worship Al- <br>lah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone- <br>worship. He enjoined upon us right conduct, and for- <br>bade us from indecency. He taught us to tell the truth, <br>to make good our trust, to have regard for our kith and <br>kin, and to do good to our neighbours. From him we <br>learnt to observe Salaat. Fasting, Zakaat and good con- <br>duct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid blood- <br>shed. He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, <br>misappropriating the orphan's heritage, bringing false <br>accusations against others, and all other indecent <br>things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, the won- <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>33 <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\" <br>and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no <br>means hand over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed <br>and disgraced, they held a counsel. One of them said: <br>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's <br>wrath upon their heads.\" <br>Although the others did not agree to sukh a drastic step (for <br>after all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would <br>not listen. The next day, they excited the king by telling <br>him that those heretics denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) <br>and did not believe in his Divinity. The Muslims were <br>again summoned to the court. They were much more dis- <br>tressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief <br>in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam). they said: <br>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him to <br>our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a <br>servant and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which <br>He conveyed to the virgin and pure Maryam.\" <br>Negus said: \"'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does :not say <br>anything beyond that.\" <br>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king <br>would not listen to them. He returned to the de1t:gatioil the <br><br>34 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br></p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>37 <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br><br>33 <br>38 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>the musjid.\" \t<br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br><br></p></div>"

You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br><br>42 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>43 <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br><br>44 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness. <br>This is to meditate over the greatness of Allah. If this is <br>done, it becomes very easy- to perform all other acts of <br>righteousness with full sincerity. Is it so very difficult to <br>devote a few minutes, out of the twenty four hours of a day <br>at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation? <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passing <br>near the ruins of Thamud during Tabuk expedition: <br>The Tabuk expedition is one of the major campaigns of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and the last one <br>in which he personally took part. When he received the <br>news that the Caesar (of Rome) had mustered a large force <br>to crush the power of Islam and was on his way (through <br>Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah <br>to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 <br>A.H., the devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the <br>weather was hot and the fighting was expected to be very <br>tough. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made an <br>open declaration that the Muslims should gather in <br>strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman <br>Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the <br>equipment of the expedition. It was on this occasion that <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>45 <br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>4<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not even <br>dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on ac- <br>count of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. <br>Except the women, children (who were excusable), those <br>who were ordered to stay behind by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, nearly every- <br>body joined the expedition. Also among those left behind <br>were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for <br>themselves, nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) able to provide them with any. It is about such people <br>that Allah says in his Book: <br>\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in <br>sorrow that they could not find means to spend.\" <br>(IX:92) <br>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any <br>excuse whatsoever were three in number. Their story <br>would be presently related. On their way to Syria when the <br>expedition reached the habitat ion of Tharnud, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his face with his shirt <br>and quickened the pace of his camel. He also instructed the <br><br>46 <br>4 \t<br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>4 7<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying: <br>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" <br>Allah's reply to thie was: <br>(*\\ $9)I> bi *ju ji <br>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\" <br>From amongst the .f&thful, there were only three persons <br>who failed to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura- <br>rah bin Rabi, Hilal MR Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Rad- <br>hipallaho anhum). Murarah had orchards of dates, laden <br>with fruit. He pershaded himself to lag behind with the <br>piea: <br>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What <br>possible harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this <br>one?\" <br>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this <br>prevented him from going out. But when he realised his <br>folly, he gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, <br>too, that had caused him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's case was different. Some <br>of his kinsfolk who had been away for a long time had just <br>returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their company <br>that he did not join the expedition. He also had partici- <br>pated in all the campaigns previously and thought (like <br>Murarah) that it would not matter much if he missed just <br>that one campaign. When he came to know of the serious- <br>ness of his default, he made up his mind to sever all his <br>connections with those relatives who had been the cause of <br>that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, <br>which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says: <br>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at the <br>time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had <br>never possessed this number before. It was a habit with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never <br>disclosed the destination of his expeditions, but he <br>would k e e ~  <br>enquiring about the conditions prevailing <br>elsewhere. But this time in view of the distance, the <br>hot season, and the strength of the enemy, he had de- <br>clared his destination, so that preparations could be <br>made thorough and complete. The number of the par- <br>ticipants was so large that it was difficult to note down <br>their names even, so much so, that absentees could <br>hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of <br>Madinah were full of fruit. I intended every morning to <br>make preparation for the journey but, somehow or <br>other, the days passed by and I made no progress. I <br>was satisfied that I had all the necessary means at my <br>disposal and that I would be ready in no time if I once <br>did decide to do so. I was still in this state of indeci- <br>sion when I learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho daihe <br>wasallam) had left with his companions. The idea still <br>lingered in my mind that I would take a day or two to <br>get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination <br>continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in <br>Tabuk drew very near. I then tried to get ready but <br>again, somehow or other, I did not do so. Now, when I <br>came to look at the people left behind, I realised that <br>there was none in Madinah except those who had been <br>condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially <br>exempted from going for certain reasons. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk in-<br>quired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' <br>Somebody said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in <br>wealth and ease has caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az <br><br>48 <br>Stories of the ~ a h a a b a h  <br>4 <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>49 <br>interrupted and said, No, this is wrong. As far as our <br>knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's <br>return. I was struck with grief and remorse. Good ex- <br>cuses one after the other entered my mind, and I was <br>sure that I could escape the Prophet's wrath with one <br>of them for the time being, and later on I could pray for <br>forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice of the wise <br>men of my family in the matter. But when I knew that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had actually <br>arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth <br>would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain <br>truth. It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that whenever he returned from a journey <br>he would repair to the musjid, first of all, say two <br>rakaat 'Tahiyyatul musjid' and then stay there for a <br>while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in the <br>musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on <br>solemn oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany <br>him on the campaign. He took them at their words, <br>leaving the rest to Allah. Just then I came and greeted <br>him with 'salaam'. He turned his face with a sardonic <br>smile. I besought him with the words: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! You turn your face from me. By Allah! I am <br>neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my <br>faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. He then <br>said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had <br>you not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly <br>man, I am sure I would escape his displeasure through <br>(seemingly) reasonable excuses, for Allah has endowed <br>me with the gift of the gab. But in your case I am sure <br>that if 1 appease you with a false statement, Allah <br>would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, <br>I am sure that if I displease you by confessing the <br>simple truth, then Allah would very soon blow away <br>your displeasure. I, therefore, make bold to speak the <br>very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all. I had never <br>been so we11 to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking <br>the truth.' He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will <br>decide about you. When I left the musjid, many a man <br>of my clan blamed me and admonished me thus; <br>'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after <br>making some good excuse for once, you had requested <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pray for <br>your goodness, surely his prayer would have sufficed <br>you.' I inquired of them if there were any more people <br>like me. They informed me that there were two other <br>persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, <br>who also had admitted their faults like me and re-<br>ceived the same reply from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I knew that both of them were very <br>good Muslims and had participated in the campaign of <br>Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) issued <br>instructions that none was to speak with the three of <br>us.' <br>It is a cqmmon principle that displeasure is shbwn <br>where some attachment exists, and a reprimand is given <br>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incor- <br>rigible person would be a futile effort. <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho<br>alaihe wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted <br>us. Nobody was prepared to mix with or even speak to <br>us. It seemed as if I was living in a strange land alto- <br>gether. My own birth-place looked like a foreign local- <br>ity and my bosom friends behaved like strangers. 'The <br>earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur'an IX: <br>113)for me. The thing that worried me most was that, <br>if I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not lead my funeral prayer, <br>and if the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) died in <br>the meantime, I would be doomed for ever, with none <br>to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. The <br>other two companions of mine confined themselves to <br>their houses. I was the most daring of the three: I <br>would go to the market, and join the Jamaat for Salaat, <br>but nobody would talk to me. I would approach the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say 'Assa- <br>lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his <br>lips moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete <br>the Salaat by standing close to him, and I would look <br>at him from the corner of my eye to learn if he ever <br>cast a single glance at me. I noticed that when I was <br><br></p></div>"

If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>37 <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br><br>33 <br>38 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>the musjid.\" \t<br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br><br>40 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br><br>42 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>43 <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br><br></p></div>"
