            "content": "Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad-<br><br>10<br>my life. You know that I have always <br>loved Thee. Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me I<br><br>11<br>in the wording, recited each Hadith before Imam Bukhari <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). On each recital, he would say: <br>\"1 do not know such Hadith.\" <br>When all had finished, he addressed each man saying: <br>\"Brother, the first Hadith you recited as such (reciting <br>as the man had done), but actually it is such (reciting <br>the correct wording) . . .and so on.\" <br>He repeated all the hundred Ahadith first in the form in <br>which those men had recited, and again in the correct form <br>in that very order. <br>Imam Muslim (Rahmatullah alaih) started learning <br>Hadith when he was fourteen, and remained engaged in <br>that till his death. He says: <br>\"I have compiled my book of <br>from 300 000 Ahadith.\" <br>12 000 after selecting <br>Abu Daud (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I had collected 500 000 Ahadith, but I selected only <br>4 800 f<br>i<br>l<br>i<br>i<br>b<br>k \"<br><br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Ch<br>t<br>VIII Z<br>l f<br>k<br>l d<br><br>2 <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town<br><br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh accepting their conditions in full<br><br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>h )<br>d hi<br>h i<br>b<br>k<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah<br><br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>h<br>h<br>h<br>f b<br>i<br>h<br>P<br>h '<br>i<br>H<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of ~ a r d s h i ~ s  23 <br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing<br><br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand.

When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah!

He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was<br><br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore \" 'But I am taking them by<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said:<br><br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse:<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new,<br><br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>33 <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\"<br><br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>h<br>Q<br>h<br>h<br>f<br>d<br>id d<br>l<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said,<br><br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah:<br><br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and<br><br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam:<br><br>Ch.

The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), on the death of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>f<br>f H dh<br>t Ai h h (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h ) b t I<br><br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>45 <br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>4<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>i<br>l<br>f h<br>'<br>b<br>h<br>ld<br><br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying:<br><br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>d<br>l<br>f<br>h<br>Ch i i<br>Ki<br>f<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>itti<br>th<br>f f<br>h<br>t i k<br>ith<br>i f<br>d<br><br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives<br><br>"

            "content": "11<br>in the wording, recited each Hadith before Imam Bukhari <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). On each recital, he would say: <br>\"1 do not know such Hadith.\" <br>When all had finished, he addressed each man saying: <br>\"Brother, the first Hadith you recited as such (reciting <br>as the man had done), but actually it is such (reciting <br>the correct wording) . . .and so on.\" <br>He repeated all the hundred Ahadith first in the form in <br>which those men had recited, and again in the correct form <br>in that very order. <br>Imam Muslim (Rahmatullah alaih) started learning <br>Hadith when he was fourteen, and remained engaged in <br>that till his death. He says: <br>\"I have compiled my book of <br>from 300 000 Ahadith.\" <br>12 000 after selecting <br>Abu Daud (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I had collected 500 000 Ahadith, but I selected only <br>4 800 f<br>i<br>l<br>i<br>i<br>b<br>k \"<br><br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Ch<br>t<br>VIII Z<br>l f<br>k<br>l d<br><br>2 <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town<br><br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh accepting their conditions in full<br><br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>h )<br>d hi<br>h i<br>b<br>k<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah<br><br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>h<br>h<br>h<br>f b<br>i<br>h<br>P<br>h '<br>i<br>H<br><br>Ch.

His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing<br><br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0 P<br>h t<br>f All h! B Hi<br>h<br>i th<br>t<br>f<br><br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>t hi<br>h l<br>lif<br>i<br>t i i<br>d<br>ff<br>i<br>f<br>I l<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>27 <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was<br><br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore \" 'But I am taking them by<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said:<br><br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse:<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new,<br><br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>33 <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\"<br><br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>h<br>Q<br>h<br>h<br>f<br>d<br>id d<br>l<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said,<br><br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah:<br><br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and<br><br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam:<br><br>Ch.

We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>f<br>f H dh<br>t Ai h h (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h ) b t I<br><br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>45 <br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>4<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>i<br>l<br>f h<br>'<br>b<br>h<br>ld<br><br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying:<br><br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>d<br>l<br>f<br>h<br>Ch i i<br>Ki<br>f<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>itti<br>th<br>f f<br>h<br>t i k<br>ith<br>i f<br>d<br><br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>53 <br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me you will see how I<br><br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse:<br><br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse:<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear<br><br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that when he wept he smeared his tears over<br><br>"

Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next.

See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>5<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>5 <br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>d<br>i<br>h<br>i h<br>hi<br>if<br>d hi<br>ki<br>i h<br><br>5 <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"Wh<br>Ab<br>B k (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>l<br>d<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali.

One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah!

'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when<br><br>Their number varied with time. But at this particular <br>juncture, they mustered seventy in all. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>d<br>d<br>h<br>ill<br>ll<br>f<br>h<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>l<br>f<br>f<br>th<br>th f All h It i<br>id i H dith<br><br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con-<br><br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>1 <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying.

Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallahoanho) remarked:<br><br>6<br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder<br><br>6 \t<br>Ch. IV:Piety and Scrupulousness <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else ' This brother is his<br><br>6 <br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>8 <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) She<br><br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\"<br><br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to<br><br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"Ma<br>Allah ha e merc<br>on o ! The child's life<br>as in<br><br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once<br><br>Ch.

He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning.

They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations Allah<br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise. I would rather join my martyred brothers than go <br>alive with you.\" <br>He then refused to follow them in captivity. They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then. The two re- <br>maining captives were taken by them to Mecca and sold to<br><br>The Qureysh simply could not understand this reply, and <br>Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"There is absolutely no parallel, anywhere in the <br>world, to the love that the companions of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bear him.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was then martyred. <br>Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the <br>captivity of Hujair for a long time. A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing<br><br>7 <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too).<br><br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight When we sit at the meal<br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>99 <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she camel in stead; which he refused to accept<br><br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) trying to emulate <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>for contributions in the path of Allah. In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam):<br><br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it she simply exclaimed<br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>103 <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of<br><br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\"<br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with<br><br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse,<br><br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I:<br>'I did not forget you instructions but thought it better<br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br><br>8<br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then.

By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money<br><br>8 <br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual.<br><br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2<br>HadhratAli's (Radhiyallahoanho)valour in Uhud:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both \"<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>er m ch to join the battle People said to him:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud,<br><br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam In the battle of<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind<br><br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\"<br><br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better<br><br>"

He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons.

He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need.

By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money<br><br>8 <br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual.<br><br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2<br>HadhratAli's (Radhiyallahoanho)valour in Uhud:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both \"<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>er m ch to join the battle People said to him:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud,<br><br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam In the battle of<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind<br><br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\"<br><br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>123 <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhi allaho<br><br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time I<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>l h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>ll<br>h<br>h<br><br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred We have never<br><br>9 <br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>0 <br>I<br>0<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings,<br><br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem-<br><br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path.<br><br>"

The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both \"<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>er m ch to join the battle People said to him:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud,<br><br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam In the battle of<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind<br><br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\"<br><br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>123 <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhi allaho<br><br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time I<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>l h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>ll<br>h<br>h<br><br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred We have never<br><br>9 <br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>0 <br>I<br>0<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings,<br><br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem-<br><br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path.<br><br>"

Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me I<br><br>11<br>in the wording, recited each Hadith before Imam Bukhari <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). On each recital, he would say: <br>\"1 do not know such Hadith.\" <br>When all had finished, he addressed each man saying: <br>\"Brother, the first Hadith you recited as such (reciting <br>as the man had done), but actually it is such (reciting <br>the correct wording) . . .and so on.\" <br>He repeated all the hundred Ahadith first in the form in <br>which those men had recited, and again in the correct form <br>in that very order. <br>Imam Muslim (Rahmatullah alaih) started learning <br>Hadith when he was fourteen, and remained engaged in <br>that till his death. He says: <br>\"I have compiled my book of <br>from 300 000 Ahadith.\" <br>12 000 after selecting <br>Abu Daud (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I had collected 500 000 Ahadith, but I selected only <br>4 800 f<br>i<br>l<br>i<br>i<br>b<br>k \"<br><br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Ch<br>t<br>VIII Z<br>l f<br>k<br>l d<br><br>2 <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town<br><br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh accepting their conditions in full<br><br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>h )<br>d hi<br>h i<br>b<br>k<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah<br><br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>h<br>h<br>h<br>f b<br>i<br>h<br>P<br>h '<br>i<br>H<br><br>Ch.

His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing<br><br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0 P<br>h t<br>f All h!

When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho).

He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was<br><br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore \" 'But I am taking them by<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>29 <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said:<br><br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse:<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new,<br><br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>33 <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\"<br><br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>h<br>Q<br>h<br>h<br>f<br>d<br>id d<br>l<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said,<br><br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah:<br><br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and<br><br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them.

How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam:<br><br>Ch.

We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah!

Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>i<br>l<br>f h<br>'<br>b<br>h<br>ld<br><br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying:<br><br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>d<br>l<br>f<br>h<br>Ch i i<br>Ki<br>f<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>itti<br>th<br>f f<br>h<br>t i k<br>ith<br>i f<br>d<br><br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>53 <br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me you will see how I<br><br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse:<br><br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse:<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear<br><br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that when he wept he smeared his tears over<br><br>ABSTENENCE AND SELF-DENIAL OF THE SAHABAH <br>Page No. <br>The Prophet's dislike for gold ................... <br>60 <br>The Prophet's life of abstinence ................. <br>60 <br>Abu Hurairah in state of hunger ................. <br>62 <br>Abu Bakr's daily allowance frbm Baitul-ma1 ...... <br>63 <br>Umar's daily allowance from Baitul-ma1 ......... <br>65 <br>Bilal's story about the Prophet .................. <br>67 <br>Another story of Abu Hurairah's hunger .......... <br>69 <br>The Prophet's opinion about two persons ........ <br>70 <br>Privations go with love forthe Prophet ........... <br>71 <br>The Al-Ambar Expedition ...................... <br>72<br><br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter? Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next. I implored him: '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! Ask forgiveness for me. I was really <br>in the wrong\" <br>Look at the household effects of the sovereign in this <br>world and in the hereafter, and the beloved Prophet of <br>Allah. See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>5<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>5 <br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>d<br>i<br>h<br>i h<br>hi<br>if<br>d hi<br>ki<br>i h<br><br>5 <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"Wh<br>Ab<br>B k (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>l<br>d<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali. Hadhrat <br>Usman Hadhrat Zubair and Hadhrat Talhah (Radhivallaho<br><br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What was the best of food that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) ever took at your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Simple barley bread was the only food we used to <br>take. One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah!

III: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 67 <br>He allowed him in and invited him to share the food with <br>him. 'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when<br><br>Their number varied with time. But at this particular <br>juncture, they mustered seventy in all. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>d<br>d<br>h<br>ill<br>ll<br>f<br>h<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>l<br>f<br>f<br>th<br>th f All h It i<br>id i H dith<br><br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con-<br><br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>1 <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'The flesh nourished by haraam food, is des- <br>ti<br>d f<br>th<br>fi<br>f H ll ' I th<br>f<br>d<br>h<br>t<br>t<br><br>w <br>Ch.

They could <br>.c2~<br>not dare taking anything that was 'haraam', which is so <br>usual these days. <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Bait-ul-Maal: <br>Ibn-Seereen writes: <br>\"When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he said to his daughter, Hadhrat Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), 'I did not like to take anything <br>from the Bait-ul-Maal, but Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) insisted on it, to relieve me of my occupation, <br>and to enable me to devote nly full time to the duties <br>of the 'Khilafat: and I was left no choice. Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallahoanho) remarked:<br><br>6<br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder<br><br>6 \t<br>Ch. IV:Piety and Scrupulousness <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else ' This brother is his<br><br>6 <br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>8 <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) She<br><br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\"<br><br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to<br><br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"Ma<br>Allah ha e merc<br>on o ! The child's life<br>as in<br><br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once<br><br>Ch.

He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning.

They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations Allah<br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise. I would rather join my martyred brothers than go <br>alive with you.\" <br>He then refused to follow them in captivity. They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then. The two re- <br>maining captives were taken by them to Mecca and sold to<br><br>The Qureysh simply could not understand this reply, and <br>Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"There is absolutely no parallel, anywhere in the <br>world, to the love that the companions of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bear him.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was then martyred. <br>Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the <br>captivity of Hujair for a long time. A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing<br><br>7 <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too).<br><br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight When we sit at the meal<br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>99 <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she camel in stead; which he refused to accept<br><br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) trying to emulate <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>for contributions in the path of Allah. In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam):<br><br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it she simply exclaimed<br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>103 <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of<br><br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\"<br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with<br><br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse,<br><br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I:<br>'I did not forget you instructions but thought it better<br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br><br>8<br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity<br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch.

I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money<br><br>8 <br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual.<br><br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2<br>HadhratAli's (Radhiyallahoanho)valour in Uhud:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both \"<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame.

There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud,<br><br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam In the battle of<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind<br><br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\"<br><br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>123 <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhi allaho<br><br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time I<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>l h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>ll<br>h<br>h<br><br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred We have never<br><br>9 <br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>0 <br>I<br>0<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings,<br><br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem-<br><br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path.<br><br>IJbayy bin Kaab, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Hadhrat <br>Ma'aaz bin Jabal, Hadhrat Ammaar bin Yaasir, Hadhrat Hu- <br>zaifah, Hadhrat Salman Farsi, Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit, <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum). <br>To give Fatwa during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) was a big privilege for these Saha- <br>bah, and speaks of their deep and dependable knowledge. <br>2. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) burns his col- <br>lections: <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"My father (Hadhrat Abu Bakr) (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had a collection of five hundred Hadiths. One night I <br>noticed that he was very restless. He was tossing about <br>in the bed and could not sleep. I got worried over this <br>and inquired, 'Are you suffering from any trouble or <br>worried about anything.' But he did not speak and re- <br>mained restless throughout the night. Next morning he <br>called me and said 'Bring the collection of Hadith that<br><br>\"These teachings are very fine and these verses are <br>simply beautiful. How do you admit a person to your <br>faith?\" <br>He said: \t \"You take a bath, put on clean clothes and recite <br>the Kalimah.\" <br>Usaid immediately complied with all these formalities and <br>embraced Islam. He then went to Sa'd and brought him to <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) to listen to his Tabligh. Sa'd <br>also embraced Islam. No sooner had Sa'd accepted Islam <br>than he went to people of his clan (Banu Ash-hal) and said <br>to them: <br>\"What type of person do you think I am?\" <br>They replied: \"You are the best and the noblest of <br>clan.\" <br>the <br>He then said: \"I have vowed not to talk to your men and <br>women until you all embrace Islam and be- <br>lieve in Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe was- <br>sallam).\" <br>All th<br>d<br>f B<br>A h h 1<br>b<br>d I l<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>He used \t to finish the Qur'an once in Tahajjud in eight <br>nights. Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassalam) said <br>to him: <br>\"Allah has commanded me to recite the Qur'an to <br>you.\" <br>He said: \t \"0, Prophet of Allah! Did Allah mention me by <br>my name?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Yes, He mentioned you by your name.\" <br>Tears began to roll down his cheeks with excessive joy. <br>Hadhrat Jundub bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When I went to Madinah to acquire knowledge, I <br>found that people were sitting in groups, and each <br>group wag entrusted to a teacher. In one of the groups I <br>saw a person teaching Hadith, clad in two sheets of <br>cloth and looking like a traveller. I asked the people, <br>'Who is this person?' They said, 'He is our esteemed <br>Imam, Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho).'<br><br>F <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He remarked, 'I also thought that it <br>was he.\" <br>In spite of his devotion to knowledge and his special <br>job of writing the Qur'an, he took part in all the battles by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He did <br>not miss a single campaign or expedition led by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Huzaifah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Anxiety Re- <br>garding Tribulations. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the <br>well-known Sahabah. He is known as 'Keeper of Secrets.' <br>The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) had confided to <br>him the names of Munafiqin, and had informed him in <br>1<br>chronological order all the tribulations which the Muslims <br>were to face till the last day. He gave him full details (viz. <br>the name of the mischief maker, his parents' names, his <br>community, etc.) about the incidents that were going to <br>affect three hundred or more people. Hadhrat Huzaifah <br>(Radhiyallahoanho)says:<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>TheProphet: \t \"Yes, good will come again, but the hearts <br>of the people will not be so clear as before.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"And will there by any evil coming after <br>this good?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes, There will be such persons who will <br>misguide the people and take them to Hell.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"What should I do if I witness that time?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"If there be a group of Muslims united <br>under one Amir, then join them, otherwise <br>dissociate yourself from all such factions <br>and be secluded in a corner, or take refuge <br>under a tree (i.e., in the forest) and be there <br>till you die.\" <br>As the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had dis- <br>closed to him the identities of the Munafiqin of that time, <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to ask him: <br>\"Is there any Munafiq among my deputies?\" <br>Heonce replied:<br>\"Yes. There is one, but I shall not dis-<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>0 <br>\"A person participating in a funeral gets one Qeeraat of <br>reward if he returns after the funeral service, but gets <br>two Qeeraats of reward if he remains there till the <br>burial is over, and one Qeeraat is weightier than mount <br>Uhud.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) heard <br>this and doubted authenticity of the Hadith, saying: <br>\"0.Abu Hurairah! Think before you speak.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) got upset over <br>this and took Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to Hadhrat 'Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), and said to <br>her: <br>\"0,Ummul-Mo'minin, I request you to say by Allah if <br>you have beard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) the Hadith regarding Qeeraats of reward?\" <br>She said: \"Yes. I have heard this Hadith.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) then said to <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho):<br><br>10 \t<br>laho alaihe wasallam). After the death of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), people of the weak faith, <br>especially among wandering Arabs, began to desert Islam <br>and become renegades. Musailamah took advantage of the <br>situation and succeeded in causing a large number of <br>people to fall a prey to his seduction. Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) decided to put a stop to this onslaught on Islam. <br>A fierce battle was fought with him, in which the Muslims <br>triumphed with the help of Allah, and Musailamah was <br>killed. A good number of Sahabah, including many Huffaz, <br>however, lost their lives. After this battle, Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and said: <br>\"Many Huffaz gave been slain in this battle. I am afraid <br>we are likely to lose a good portion of the Qur'an if we <br>fight a few more battles and suffer loss of Hufaaz at <br>this rate. I, therefore, suggest that the Qur'an may be <br>compiled and preserved in the form of one complete <br>book.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho)remarked:<br><br>only person whom I can safely appoint as an Amir <br>without consulting anybody.\" <br>He was permitted by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to visit him at all times. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>(1) \"If you want to recite the Qur'an as it was revealed <br>to me, then copy the recitation of Abdullah bin <br>Mas'ood.\" <br>(2) \t \"Believe in what Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>iaho anho) narrates about me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Moosa Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>mother visited the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) house so often and were so at home there that the <br>people of Yemen, who had come to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), took him as one of the <br>Ahlul Bait (family member.)\" Though he was so near <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), yet he was <br>ti<br>b<br>t<br>ti<br>th<br>d<br>f th P<br>h t<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"A person who attributes anything to me, which I have <br>not said, is making his abode in the Hell.\" <br>This is why the Sahabah, though speaking and doing every- <br>thing according to the instructions and example of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), were afraid of attribu- <br>ting any words to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>lest they should be different from what the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) had actually uttered. On the other <br>hand, we go on quoting Ahadith without being sure of their <br>authenticity and fear not the serious consequences of at- <br>tributing wrongly anything to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). It may be mentioned that the Fiqah.Hani- <br>fiyah is based mostly on the Ahadith narrated by Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>A Person Travels from Madinah to Damascus For One <br>Hadith. <br>Kathir bin Qais narrates: <br>\"I was sitting with Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho<br><br>one who traverses some distance to seek knowledge. <br>The angels spread their wings under his feet, and all <br>things in heavens and earth (even the fish in the water) <br>pray for his forgiveness. The superiority of a person <br>possessing knowledge over a person doing worship is <br>as the superiority of the moon over the stars. The <br>Ulama are the inheritors of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wassallam). The legacy of Prophets (Alaihimus- <br>salaam) is neither gold nor silver. Their legacy is <br>knowledge. A person who acquires knowledge ac-<br>quires a great wealth.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu-Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) is foremost <br>among the Sahabah who possessed very sound knowledge <br>in religion. He is called 'Hakim-ul-Ummah' (The Sage of <br>Islam). He once said: <br>\"Before Islam, I lived on trade. After accepting Islam, I <br>tried to combine the service of Allah with my business, <br>but I could not do so. I therefore gave up business and <br>devoted myself solely to the service of Allah. Now if I <br>have a shop at the gate of a musjid and have no fear of <br>l<br>i<br>i<br>l<br>S l<br>h<br>b<br>d<br>if<br>h<br>h<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"For each Hadith that I have learnt, I had to travel on <br>foot for days and nights together.\" <br>Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullahi alaih) was born in Shawwal <br>194 A.H. He started learning Hadith in 205 A.H. i.e., when <br>he was only eleven. He had memorised all the books writ- <br>ten by Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullahi alaih) while <br>he was in his early teens. After collecting Ahadith from all <br>the learned men of his own locality, he set out in 216 A.H. <br>in search of further knowledge. His father died and he <br>could not leave his widowed mother alone. He therefore <br>took her with him on his long and strenuous journey to <br>Balkh, Baghdad, Mecca, Basra, Koofah, Asqalan, Hims and <br>Damascus. He collected all the available Ahadith from <br>these seats of learning. He was accepted as an expert in <br>Hadith, while he had not a single hair on his chin. He <br>writes: <br>I was eighteen when I compiled the Fatwah of the Sa- <br>habah and Tabi'ees.\" <br>Hashad (Rahmatullahi alaihe) and one of his companions <br>say:-<br><br>supposed to have heard something from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I managed to gather sub- <br>stantial information from the Ansar. If on my visit to <br>someone of the Sahabah, Ifound him asleep, I spread <br>my shawl at the gate and sat waiting. Sometimes my <br>face and body would get covered with dust, but I kept <br>sitting till they woke and I was able to contact them. <br>Some of them said: 'Abdullah you are the cousin of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); you could have <br>sent for us. Why did you take the trouble of coming to <br>our places?' I said to them: 'I must come to you, for I <br>am a student and you are my teachers.' Some people <br>for whom I had waited said: 'Since when have you <br>been waiting for us?' I informed them that I had been <br>sitting there for a pretty long time. They said: 'What a <br>pity! You could have awakened us from our sleep.' I <br>said:\"I did not like to disturb you for my own sake.' I <br>thus carried on my pursuits, till there came a time <br>when people began to flock to me for learning.

Two reputed Shaikhs from Khurasan <br>were holding their lectures on Hadith in the Haram separa- <br>tely, and a large number of people were listening to each <br>Shaikh. He sat between the two groups and noted down the <br>lectures of both the Shaikhs at one and the same time. <br>Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mo- <br>haddith of great fame. His labours and efforts in collecting <br>Hadiths are known to everybody. He says: <br>\"I have learnt Hadith from four thousand teachers.\" <br>Ali bin Hasan (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>':It was a very cold night when I and Ibn Mubarak step- <br>ped out from the musjid after lsha. We continued dis- <br>cussion on a Hadith while standing there, till we heard <br>the Azaan for Fajr.\"<br><br>6 <br>ramah (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith who is not very <br>famous. One of his students, Daud, says: <br>\"People speak about the memory of Abu Hatim (Rah- <br>matullah alaih). I have never seen a person with better <br>memory than Qartamah. Once he said to me, \"Pick any <br>of the books from my library. I shall recite it from my <br>memory.\" I picked up 'Kitabul-Ashribah.' He recited <br>the whole book in the reverse order i.e.. reading from <br>the end to the beginning of each chapter.\" <br>Abu Zur'ah (Rahmatullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Ahmad bin Hambal (Rahmatullah alaih) re-<br>membered one million Ahadith by heart.

Nobody raises his eyes to look at <br>him, out of respect for him.\" <br>4. \t Hadhrat Waa'il (Radhiyallaho anho) Has His Hair <br>Cut. <br>Hadhrat Waa'il bin Hajar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once visited the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when the hair on my head was long. While I was <br>sitting with him, he uttered the words. 'Zubab, Zubab' <br>(Meaning something evil or ominous). I though he was <br>referring to my hair. I returned home and had my hair <br>cut.

He did not mix with <br>people, nor did he go anywhere. He was either busy in <br>Salaat or in Zikr throughout the day. While going to <br>musjid, he would pass by Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), one of the eminent Sahabah. Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) would say to him: <br>\"0,Suhail! Let us hear some good words from you. We <br>shalI'gain much, though you will lose nothing.\" <br>Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) would then relate <br>something that he had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), or some event that he had seen in his life <br>time. Once on Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>request as usual, he said: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made a <br>mention of Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho<br>anho) and said, \"He is a good man except for two <br>h bi<br>i<br>h<br>k<br>h<br>h i<br>f hi<br>h<br>d<br>l<br>d<br><br>Ch. IX:Pleasing the Prophet <br>He then, refused to speak to him throughout his.life. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho's) son obviously <br>had no intention of disobeying the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He feared corruption in allowing the <br>women-folk of that time to go to the musjid. For the same <br>reason, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"If the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had seen <br>the women of our time, he would have stopped them <br>from going to the musjid.\" <br>Now, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said this not <br>very long after the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho hlaihe <br>wasallam). Notwithstanding all this, Hadhrat Ibn Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his son refusing to <br>do something which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had desired to be done, and he gave up talking to him <br>for the rest of his life. The Sahabah sometimes found them- <br>selves faced with a dilemma regarding the women visiting <br>the musjid. On the one hand, there was the explicit desire <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in favour of<br><br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) Replies to a <br>Question. <br>Somebody said to Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Allah has said in the Qur'arl something about Salaat <br>in peace and Salaat in fear. but He has not said any- <br>thing about Salaat during a journey.\" <br>He replied: \"0,my nephew! Allah sent Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as his Apostle to us, when we <br>were ignorant and knew nothing. We must do what we <br>have seen him doing.\" <br>This shows that it is not necessary that each and every <br>regulation should be explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. <br>The acts of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is a <br>very good guide for our practice. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been given the Qur'an and also other com- <br>mandments. Beware of the time, which is coming <br>shortly, when carefree people sitting on their couches <br>will say 'Stick to the Qur'an only Carry out only the<br><br>Ch. IX:Pleasing the Prophet <br>By Allah! I will never speak to you again. 1 will never <br>visit you when you are sick, nor join your funeral if <br>you die during my life time.\" <br>'Khazaf' is a game in which a pebble is placed on the <br>thumb and then thrown with the force of other fingers. <br>Children are fond of playing such games. Hadhrat Ibn Mug- <br>haffal [Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his nephew's <br>ignoring the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Do we not know the instructions of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) about many things we are wont to <br>do from morning till evening? How much regard do we <br>have in our hearts for his verdict? Let everybody ponder <br>over it himself and answer. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) Gives up <br>Begging. . <br>Hadhrat Hakim bin Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and begged him <br>for help. He gave him something. Next time he came and <br>asked for something. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>l<br>)<br>hi<br>hi<br>hi<br>i<br>l<br>h<br>h<br><br>army of the enemy, comprising of non-believers from <br>Mecca and other such groups. At the same time, the <br>Jews of Banu Quraizah in Madinah were preparing to <br>stab us in the back, and we apprehended their plun- <br>dering our houses and families, for all of us were out- <br>side defending Madinah against the invaders. The <br>Munafiqin started asking permission from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to go back to Madinah, on <br>the pretext of their homes being unattended and open <br>to the enemy. He permitted every one of them. During <br>those days of trial, one night it was unusually very <br>dark and windy, It was so dark that one could not see <br>one's own hand, and the wind was blowing wildly. <br>The Munafiqin were returning to their homes. We, <br>three hundred strong, were sticking to our posts. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) approached every <br>one and made enquiries about him. I had no arms to <br>defend myself, nor clothes to resist the cold. I had only <br>one small sheet, which belonged to my wife and was <br>lent to me. I wrapped it round my loins and sat with <br>my knees clinging to the ground. When the Prophet <br>(S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>d b<br>h<br>id<br><br>Ch.

I had actually taken out an arrow from <br>my quiver and placed it in my bow, when I remem-<br>bered the directive of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I put the arrow back into the quiver. While <br>I was among them, they seemed to become aware of <br>my presence. They shouted, 'There is a spy among us. <br>Every one of us should catch the hand of the person <br>next to him I immediately caught the hand of a person <br>and shouted, 'Who are you?

They <br>said to me, 'Tell your master that Allah has dealt with <br>his enemy and that he has nothing to worry about <br>now.' Whgn I reached my camp, I found the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying his Salaat with a <br>small shawl around him. Whenever he faced a diffi- <br>~ ~ l l t y .<br>he immediately turned towards Salaat.

In spite of this <br>abundance, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) led a life <br>of abstention. Look! She distributes 100 000 dirhams to the <br>poor, but she does not remember to get some meat for her <br>own Iftar. In our own atmosphere today, such stories seem <br>to be impossible but, to the people who have understood <br>the Sahabah's frame of mind, hundreds of such incidents <br>are quite credible. There are many stories of this nature re- <br>ported about Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha). Once she was <br>fasting and had nothing for her Iftar except one piece of <br>bread. A poor man came and begged for some food. She <br>asked her maid to give him that piece of bread. The maid <br>said: <br>\"If I give him the piece of bread, there will be nothing <br>left for your Iftar\". <br>She said: \"Never mind. Let him have the piece\".<br><br>5 s<br>Ch.

He mentioned this to somebody -8q <br>and said: <br>m<br>3 m  <br>\"I must stop my aunt from doing that\". <br>She learnt about this and was so much displeased that <br>she swore not to speak to Hadhrat Abdullah for the rest of <br>her life. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was very much shocked by her oath. He deputed many <br>people to speak to her for him, but she told them, \"I have <br>taken an oath and I am not prepared to violate it.\" He, at <br>last, took two persons from the family of the Prophet's <br>mother to her house to intercede for him. Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) allowed the persons to enter the house and <br>to speak to her from behind a curtain. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) also stealthily got in with these persons. <br>When these persons started talking, he could not control <br>himself and crossed the curtain and clung to his aunt, <br>crying and entreating her for pardon. The two persons also <br>interceded and reminded her of the Prophet's forbidding a <br>Muslim from forswearing speech with another Muslim. <br>When she heard this Hadith, she got frightened of Allah's <br>displeasure and the result thereof and began to weep very<br><br>12<br>1 <br>field. Jibrail used to greet her with 'Assalamo alaikum'. The <br>Prophet once told her that she would be his wife in the Par- <br>adise. When she was slandered by the Munafiqin, Allah <br>exonerated her from the slander and confirmed her inno- <br>cence by revealing verses in the Qur'an. <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once enumerated as <br>many as ten special virtues that Allah had given her over <br>the other wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Her spending in the path of Allah has already been nar- <br>rated in the previous stories. In spite of all these privileges <br>and virtues, she feared Allah so much that she was often <br>heard saying; <br>\"I wish I was a tree, so that I could be always busy in <br>Allah's tasbih and be absolved of reckoning on the Day <br>of Judgment\". <br>\"I wish I had been a stone or a clod of earth\". <br>\"I wish I had been a leaf of tree or a blade of grass\". <br>\"I wish I had not been born at all\"<br><br>have nobody except Allah to accompany me.' He took <br>the rope of my camel and began to lead. By Allah, I <br>have never come across a person more noble than <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). When I had to <br>get down, he would make the camel sit and himself go <br>behind a hush and when I had to climb up he would <br>bring the camel and make it sit close to me. He would <br>then hold the rope and lead the animal. Thus we <br>reached Quba (a suburb of Madinah). He informed me <br>that Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>staying there. He then made us over to my husband <br>and then returned all the way back toXMecca. By Allah, <br>no one else could bear the hardships that I bore during <br>that single year\". <br>Look at Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha's) <br>faith and trust.in Allah. She set out on a long and hazard- <br>ous journey all alone.

The hus- <br>band turned renegade and died there ,as a Kafir. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alhihe wasallam) sent his offer to marry <br>her through king Negus, while she was still passing her <br>days in Abyssinia as a widow. She accepted the offer and <br>came to Madinah to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). During the period of truce between the Muslims <br>and the idolaters of Mecca, her father Hadhrat Abu Sufyan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once came to Madinah for negotia- <br>tions in connection with reinforcing the truce. He went to <br>see Umme Habibah. As he was about to sit on the bedding <br>in her room, she removed it from under him. He was sur- <br>prised over her behaviour and said: <br>\"Was the bedding unfit for me or I unfit for the bed- <br>ding?\" <br>She replied:<br>\"This bedding is meant for the dear and holy<br><br>anha) his proposal for marriage. When Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) received the proposal, she said: <br>\"Let me consult my Lord!\" <br>She then performed Wudhu and stood up in her Salaat. Her <br>action was so much blessed by Allah that the following <br>verse was revealed to the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>-<br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (hence forth) there mav be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed necessary formality (of <br>release) from them.

They, how- <br>ever, came to know later that long hands symbolised lavish <br>spending in charity. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was indeed the first to die after the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). <br>Hadhrat Barazah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>Hadhrat \"Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to pay an <br>annual allowance to the Ummahat-ul-Mominin from <br>the Baitul Maal. He sent 12 000 dirhams to Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) through me as her share.<br><br>(refuge of the poor), due to her lavish spending in <br>charity.\" <br>A woman narrates: <br>1 <br>\"I and Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) were <br>dyeing our clothes with red ochre. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) came in, but went out again <br>when he saw us engaged ih dyeing. Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) felt that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had perhaps not liked our dyeing in <br>that colour. She immediately washed all the dyed <br>clothes till their colour was gone.\" <br>Everybody knows the love and liking of women for <br>money and colours. But look at these ladies, who would <br>push away the money coming to them and who were pre- <br>pared to discard any colour on receiving the least hint of <br>the Prophet's disapproval. <br>11. \t Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) Exhorts Her <br>Sons to Bravery.<br><br>to find out if there were any men with the ladies.

You go out and <br>kill him.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was a weak person. <br>He did not make bold to do the job. Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) got hold of a tent peg and went outside the fortress <br>and gave a blow on the head of the Jew that killed him on <br>the spot. She came back and said to Hassaan: <br>\"The man is dead. I have not removed the clothes and <br>arms from his body for reasons of modesty. Now you <br>go and remove everything from his body. Also bring <br>his head after severing it from the body.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was too weak-<br>hearted to do that even. She herself went again and brought <br>his head, and threw it over the wall amidst the Jews.

If I could make somebody prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah, I would ask the wives to prostrate <br>before their husbands.\" <br>The following is reported to have been said by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in this connection: <br>(1) \"A woman whose husband is pleased with her at <br>the time of her death goes straight into Paradise.\" <br>(2) \t \"A woman is cursed by the angels if her husband <br>is displeased with her, and she stays away from <br>him in anger for the night.\" <br>(3) \t \"The Salaat of two persons hardly rises beyond <br>their heads in its flight to heaven. These two per-<br><br>shout to my son, who would run to my help and then <br>we both finished the man in no time.\" <br>Her son Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I had a wound on my left arm, which would not stop <br>bleeding. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said to my mother, 'Put a bandage over it.' My mother <br>took out a bandage from her belt and after bandaging <br>f'<br>my wound, said, 'Now, son. go and fight again with <br>the idolaters.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was watching us. He said, '0, Umme Ammarah, <br>who can have courage like yours?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at that time <br>prayed again and again for Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) and her family. Hadhra: Umme Ammarah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was standing with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), when one of the enemy passed in front of me. <br>The Pro~;?et (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] said to me, <br>Umme Ammarah!

After the fall of Mecca, her husband fled to <br>Yemen. She secured pardon for him from the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and went to Yemen and induced <br>her husband to return to his home. She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts. We shall <br>meet after they are done away with.\" <br>He said: \"I am sure I shall not survive this battle \"<br><br>13 <br>patiently bore the hardships in various forms in the cause <br>i <br>of Islam. She would not weaken in her love for and devo- <br>tion to Islam in spite of all these afflictions. One day, <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was standing <br>when Abu Jahl passed that way. He flung all sorts of dirty <br>words at her and then put his spear through her private <br>parts. She died on account of the wound. She is the first to <br>meet martyrdom for the cause of Islam. <br>Patience, perseverence and sacrifice of these ladies are <br>really enviable. No affliction is too much when a person <br>blessed with the spirit of Islam is determined to bear it. We <br>hear about hundreds of persons dying for one cause or the <br>other. It is only dying for the cause of Allah that brings <br>eternal happiness and comfort in the life to come. Persons <br>losing their lives for material gains really lose twice, i.e., in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. <br>17. The story of Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). <br>Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anha) is <br>the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho),<br><br>Ch. X :  Women's Courage S. Spirit for Islam <br>take it to Ansar women in my neighbourhood, who <br>would bake bread for me. When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it. (In fact, <br>Sahabah remained occupied in striving in the path of <br>All h<br>d<br>ll<br>th<br>h j b<br>h d t<br>b<br>d<br>b<br>th i<br><br>my father used to keep his money; I covered it with a <br>cloth. I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI) The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once<br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>195 <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age She came of age and then accepted Islam She was<br><br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>i<br><br>sounding epithets being used for the open enemies of <br>Islam. When they are reminded, they call it narrow-mind- <br>f<br>edness. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>i <br>\"Don't call a Munafiq a chief. You displease Allah <br>when you take him as a chief.\" <br>22. Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>thi<br>i<br>ld<br>t t k<br>l<br>H<br>fi t h<br>b<br>d<br><br>thes Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's death. She died <br>on the night of Tuesday, the 17th Ramadhan, 57 A. H., at <br>the age of sixty-six. She desired at the time of her death <br>that she might be buried, along with other Ummahat-ul- <br>Momineen, in the public graveyard, though she could be <br>buried by the side of the Prophet's grave, which was in her <br>house. She was the only wife of the Prophet who had not <br>been married previously. All the remaining wives had <br>either been widowed or divorced (some quite a few times) <br>before they became Ummuhat-ul-Momineen. To be married <br>in Shawwal was considered a bad omen among the Arab <br>women. Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was married in Shawwal. It was also Shawwal when <br>I was sent to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasailam). Which of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam's) wives has been more blessed with his love <br>! <br>and Allah's other favours than me?\" <br>Oh the death of Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), <br>Hadhrat Khaulah bint Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said:<br><br>laho anho) who was born in Mecca five years before the <br>Nubuwwat. She was first married to Hadhrat Khunais bin <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho), who was one of the very <br>early Muslims. He first emigrated to Abyssinia and then to <br>Madinah. He participated in Badr, and was fatally <br>wounded in Badr (or in Uhud) and died of the wound in <br>the year 1 or 2 A. H. Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had also emigrated to Madinah with her husband. When <br>her husband died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went <br>to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and said: <br>\"I want to give Hafsah in marriage to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) kept quiet and said <br>nothing. Meanwhile Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) the <br>daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and <br>the wife of 'Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) died. <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat <br>Usman (Radhiyailaho anho) and offered Hadhrat Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho's) hand to him. He declined by saying. <br>\"I have no mind to marry for the present.\" 'Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) complained of this to the Prophet. The <br>Prophet said:<br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>203 <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), for some reason, <br>was displeased with Hafsah and even pronounced the first <br>divorce to her. 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was na- <br>turally very much shocked over this. Jibra-eel Alayhis came <br>to the Prophet (Sallal Salaam laho alaihe wasallam) and <br>said: <br>\"Allah wants you to take Hafsah back, as she is fasting <br>often and spending her nights in Salaat, and also Allah <br>wants it for Hadhrat Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>sake.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) therefore <br>took her back. She died in Jamadil oola, 45 A. H., at the age <br>of 63. <br>(5) Hadhrat Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was the next to be <br>married to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). There <br>are divergent reports about her previous husbands. Accord- <br>ing to one report, she was first married to Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) who was killed in Uhud, <br>as we have already seen in his story in chapter VI1 Accord<br><br>secutions of Qureysh. A son was born to them in exile, who <br>was named Salamah. After returning from Abyssinia, the <br>family emigrated to Madinah. Hadhrat Umme Salamah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) story about her journey to Madinah <br>has been already given in the early part of the chapter. <br>After reaching Madinah, Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) got another son 'Umar and two daughters, <br>Durrah and Zainab (Radhiyallaho anhum). Hadhrat Abu <br>Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) was the eleventh man to em- <br>brace Islam. He participated in the battle of Badr as well as <br>in Uhud. He got a severe wound in Uhud, which did not <br>heal for a long time. He was sent by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in an expedition in Safar, 4 A. H. When <br>he returned from the expedition, the old wound again <br>started giving trouble and at last he died of the same on 8th <br>Jamadil-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was pregnant at the time. Zainab was born to <br>her after the death of her husband. After she had completed <br>her Iddat (waiting period), Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) proposed to marry her, but she declined. <br>Later, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) offered <br>t<br>h<br>Sh<br>id<br>L :\" <br>k \" \t<br>1 <br>i <br>i <br>1<br><br>k5<br>a, oec<br>Ch.

Once I contrived to see her. I found her <br>much more beautiful than I had heard. I mentioned <br>this to Hafsah who said. \"In my opinion, she is not as <br>beautiful as people say.\" <br>She was the last of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam's) wives to die. It was in 59 or 62 A. H. She was 84 at <br>the time of her death, and as, such she was born 9 years <br>before Nubuwwat. <br>As has already been said, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) married her after the death of Hadhrat <br>Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha). She therefore <br>lived in Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha's) house. She <br>found a hand mill a kettle and some barley in an earthen<br><br>Allah.\" She performed Wudhu, said two rakaat of Salaat, <br>and prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy Prophet proposes to marry me. If I am <br>fit for the honour, then give me in his marriage.\" <br>Allah answered her prayer by revealing the following verse <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed the necessary formality <br>(of release) from them. The Commandment of Allah <br>must be fulfilled.\" <br>(XXXIII:37) <br>When she received the good news about this revel- <br>ation<br>she prostrated before Allah in thanksgiving<br>The<br>114<br>/ <br>!<br><br>"

After her death, he married <br>her niece Amamah (Radhiyallaho anha), as we have <br>already seen in the previous pages. <br>1 <br>It was about six months after the death of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that Fatimah fell ill. One day, <br>she said to her maid: <br>\"I want to takep bath. Arrange some water for me.\" <br>She took a bath and changed her clothes. She then desired <br>her bed to be placed in the middle of the room. She laid <br>herself down on the bedding, with her face towards Qiblah, <br>and her right hand under her right cheek, and said: <br>\"I am now going to die.\" <br>The next moment she was no more. The Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) progeny continued and shall con- <br>tinue (inshallah) through her children. She had three sons <br>and three daughters. Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hus- <br>sain (Radhiyallaho anho) were born in the second and the <br>third year after the marriage, respectively. Muhassan (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the third son, was born in 4 A. H.,.but <br>died in childhood.<br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>175<br>He said: \"I want you to take a husband after my death\" <br>He then prayed, saying, \"0,Allah! Let Umme Salmah <br>be married after my death to a husband better than I. May <br>he give her no trouble whatsoever\". <br>In the beginning, the couple emigrate'd to Abyssinia. <br>After their return, they again emigrated to Madinah Hadh- <br>rat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"When my husband made up his mind to emigrate to <br>Madinah, he loaded the camel with the luggage. He <br>then made me and our son Salmah ride the camel. He <br>led the camel out of the town, holding the string in his <br>hand. The people of my father's clan (Banu Mughirah) <br>happened to see us leaving. They came and snatched <br>the,string from Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho's) hqnd saying, 'You can go wherever you like <br>but we cannot allow our girl to go and perish with <br>you.' They forcibly took me and my son back to their <br>clan. When the people of my husband's clan (Banu <br>Abdul Asad) learnt this, they came to Banu Mughirah <br>and began to argue with them saying, \"You can keep<br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>3 I11<br>and observed to the Sahabah: \t<br>'C C, <br>\"Khubaib has been martyred by the Qureysh.\" <br>m <br>S m  <br>At the gallows, forty of the Querysh speared him simul- <br>taneously. One of those teased him: <br>Say by Allah, if you now wish Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) to be in your place and you to be let <br>off.\" <br>He replied: \t \"By Allah the Most Magnificent. I will not tol- <br>erate a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in ransom for my life.\" <br>Every word of this story is a lesson for us all. The de- <br>votion and love of the Sahabah narrated therein is really <br>something to esteem and covet. They would lay down their <br>very lives, but they would not tolerate even a thorn piick- <br>ing the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Again, look at <br>Hadhrat Khubaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) last wish. He <br>neither remembers his family members nor wishes to see <br>any of them; what he wishes is to send his last Salaam to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and to say two last <br>rakaats of Salaat<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>4<br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad-<br><br>10<br>my life. You know that I have always <br>loved Thee. Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me I<br><br>11<br>in the wording, recited each Hadith before Imam Bukhari <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). On each recital, he would say: <br>\"1 do not know such Hadith.\" <br>When all had finished, he addressed each man saying: <br>\"Brother, the first Hadith you recited as such (reciting <br>as the man had done), but actually it is such (reciting <br>the correct wording) . . .and so on.\" <br>He repeated all the hundred Ahadith first in the form in <br>which those men had recited, and again in the correct form <br>in that very order. <br>Imam Muslim (Rahmatullah alaih) started learning <br>Hadith when he was fourteen, and remained engaged in <br>that till his death. He says: <br>\"I have compiled my book of <br>from 300 000 Ahadith.\" <br>12 000 after selecting <br>Abu Daud (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I had collected 500 000 Ahadith, but I selected only <br>4 800 f<br>i<br>l<br>i<br>i<br>b<br>k \"<br><br>12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Ch<br>t<br>VIII Z<br>l f<br>k<br>l d<br><br>2 <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town<br><br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh accepting their conditions in full<br><br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>h )<br>d hi<br>h i<br>b<br>k<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah<br><br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>h<br>h<br>h<br>f b<br>i<br>h<br>P<br>h '<br>i<br>H<br><br>Ch.

His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing<br><br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0 P<br>h t<br>f All h! B Hi<br>h<br>i th<br>t<br>f<br><br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho).

He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was<br><br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore \" 'But I am taking them by<br><br>Ch.

'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said:<br><br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse:<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new,<br><br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>33 <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\"<br><br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>h<br>Q<br>h<br>h<br>f<br>d<br>id d<br>l<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>35 <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said,<br><br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>39 <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>3 <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah:<br><br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and<br><br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam:<br><br>Ch.

The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), on the death of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>f<br>f H dh<br>t Ai h h (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h ) b t I<br><br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>45 <br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>4<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>i<br>l<br>f h<br>'<br>b<br>h<br>ld<br><br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying:<br><br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>d<br>l<br>f<br>h<br>Ch i i<br>Ki<br>f<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days.

This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>53 <br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me you will see how I<br><br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse:<br><br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse:<br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear<br><br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that when he wept he smeared his tears over<br><br>ABSTENENCE AND SELF-DENIAL OF THE SAHABAH <br>Page No. <br>The Prophet's dislike for gold ................... <br>60 <br>The Prophet's life of abstinence ................. <br>60 <br>Abu Hurairah in state of hunger ................. <br>62 <br>Abu Bakr's daily allowance frbm Baitul-ma1 ...... <br>63 <br>Umar's daily allowance from Baitul-ma1 ......... <br>65 <br>Bilal's story about the Prophet .................. <br>67 <br>Another story of Abu Hurairah's hunger .......... <br>69 <br>The Prophet's opinion about two persons ........ <br>70 <br>Privations go with love forthe Prophet ........... <br>71 <br>The Al-Ambar Expedition ...................... <br>72<br><br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter?

She said: <br>5<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>5 <br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>d<br>i<br>h<br>i h<br>hi<br>if<br>d hi<br>ki<br>i h<br><br>5 <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"Wh<br>Ab<br>B k (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>l<br>d<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali.

One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah!

'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when<br><br>Their number varied with time. But at this particular <br>juncture, they mustered seventy in all. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>d<br>d<br>h<br>ill<br>ll<br>f<br>h<br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>l<br>f<br>f<br>th<br>th f All h It i<br>id i H dith<br><br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con-<br><br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>1 <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'The flesh nourished by haraam food, is des- <br>ti<br>d f<br>th<br>fi<br>f H ll ' I th<br>f<br>d<br>h<br>t<br>t<br><br>w <br>Ch.

They could <br>.c2~<br>not dare taking anything that was 'haraam', which is so <br>usual these days. <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Bait-ul-Maal: <br>Ibn-Seereen writes: <br>\"When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he said to his daughter, Hadhrat Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), 'I did not like to take anything <br>from the Bait-ul-Maal, but Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) insisted on it, to relieve me of my occupation, <br>and to enable me to devote nly full time to the duties <br>of the 'Khilafat: and I was left no choice. Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallahoanho) remarked:<br><br>6<br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder<br><br>6 \t<br>Ch. IV:Piety and Scrupulousness <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else ' This brother is his<br><br>6 <br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>8 <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) She<br><br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\"<br><br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to<br><br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"Ma<br>Allah ha e merc<br>on o ! The child's life<br>as in<br><br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once<br><br>Ch.

He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning.

They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations Allah<br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise.

They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then.

A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing<br><br>7 <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too).<br><br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight When we sit at the meal<br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>99 <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she camel in stead; which he refused to accept<br><br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) trying to emulate <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>for contributions in the path of Allah. In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam):<br><br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it she simply exclaimed<br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>103 <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of<br><br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\"<br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with<br><br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse,<br><br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I:<br>'I did not forget you instructions but thought it better<br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br><br>8<br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity<br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>111<br>8 <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money<br><br>8 <br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual.<br><br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2<br>HadhratAli's (Radhiyallahoanho)valour in Uhud:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both \"<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>er m ch to join the battle People said to him:<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud,<br><br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam In the battle of<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind<br><br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\"<br><br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>123 <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhi allaho<br><br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time I<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>l h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>ll<br>h<br>h<br><br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred We have never<br><br>9 <br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>0 <br>I<br>0<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings,<br><br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem-<br><br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts<br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path.<br><br>IJbayy bin Kaab, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Hadhrat <br>Ma'aaz bin Jabal, Hadhrat Ammaar bin Yaasir, Hadhrat Hu- <br>zaifah, Hadhrat Salman Farsi, Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit, <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum). <br>To give Fatwa during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) was a big privilege for these Saha- <br>bah, and speaks of their deep and dependable knowledge. <br>2. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) burns his col- <br>lections: <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"My father (Hadhrat Abu Bakr) (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had a collection of five hundred Hadiths. One night I <br>noticed that he was very restless. He was tossing about <br>in the bed and could not sleep. I got worried over this <br>and inquired, 'Are you suffering from any trouble or <br>worried about anything.' But he did not speak and re- <br>mained restless throughout the night. Next morning he <br>called me and said 'Bring the collection of Hadith that<br><br>\"These teachings are very fine and these verses are <br>simply beautiful. How do you admit a person to your <br>faith?\" <br>He said: \t \"You take a bath, put on clean clothes and recite <br>the Kalimah.\" <br>Usaid immediately complied with all these formalities and <br>embraced Islam. He then went to Sa'd and brought him to <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) to listen to his Tabligh. Sa'd <br>also embraced Islam. No sooner had Sa'd accepted Islam <br>than he went to people of his clan (Banu Ash-hal) and said <br>to them: <br>\"What type of person do you think I am?\" <br>They replied: \"You are the best and the noblest of <br>clan.\" <br>the <br>He then said: \"I have vowed not to talk to your men and <br>women until you all embrace Islam and be- <br>lieve in Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe was- <br>sallam).\" <br>All th<br>d<br>f B<br>A h h 1<br>b<br>d I l<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>He used \t to finish the Qur'an once in Tahajjud in eight <br>nights. Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassalam) said <br>to him: <br>\"Allah has commanded me to recite the Qur'an to <br>you.\" <br>He said: \t \"0, Prophet of Allah! Did Allah mention me by <br>my name?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Yes, He mentioned you by your name.\" <br>Tears began to roll down his cheeks with excessive joy. <br>Hadhrat Jundub bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When I went to Madinah to acquire knowledge, I <br>found that people were sitting in groups, and each <br>group wag entrusted to a teacher. In one of the groups I <br>saw a person teaching Hadith, clad in two sheets of <br>cloth and looking like a traveller. I asked the people, <br>'Who is this person?' They said, 'He is our esteemed <br>Imam, Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho).'<br><br>F <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He remarked, 'I also thought that it <br>was he.\" <br>In spite of his devotion to knowledge and his special <br>job of writing the Qur'an, he took part in all the battles by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He did <br>not miss a single campaign or expedition led by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Huzaifah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Anxiety Re- <br>garding Tribulations. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the <br>well-known Sahabah. He is known as 'Keeper of Secrets.' <br>The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) had confided to <br>him the names of Munafiqin, and had informed him in <br>1<br>chronological order all the tribulations which the Muslims <br>were to face till the last day. He gave him full details (viz. <br>the name of the mischief maker, his parents' names, his <br>community, etc.) about the incidents that were going to <br>affect three hundred or more people. Hadhrat Huzaifah <br>(Radhiyallahoanho)says:<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>TheProphet: \t \"Yes, good will come again, but the hearts <br>of the people will not be so clear as before.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"And will there by any evil coming after <br>this good?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes, There will be such persons who will <br>misguide the people and take them to Hell.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"What should I do if I witness that time?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"If there be a group of Muslims united <br>under one Amir, then join them, otherwise <br>dissociate yourself from all such factions <br>and be secluded in a corner, or take refuge <br>under a tree (i.e., in the forest) and be there <br>till you die.\" <br>As the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had dis- <br>closed to him the identities of the Munafiqin of that time, <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to ask him: <br>\"Is there any Munafiq among my deputies?\" <br>Heonce replied:<br>\"Yes. There is one, but I shall not dis-<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>0 <br>\"A person participating in a funeral gets one Qeeraat of <br>reward if he returns after the funeral service, but gets <br>two Qeeraats of reward if he remains there till the <br>burial is over, and one Qeeraat is weightier than mount <br>Uhud.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) heard <br>this and doubted authenticity of the Hadith, saying: <br>\"0.Abu Hurairah! Think before you speak.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) got upset over <br>this and took Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to Hadhrat 'Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), and said to <br>her: <br>\"0,Ummul-Mo'minin, I request you to say by Allah if <br>you have beard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) the Hadith regarding Qeeraats of reward?\" <br>She said: \"Yes. I have heard this Hadith.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) then said to <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho):<br><br>10 \t<br>laho alaihe wasallam). After the death of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), people of the weak faith, <br>especially among wandering Arabs, began to desert Islam <br>and become renegades. Musailamah took advantage of the <br>situation and succeeded in causing a large number of <br>people to fall a prey to his seduction. Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) decided to put a stop to this onslaught on Islam. <br>A fierce battle was fought with him, in which the Muslims <br>triumphed with the help of Allah, and Musailamah was <br>killed. A good number of Sahabah, including many Huffaz, <br>however, lost their lives. After this battle, Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and said: <br>\"Many Huffaz gave been slain in this battle. I am afraid <br>we are likely to lose a good portion of the Qur'an if we <br>fight a few more battles and suffer loss of Hufaaz at <br>this rate. I, therefore, suggest that the Qur'an may be <br>compiled and preserved in the form of one complete <br>book.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho)remarked:<br><br>only person whom I can safely appoint as an Amir <br>without consulting anybody.\" <br>He was permitted by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to visit him at all times. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>(1) \"If you want to recite the Qur'an as it was revealed <br>to me, then copy the recitation of Abdullah bin <br>Mas'ood.\" <br>(2) \t \"Believe in what Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>iaho anho) narrates about me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Moosa Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>mother visited the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) house so often and were so at home there that the <br>people of Yemen, who had come to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), took him as one of the <br>Ahlul Bait (family member.)\" Though he was so near <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), yet he was <br>ti<br>b<br>t<br>ti<br>th<br>d<br>f th P<br>h t<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"A person who attributes anything to me, which I have <br>not said, is making his abode in the Hell.\" <br>This is why the Sahabah, though speaking and doing every- <br>thing according to the instructions and example of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), were afraid of attribu- <br>ting any words to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>lest they should be different from what the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) had actually uttered. On the other <br>hand, we go on quoting Ahadith without being sure of their <br>authenticity and fear not the serious consequences of at- <br>tributing wrongly anything to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). It may be mentioned that the Fiqah.Hani- <br>fiyah is based mostly on the Ahadith narrated by Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>A Person Travels from Madinah to Damascus For One <br>Hadith. <br>Kathir bin Qais narrates: <br>\"I was sitting with Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho<br><br>one who traverses some distance to seek knowledge. <br>The angels spread their wings under his feet, and all <br>things in heavens and earth (even the fish in the water) <br>pray for his forgiveness. The superiority of a person <br>possessing knowledge over a person doing worship is <br>as the superiority of the moon over the stars. The <br>Ulama are the inheritors of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wassallam). The legacy of Prophets (Alaihimus- <br>salaam) is neither gold nor silver. Their legacy is <br>knowledge. A person who acquires knowledge ac-<br>quires a great wealth.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu-Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) is foremost <br>among the Sahabah who possessed very sound knowledge <br>in religion. He is called 'Hakim-ul-Ummah' (The Sage of <br>Islam). He once said: <br>\"Before Islam, I lived on trade. After accepting Islam, I <br>tried to combine the service of Allah with my business, <br>but I could not do so. I therefore gave up business and <br>devoted myself solely to the service of Allah. Now if I <br>have a shop at the gate of a musjid and have no fear of <br>l<br>i<br>i<br>l<br>S l<br>h<br>b<br>d<br>if<br>h<br>h<br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"For each Hadith that I have learnt, I had to travel on <br>foot for days and nights together.\" <br>Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullahi alaih) was born in Shawwal <br>194 A.H. He started learning Hadith in 205 A.H. i.e., when <br>he was only eleven. He had memorised all the books writ- <br>ten by Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullahi alaih) while <br>he was in his early teens. After collecting Ahadith from all <br>the learned men of his own locality, he set out in 216 A.H. <br>in search of further knowledge. His father died and he <br>could not leave his widowed mother alone. He therefore <br>took her with him on his long and strenuous journey to <br>Balkh, Baghdad, Mecca, Basra, Koofah, Asqalan, Hims and <br>Damascus. He collected all the available Ahadith from <br>these seats of learning. He was accepted as an expert in <br>Hadith, while he had not a single hair on his chin. He <br>writes: <br>I was eighteen when I compiled the Fatwah of the Sa- <br>habah and Tabi'ees.\" <br>Hashad (Rahmatullahi alaihe) and one of his companions <br>say:-<br><br>supposed to have heard something from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I managed to gather sub- <br>stantial information from the Ansar. If on my visit to <br>someone of the Sahabah, Ifound him asleep, I spread <br>my shawl at the gate and sat waiting. Sometimes my <br>face and body would get covered with dust, but I kept <br>sitting till they woke and I was able to contact them. <br>Some of them said: 'Abdullah you are the cousin of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); you could have <br>sent for us. Why did you take the trouble of coming to <br>our places?' I said to them: 'I must come to you, for I <br>am a student and you are my teachers.' Some people <br>for whom I had waited said: 'Since when have you <br>been waiting for us?' I informed them that I had been <br>sitting there for a pretty long time. They said: 'What a <br>pity! You could have awakened us from our sleep.' I <br>said:\"I did not like to disturb you for my own sake.' I <br>thus carried on my pursuits, till there came a time <br>when people began to flock to me for learning. My <br>Ansari friend realised this at that time and remarked. <br>'This boy has surely proved himself more sensible than <br>\"<br><br>~ h .  \t<br>151<br>VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"Be most humble and respectful to persons from <br>whom you receive knowledge.\" <br>Mujahid says: \"A proud or shy student cannot gain much.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I am a slave to the person who has taught me even a <br>single word. He may sell me or set me free.\" <br>Hadhrat Yahya bin Kathir (Rahmalullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Knowledge and easy living cannot go hand in hand.\" <br>Hadhrat Imam Shaf'i (Rahmatullah aiaih) says: <br>\"A student who learns half-heartedly and ungratefully <br>can never succeed. A student who is humble and hard- <br>living often reaches his goal.\" <br>Mughirah says: \t \"We feared our teachor Hadhrat Ibrahim <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) more than even the <br>kings of our times.\" <br>Hadhrat Bukhari (Rahmatullah alaih) writes about Yahya<br><br>tullahi alaihim) that they held discussions over religious <br>matters among themselves after Isha and would not dis- <br>perse before Azaan of Fajr. Hadhrat Laith bin Sa'eed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Zilhri (Rahmatullah alaih) sat after Isha with <br>Wudhu and continued his discussion on Hadith till it <br>was Fajr.\" <br>Darawardi says: <br>\"I saw Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik in the <br>Prophet's musjid after Isha, discussing some religious <br>point very calmly and without offending each other. <br>They dispersed only after performing Fajr Salaat.\" <br>Ibn Furat Baghdadi (Rahmatullah a1aih)-a <br>Milhaddith, <br>left on his death, eighteen boxes full of books. Most of <br>these books were written in his own hand. He is famous <br>among Muhaddithin for his authentic and systematic <br>record. <br>Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullah alaih) is another famous Mu- <br>haddith. He was brought up as an orphan, as he lost his<br><br>He then repeated all the eighteen Ahadiths that the Shaikh <br>had recited in the same order, quoting the chain of narra- <br>tion in each case. <br>Hafiz Athram (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith. He <br>had a wonderful capacity for memorising Ahadith. Once he <br>was in Mecca for Hajj. Two reputed Shaikhs from Khurasan <br>were holding their lectures on Hadith in the Haram separa- <br>tely, and a large number of people were listening to each <br>Shaikh. He sat between the two groups and noted down the <br>lectures of both the Shaikhs at one and the same time. <br>Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mo- <br>haddith of great fame. His labours and efforts in collecting <br>Hadiths are known to everybody. He says: <br>\"I have learnt Hadith from four thousand teachers.\" <br>Ali bin Hasan (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>':It was a very cold night when I and Ibn Mubarak step- <br>ped out from the musjid after lsha. We continued dis- <br>cussion on a Hadith while standing there, till we heard <br>the Azaan for Fajr.\"<br><br>6 <br>ramah (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith who is not very <br>famous. One of his students, Daud, says: <br>\"People speak about the memory of Abu Hatim (Rah- <br>matullah alaih). I have never seen a person with better <br>memory than Qartamah. Once he said to me, \"Pick any <br>of the books from my library. I shall recite it from my <br>memory.\" I picked up 'Kitabul-Ashribah.' He recited <br>the whole book in the reverse order i.e.. reading from <br>the end to the beginning of each chapter.\" <br>Abu Zur'ah (Rahmatullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Ahmad bin Hambal (Rahmatullah alaih) re-<br>membered one million Ahadith by heart. I have col- <br>lected 100 000 Ahadith and I know 30 000 of them by <br>heart.\" <br>Khafaf (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"Ishaq (Rahmatulla alaih) once dictated to us 11000 <br>Ahadith from his memory. He then repeated all of <br>them in the same order, with no error at all.\" <br>Ab<br>S 'd I b h<br>i (R h<br>t ll h<br>l ih)<br>h<br>h<br><br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned from his <br>journey, he asked her: <br>\"Why did you do this?\" <br>She replied: \"0,Prophet of Allah. This is only to have <br>better privacy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The worst use of money is to spend it in raising up <br>buildings.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"I and my mother were once repairing a wall of our <br>house. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) hap- <br>pened to see us working and remarked: 'Your own fall <br>(death) is more at hand than the fall of this wall.\" <br>3. \t<br>Sahabah's Discard of Red Sheets of Saddle Cloth. <br>Hadhrat Rafe' (Radhiyallaho anho) says:<br><br>Ch.

When he makes Wu ihu, <br>his companions race one with another to snatch the <br>water trickling down from his limbs, in such a way <br>that an observer would think they are going to fight <br>over that water. When he speaks, everybody is silent as <br>if they were dumb. Nobody raises his eyes to look at <br>him, out of respect for him.\" <br>4. \t Hadhrat Waa'il (Radhiyallaho anho) Has His Hair <br>Cut. <br>Hadhrat Waa'il bin Hajar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once visited the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when the hair on my head was long. While I was <br>sitting with him, he uttered the words. 'Zubab, Zubab' <br>(Meaning something evil or ominous). I though he was <br>referring to my hair. I returned home and had my hair <br>cut. Next day when I again went to him, he said, 'I <br>never referred to your hair when I uttered those words <br>d<br>A<br>h<br>i i<br>d h<br>h d<br>h i<br><br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up <br>what is not liked bythe Prophet: <br>Hadhrat Suhdil bin Hanzalah CRadhiyallaho anho) was <br>living a life of seclusion in Damascus. He did not mix with <br>people, nor did he go anywhere. He was either busy in <br>Salaat or in Zikr throughout the day. While going to <br>musjid, he would pass by Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), one of the eminent Sahabah. Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) would say to him: <br>\"0,Suhail! Let us hear some good words from you. We <br>shalI'gain much, though you will lose nothing.\" <br>Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) would then relate <br>something that he had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), or some event that he had seen in his life <br>time. Once on Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>request as usual, he said: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made a <br>mention of Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho<br>anho) and said, \"He is a good man except for two <br>h bi<br>i<br>h<br>k<br>h<br>h i<br>f hi<br>h<br>d<br>l<br>d<br><br>Ch. IX:Pleasing the Prophet <br>He then, refused to speak to him throughout his.life. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho's) son obviously <br>had no intention of disobeying the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He feared corruption in allowing the <br>women-folk of that time to go to the musjid. For the same <br>reason, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"If the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had seen <br>the women of our time, he would have stopped them <br>from going to the musjid.\" <br>Now, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said this not <br>very long after the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho hlaihe <br>wasallam). Notwithstanding all this, Hadhrat Ibn Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his son refusing to <br>do something which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had desired to be done, and he gave up talking to him <br>for the rest of his life. The Sahabah sometimes found them- <br>selves faced with a dilemma regarding the women visiting <br>the musjid. On the one hand, there was the explicit desire <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in favour of<br><br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) Replies to a <br>Question. <br>Somebody said to Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Allah has said in the Qur'arl something about Salaat <br>in peace and Salaat in fear. but He has not said any- <br>thing about Salaat during a journey.\" <br>He replied: \"0,my nephew! Allah sent Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as his Apostle to us, when we <br>were ignorant and knew nothing. We must do what we <br>have seen him doing.\" <br>This shows that it is not necessary that each and every <br>regulation should be explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. <br>The acts of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is a <br>very good guide for our practice. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been given the Qur'an and also other com- <br>mandments. Beware of the time, which is coming <br>shortly, when carefree people sitting on their couches <br>will say 'Stick to the Qur'an only Carry out only the<br><br>Ch. IX:Pleasing the Prophet <br>By Allah! I will never speak to you again. 1 will never <br>visit you when you are sick, nor join your funeral if <br>you die during my life time.\" <br>'Khazaf' is a game in which a pebble is placed on the <br>thumb and then thrown with the force of other fingers. <br>Children are fond of playing such games. Hadhrat Ibn Mug- <br>haffal [Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his nephew's <br>ignoring the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Do we not know the instructions of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) about many things we are wont to <br>do from morning till evening? How much regard do we <br>have in our hearts for his verdict? Let everybody ponder <br>over it himself and answer. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) Gives up <br>Begging. . <br>Hadhrat Hakim bin Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and begged him <br>for help. He gave him something. Next time he came and <br>asked for something. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>l<br>)<br>hi<br>hi<br>hi<br>i<br>l<br>h<br>h<br><br>army of the enemy, comprising of non-believers from <br>Mecca and other such groups. At the same time, the <br>Jews of Banu Quraizah in Madinah were preparing to <br>stab us in the back, and we apprehended their plun- <br>dering our houses and families, for all of us were out- <br>side defending Madinah against the invaders. The <br>Munafiqin started asking permission from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to go back to Madinah, on <br>the pretext of their homes being unattended and open <br>to the enemy. He permitted every one of them. During <br>those days of trial, one night it was unusually very <br>dark and windy, It was so dark that one could not see <br>one's own hand, and the wind was blowing wildly. <br>The Munafiqin were returning to their homes. We, <br>three hundred strong, were sticking to our posts. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) approached every <br>one and made enquiries about him. I had no arms to <br>defend myself, nor clothes to resist the cold. I had only <br>one small sheet, which belonged to my wife and was <br>lent to me. I wrapped it round my loins and sat with <br>my knees clinging to the ground. When the Prophet <br>(S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>d b<br>h<br>id<br><br>Ch.

I thought of fin- 33 <br>m<br>ishing him off. I had actually taken out an arrow from <br>my quiver and placed it in my bow, when I remem-<br>bered the directive of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I put the arrow back into the quiver. While <br>I was among them, they seemed to become aware of <br>my presence. They shouted, 'There is a spy among us. <br>Every one of us should catch the hand of the person <br>next to him I immediately caught the hand of a person <br>and shouted, 'Who are you? 'He said, 'Subhanallah! <br>you do not know me. I am so and so. 'I then returned <br>to my camp. While I was on my way back, I met <br>twenty horsemen with turbans on their heads. They <br>said to me, 'Tell your master that Allah has dealt with <br>his enemy and that he has nothing to worry about <br>now.' Whgn I reached my camp, I found the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying his Salaat with a <br>small shawl around him. Whenever he faced a diffi- <br>~ ~ l l t y .<br>he immediately turned towards Salaat. When he <br>had finished, I reported to him what I had seen in the<br><br>Gifts of this nature were often received by Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) from Amir Muawiah, Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma) and others. <br>for that was the time of ease and plenty for the Muslims as <br>territory after territory fell into their hands. In spite of this <br>abundance, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) led a life <br>of abstention. Look! She distributes 100 000 dirhams to the <br>poor, but she does not remember to get some meat for her <br>own Iftar. In our own atmosphere today, such stories seem <br>to be impossible but, to the people who have understood <br>the Sahabah's frame of mind, hundreds of such incidents <br>are quite credible. There are many stories of this nature re- <br>ported about Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha). Once she was <br>fasting and had nothing for her Iftar except one piece of <br>bread. A poor man came and begged for some food. She <br>asked her maid to give him that piece of bread. The maid <br>said: <br>\"If I give him the piece of bread, there will be nothing <br>left for your Iftar\". <br>She said: \"Never mind. Let him have the piece\".<br><br>5 s<br>Ch.

Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was very much shocked by her oath. He deputed many <br>people to speak to her for him, but she told them, \"I have <br>taken an oath and I am not prepared to violate it.\" He, at <br>last, took two persons from the family of the Prophet's <br>mother to her house to intercede for him. Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) allowed the persons to enter the house and <br>to speak to her from behind a curtain. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) also stealthily got in with these persons. <br>When these persons started talking, he could not control <br>himself and crossed the curtain and clung to his aunt, <br>crying and entreating her for pardon. The two persons also <br>interceded and reminded her of the Prophet's forbidding a <br>Muslim from forswearing speech with another Muslim. <br>When she heard this Hadith, she got frightened of Allah's <br>displeasure and the result thereof and began to weep very<br><br>12<br>1 <br>field. Jibrail used to greet her with 'Assalamo alaikum'. The <br>Prophet once told her that she would be his wife in the Par- <br>adise. When she was slandered by the Munafiqin, Allah <br>exonerated her from the slander and confirmed her inno- <br>cence by revealing verses in the Qur'an. <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once enumerated as <br>many as ten special virtues that Allah had given her over <br>the other wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Her spending in the path of Allah has already been nar- <br>rated in the previous stories. In spite of all these privileges <br>and virtues, she feared Allah so much that she was often <br>heard saying; <br>\"I wish I was a tree, so that I could be always busy in <br>Allah's tasbih and be absolved of reckoning on the Day <br>of Judgment\". <br>\"I wish I had been a stone or a clod of earth\". <br>\"I wish I had been a leaf of tree or a blade of grass\". <br>\"I wish I had not been born at all\"<br><br>have nobody except Allah to accompany me.' He took <br>the rope of my camel and began to lead. By Allah, I <br>have never come across a person more noble than <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). When I had to <br>get down, he would make the camel sit and himself go <br>behind a hush and when I had to climb up he would <br>bring the camel and make it sit close to me. He would <br>then hold the rope and lead the animal. Thus we <br>reached Quba (a suburb of Madinah). He informed me <br>that Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>staying there. He then made us over to my husband <br>and then returned all the way back toXMecca. By Allah, <br>no one else could bear the hardships that I bore during <br>that single year\". <br>Look at Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha's) <br>faith and trust.in Allah. She set out on a long and hazard- <br>ous journey all alone. See how Allah sent His help to her. <br>No doubt.Allah can depute anybody to render help to those <br>who place trust in Him, for the hearts of all people are in <br>His control. <br>A<br>l<br>l d<br>i<br>t<br>itt d t<br>t<br>l<br>l<br><br>Ch.

While returning from the island she fell from her <br>mule, broke her neck and died. She was buried in Cyprus. <br>Look at the spirit of Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha).

He has <br>taken him back.\"<br><br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umrne Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Be-<br>haviour With Her Fatht~r: <br>Hadhrat Ummul Mominin Umme Habibah (Radhiyal- <br>I <br>laho anha) was previously married to Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. <br>She emigrated with her husband to Abyssinia. The hus- <br>band turned renegade and died there ,as a Kafir. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alhihe wasallam) sent his offer to marry <br>her through king Negus, while she was still passing her <br>days in Abyssinia as a widow. She accepted the offer and <br>came to Madinah to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). During the period of truce between the Muslims <br>and the idolaters of Mecca, her father Hadhrat Abu Sufyan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once came to Madinah for negotia- <br>tions in connection with reinforcing the truce. He went to <br>see Umme Habibah. As he was about to sit on the bedding <br>in her room, she removed it from under him. He was sur- <br>prised over her behaviour and said: <br>\"Was the bedding unfit for me or I unfit for the bed- <br>ding?\" <br>She replied:<br>\"This bedding is meant for the dear and holy<br><br>anha) his proposal for marriage. When Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) received the proposal, she said: <br>\"Let me consult my Lord!\" <br>She then performed Wudhu and stood up in her Salaat. Her <br>action was so much blessed by Allah that the following <br>verse was revealed to the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>-<br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (hence forth) there mav be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed necessary formality (of <br>release) from them.

X: Women's Coumge & Spirit for Islam <br>183 <br>8 3<br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was a very pious <br>.=% <br>lady. She fasted very often and would say her Nafl Salaat <br>Wm <br>very frequently. She earned by working with her hands, <br>and spent all that she earned in the path of Allah. <br>At the time of the Prophet's death, his wives asked <br>him: <br>\"Which of us will join you first?\" <br>Me said: \"The one with long arms.\" <br>They began to measure their arms with a stick. They, how- <br>ever, came to know later that long hands symbolised lavish <br>spending in charity. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was indeed the first to die after the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). <br>Hadhrat Barazah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>Hadhrat \"Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to pay an <br>annual allowance to the Ummahat-ul-Mominin from <br>the Baitul Maal. He sent 12 000 dirhams to Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) through me as her share.<br><br>(refuge of the poor), due to her lavish spending in <br>charity.\" <br>A woman narrates: <br>1 <br>\"I and Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) were <br>dyeing our clothes with red ochre. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) came in, but went out again <br>when he saw us engaged ih dyeing. Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) felt that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had perhaps not liked our dyeing in <br>that colour. She immediately washed all the dyed <br>clothes till their colour was gone.\" <br>Everybody knows the love and liking of women for <br>money and colours. But look at these ladies, who would <br>push away the money coming to them and who were pre- <br>pared to discard any colour on receiving the least hint of <br>the Prophet's disapproval. <br>11. \t Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) Exhorts Her <br>Sons to Bravery.<br><br>to find out if there were any men with the ladies. Hadhrat <br>Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) happened to see the Jew ap- <br>proaching the fort. She said to Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"There is a Jew coming to spy on us. You go out and <br>kill him.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was a weak person. <br>He did not make bold to do the job. Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) got hold of a tent peg and went outside the fortress <br>and gave a blow on the head of the Jew that killed him on <br>the spot. She came back and said to Hassaan: <br>\"The man is dead. I have not removed the clothes and <br>arms from his body for reasons of modesty. Now you <br>go and remove everything from his body. Also bring <br>his head after severing it from the body.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was too weak-<br>hearted to do that even. She herself went again and brought <br>his head, and threw it over the wall amidst the Jews. When <br>they saw this, they said:<br><br>It is reported in a Hadith that once a camel bowed in <br>prostration before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Sahabah on seeing this, said: <br>\"When this animal prostrates before you, why should <br>we not have this honour too?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"Never. If I could make somebody prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah, I would ask the wives to prostrate <br>before their husbands.\" <br>The following is reported to have been said by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in this connection: <br>(1) \"A woman whose husband is pleased with her at <br>the time of her death goes straight into Paradise.\" <br>(2) \t \"A woman is cursed by the angels if her husband <br>is displeased with her, and she stays away from <br>him in anger for the night.\" <br>(3) \t \"The Salaat of two persons hardly rises beyond <br>their heads in its flight to heaven.

She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts.

When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it.

He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah.

The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age She came of age and then accepted Islam She was<br><br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>i<br><br>sounding epithets being used for the open enemies of <br>Islam. When they are reminded, they call it narrow-mind- <br>f<br>edness. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>i <br>\"Don't call a Munafiq a chief. You displease Allah <br>when you take him as a chief.\" <br>22. Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>thi<br>i<br>ld<br>t t k<br>l<br>H<br>fi t h<br>b<br>d<br><br>thes Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's death. She died <br>on the night of Tuesday, the 17th Ramadhan, 57 A. H., at <br>the age of sixty-six. She desired at the time of her death <br>that she might be buried, along with other Ummahat-ul- <br>Momineen, in the public graveyard, though she could be <br>buried by the side of the Prophet's grave, which was in her <br>house. She was the only wife of the Prophet who had not <br>been married previously. All the remaining wives had <br>either been widowed or divorced (some quite a few times) <br>before they became Ummuhat-ul-Momineen. To be married <br>in Shawwal was considered a bad omen among the Arab <br>women. Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was married in Shawwal. It was also Shawwal when <br>I was sent to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasailam). Which of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam's) wives has been more blessed with his love <br>! <br>and Allah's other favours than me?\" <br>Oh the death of Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), <br>Hadhrat Khaulah bint Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said:<br><br>laho anho) who was born in Mecca five years before the <br>Nubuwwat. She was first married to Hadhrat Khunais bin <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho), who was one of the very <br>early Muslims. He first emigrated to Abyssinia and then to <br>Madinah. He participated in Badr, and was fatally <br>wounded in Badr (or in Uhud) and died of the wound in <br>the year 1 or 2 A. H. Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had also emigrated to Madinah with her husband. When <br>her husband died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went <br>to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and said: <br>\"I want to give Hafsah in marriage to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) kept quiet and said <br>nothing. Meanwhile Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) the <br>daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and <br>the wife of 'Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) died. <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat <br>Usman (Radhiyailaho anho) and offered Hadhrat Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho's) hand to him. He declined by saying. <br>\"I have no mind to marry for the present.\" 'Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) complained of this to the Prophet. The <br>Prophet said:<br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>203 <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), for some reason, <br>was displeased with Hafsah and even pronounced the first <br>divorce to her. 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was na- <br>turally very much shocked over this. Jibra-eel Alayhis came <br>to the Prophet (Sallal Salaam laho alaihe wasallam) and <br>said: <br>\"Allah wants you to take Hafsah back, as she is fasting <br>often and spending her nights in Salaat, and also Allah <br>wants it for Hadhrat Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>sake.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) therefore <br>took her back. She died in Jamadil oola, 45 A. H., at the age <br>of 63. <br>(5) Hadhrat Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was the next to be <br>married to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). There <br>are divergent reports about her previous husbands. Accord- <br>ing to one report, she was first married to Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) who was killed in Uhud, <br>as we have already seen in his story in chapter VI1 Accord<br><br>secutions of Qureysh. A son was born to them in exile, who <br>was named Salamah. After returning from Abyssinia, the <br>family emigrated to Madinah. Hadhrat Umme Salamah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) story about her journey to Madinah <br>has been already given in the early part of the chapter. <br>After reaching Madinah, Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) got another son 'Umar and two daughters, <br>Durrah and Zainab (Radhiyallaho anhum). Hadhrat Abu <br>Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) was the eleventh man to em- <br>brace Islam. He participated in the battle of Badr as well as <br>in Uhud. He got a severe wound in Uhud, which did not <br>heal for a long time. He was sent by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in an expedition in Safar, 4 A. H. When <br>he returned from the expedition, the old wound again <br>started giving trouble and at last he died of the same on 8th <br>Jamadil-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was pregnant at the time. Zainab was born to <br>her after the death of her husband. After she had completed <br>her Iddat (waiting period), Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) proposed to marry her, but she declined. <br>Later, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) offered <br>t<br>h<br>Sh<br>id<br>L :\" <br>k \" \t<br>1 <br>i <br>i <br>1<br><br>k5<br>a, oec<br>Ch.

Once I contrived to see her. I found her <br>much more beautiful than I had heard. I mentioned <br>this to Hafsah who said. \"In my opinion, she is not as <br>beautiful as people say.\" <br>She was the last of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam's) wives to die. It was in 59 or 62 A. H. She was 84 at <br>the time of her death, and as, such she was born 9 years <br>before Nubuwwat. <br>As has already been said, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) married her after the death of Hadhrat <br>Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha).

She came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am the daughter of Harith who <br>is the chief of the tribe, and you know my story. The <br>ransom demanded by Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is too much for me. I have come to seek your <br>help in the matter.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to pay her <br>ransom, set her free, and offered to take her as his wife. She <br>was very glad to accept this offer. She was married to the <br>Prophet in 5 A. H. and as a consequence of this marriage, <br>the prisoners of Banu Mustaliq (Juwairiah's tribe), about a <br>hundred families, were all set free by the Muslims. \"The <br>tribe which was so honoured by the Prophet's relation-<br><br>14 <br>recomperised her loss. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) sent her an offer of marriage through the King <br>Negus, who sent a woman named Abrahah to her with the <br>message. She was so happy with the good news that she <br>made over the bracelets and other jewellery that she was <br>wearing to the woman in gratification. King Negrls rep- <br>resented the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the <br>Nikah ceremony, and gave her 400 dinars as her portion <br>and many other things in dowry from himself. He also gave <br>a feast and dinars as gift to all those who were present in <br>the ceremony. The Negus then despatched her to Madinah <br>with her dowry and other gifts such as perfume, etc. This <br>marriage took place in 7 A. H. (Her father was not a Muslim <br>then).

She <br>again saw (in her dream) the sun lying on her breast. When <br>she mentioned this to her husband, he remarked: <br>\"You seem to be wishing to become the Queen of Mad- <br>inah.\" <br>She says: \t \"I was seventeen when I was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>She came to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) when he was camping at the first stage from <br>Khaiber. Next morning, he said to the Sahabah: <br>\"Let everybody bring whatever he has got to eat.'' <br>They brought their own dates, cheese, butter, etc. A long <br>leather sheet was spread and all sat round it to share the <br>food among themselves. This was the Walimah for the mar- <br>riage.<br><br>\"Maimoonah was the most pious, and the most mind- <br>ful of her kith and kin, among the Prophet's wives.\" <br>Hadhrat Yazid bin Asam (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"She was seen either engaged in Salat or in domestic <br>work. When she was doing neither, she was busy in <br>Miswak.\" <br>She was the last woman to be married by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam).

All the children were born from <br>Hadhrat Khadija (Radhivallaho anha), except the son Ibra- <br>him. Qasim was his first son, born to him before Nubuw- <br>wat. He died when he was two.

The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I am naming my child after the name of my forefather <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam).\" <br>This son also died, on 10th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, 10 A. Ii., <br>when he was only 18 months old. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) then remarked: <br>\"Allah has appointed a heavenly nurse to tend to Ibra- <br>hirn in the gardens of Paradise.\" <br>The Daughters of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>(1)Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the eldest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and was born in the fifth year of his first <br>marriage, when he was thirty.

She was married to Utbah, son of <br>Abu Lahab, the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>uncle, but had not yet started living with him when Soorah <br>Al-Lahab was revealed. Abu Lahab called his sons Utbah <br>and Utaibah (to whom Umme Kulsum, another daughter of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam) was married), <br>and said to them: <br>\"Unless you both divorce the daughters of Muham-<br>mad, I am not going to see your faces.\" <br>They divorced their wives. Later, upon the fall of Mecca, <br>Utbah embraced Islam. Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) after this divorce was married to Hadhrat 'Usman <br>(Radhivallaho anho).

It is said <br>that the name Fatimah (lit: safe from fire) was revealed by <br>Allah. She was married to Ali (Radhiyallaho,anho) in 2 A. <br>H. and she began to live with him seven and a half months <br>later. She was about fifteen and Ali was 21 at the time of <br>their union. Of all the daughters, she was the most loved by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); whenever he <br>went out on a journey, she was the last one to part with <br>and when he returned home she was the first one to meet <br>him. When Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) intended to marry Abu <br>Jahal's daughter, she was very much grieved and expressed <br>her grief to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Fatimah is a part of my body. Whoever grieves her, <br>grieves me. \"<br><br>Ch.

He did this so swiftly and incessantly that the <br>bandits thought they were being chased by a large number <br>of people. If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow.

Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims.

'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).

At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah!

But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah:<br><br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver!

If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow. The bandits at once retreated at <br>full speed to escape from being captured. Salmah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I kept on chasing the bandits till all the camels taken <br>away by them were behind me. Besides, in their flight <br>they left behind 30 spears and 30 sheets of cloth of <br>their own. Meanwhile, Uyainah bin Hisn (another <br>bandit) and his party arrived on the scene to reinforce <br>the bandits. They had meanwhile come to know that I <br>was all alone. They now chased me in large concentra- <br>tion and I was compelled to climb up a hill. As they <br>were about to approach me I shouted, 'Stop. First <br>listen to me. Do you know who am I?

Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them.

Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims.

Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here-<br><br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels.

At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah!

But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah:<br><br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>1 <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh!

The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves.<br><br>Ch.

Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East.

Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\"<br><br>"

My father, however, participated in the battle and was <br>killed. He left me nothing to live on. I went to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to seek some financial help <br>from him. Before I could express myself, he addressed me <br>saying: <br>'Abu Saeed!

He did this so swiftly and incessantly that the <br>bandits thought they were being chased by a large number <br>of people. If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow. The bandits at once retreated at <br>full speed to escape from being captured. Salmah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I kept on chasing the bandits till all the camels taken <br>away by them were behind me. Besides, in their flight <br>they left behind 30 spears and 30 sheets of cloth of <br>their own. Meanwhile, Uyainah bin Hisn (another <br>bandit) and his party arrived on the scene to reinforce <br>the bandits. They had meanwhile come to know that I <br>was all alone. They now chased me in large concentra- <br>tion and I was compelled to climb up a hill. As they <br>were about to approach me I shouted, 'Stop. First <br>listen to me. Do you know who am I?

Let me have one hundred men, I <br>shall teach them a lesson.\" <br>But the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. They would have by now reached their bases.\" <br>Most of the historians say that Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was hardly 12 or 13 at that time. Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them. This was the outcome of Iman and <br>Ikhlas, with which Allah had imbued the hearts of those <br>blessed people. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Bara's (Radhiyallaho anho) eagerness to Join <br>in Badr. <br>Badr was the most gallant and illustrious battle ever <br>f<br>ht b<br>th<br>M<br>li<br>h<br>f<br>d<br>ith<br>h<br><br>Ch.

Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus:<br><br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>t t<br>t<br>d t<br>k<br>ti<br>i<br>t hi<br>Wh<br>Z id (R d<br><br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle.

Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>1 <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage 100 000 dinars in prize and also<br><br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood.<br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion .to Islam <br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal<br><br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam).

When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading I desire you to learn the Jewish lan-<br><br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'.

On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah:<br><br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>1 <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>1 <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the<br><br>lam) that the blood had been disposed of. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves.<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory<br><br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\"<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>The father and uncle were quite satisfied with the situation <br>and gladly left Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and returned without him. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was only a child at that time. <br>His preferring to remain a slave, and refusing to go with his <br>own father giving up his home and kith and kin is an ob- <br>vious tribute to his love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). <br>8. \t<br>Anas bin Nadhr's (Radhiyallaho anho) Martyrdom in <br>Uhud. <br>When the Muslims were facing defeat in Uhud, some- <br>body started the rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had been killed. You can imagine the Sahabah's <br>grief and anguish over this tragic news. This, quite natu- <br>rally, caused most of them to lose heart in despair. Anas <br>bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to see 'Umar and <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) with a group of Muslims in <br>a state of utter bewilderment. He said to them: <br>\"Why am I seeing you all so bewildered?\"<br><br>"

Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them.

XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>As we have already seen, both these boys were also re- <br>jected for the same reason at the time of Uhud, which took <br>place one year after Badr. Look at the wonderful spirit of <br>the youngsters of that time that they were anxious to obtain <br>permission for participating in every battle. <br>11. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus:<br><br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>t t<br>t<br>d t<br>k<br>ti<br>i<br>t hi<br>Wh<br>Z id (R d<br><br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>1 <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage 100 000 dinars in prize and also<br><br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood.<br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion .to Islam <br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal<br><br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger<br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>235 <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading I desire you to learn the Jewish lan-<br><br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah!

He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here-<br><br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>A Ab<br>B k (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>d<br>i<br>d<br>b<br><br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah!

XII: Love for the Prophet <br>247 <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them.

The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles.

Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>1 <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage 100 000 dinars in prize and also<br><br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16.

XI: Children's Devotion .to Islam <br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal<br><br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger<br><br>Ch.

That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading I desire you to learn the Jewish lan-<br><br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah!

He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here-<br><br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>A Ab<br>B k (R dhi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>d<br>i<br>d<br>b<br><br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>th<br>i<br>t \"<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>247 <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah:<br><br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>1 <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>1 <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the<br><br>lam) that the blood had been disposed of. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves.<br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory<br><br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\"<br><br>Ch.

            "content": "12 <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Ch<br>t<br>VIII Z<br>l f<br>k<br>l d<br><br>2 <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town<br><br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh accepting their conditions in full<br><br>"

Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>h )<br>d hi<br>h i<br>b<br>k<br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>21 <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah<br><br>"

His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>l h<br>l ih) t<br>fi<br>thi<br>d<br>f hi<br>H<br>d<br>it<br>t i<br><br>FOREWORD <br>11<br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence<br><br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading For instance on ayaat con<br><br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help.<br><br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2<br><br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3<br><br>1<br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with<br><br>"

According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise"

If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help.<br><br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2<br><br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself.

'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with<br><br>Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>22 <br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8.

If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise<br><br>"

If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence<br><br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading For instance on ayaat con<br><br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help.<br><br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2<br><br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3<br><br>1<br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with<br><br>Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>22 <br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8. The Qur'an pleads <br>in the Court of Allah for increasing the sfatus of those who <br>abide by it, and-takes to task those who neglect it. If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise<br><br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>23 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>h<br>Ul<br>h<br>l<br>d b<br>f<br>h<br>hi<br>d<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast<br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"H<br>i l<br>d<br>b<br>thi<br>B<br>k<br>d<br>id<br><br>The Holy Prophet's exhortation for reciting <br>the Holy Qur'an day and night . . .. . . . . . . . . . . <br>63 <br>An extract from the Torah. .............. . .. <br>65 <br>28 <br>The Holy Qur'an contains the essence of all <br>previous Revelations-and more.

An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>1<br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>"

There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast<br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah.

An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>1<br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>h<br>i<br>di i<br>i<br>d<br>h<br>d<br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>33 <br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the<br><br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>35 <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says:<br><br>"

If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence<br><br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading For instance on ayaat con<br><br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help.<br><br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2<br><br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3<br><br>1<br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with<br><br>Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>22 <br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8. The Qur'an pleads <br>in the Court of Allah for increasing the sfatus of those who <br>abide by it, and-takes to task those who neglect it. If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise<br><br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>23 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>h<br>Ul<br>h<br>l<br>d b<br>f<br>h<br>hi<br>d<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast<br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"H<br>i l<br>d<br>b<br>thi<br>B<br>k<br>d<br>id<br><br>The Holy Prophet's exhortation for reciting <br>the Holy Qur'an day and night . . .. . . . . . . . . . . <br>63 <br>An extract from the Torah. .............. . .. <br>65 <br>28 <br>The Holy Qur'an contains the essence of all <br>previous Revelations-and more.

An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>1<br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>h<br>i<br>di i<br>i<br>d<br>h<br>d<br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>33 <br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the<br><br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>35 <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says:<br><br>36 <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings. There is a differeilce of opinion anlong scholars <br>whether 'dl'(alif laam meem) is the beginning of Surah<br><br>Contents <br>Hadith No: <br>Page No: <br>34 <br>35 <br>No interceder shall be better than the Holy <br>Qur'an . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>Protection afforded by the Qur'an in the <br>grave . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>One who reads the Holy Qur'an secures in <br>his heart the knowledge of prophethood ..... <br>76 <br>77 <br>77 <br>36 <br>Three persons shall be strolling on mounds <br>of musk ................................. <br>78 <br>37 <br>Learning of one ayat is more rewarding than <br>hundred raka'at of Nafl Salaat .............. <br>79 <br>38 <br>One who recites ten ayaat shall not be reck- <br>oned among the neglectful ...............:. <br>80<br><br>20 <br>alaih) that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had reported <br>the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Whoever teaches the reading of Qur'an to his son (without <br>memorizing it), all his sins, whether previous or subse-<br>quent, will be forgiven; and whoever makes his child mem- <br>orize the Qur'an will be raised on the Day of Judgement in <br>the semblance of a full moon; and his son will be asked to <br>start reciting, and for every ayat read by the child, the <br>status of the parent will be raised to the next higher grade <br>of jannat, till the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is com- <br>pleted.\" <br>Such are the blessings for teaching the Qur'an to your <br>children. This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on<br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>39 <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica-<br><br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell \"<br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>41 <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14<br><br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In<br><br>2.3 <br>Part I (Hadith 17) <br>43 <br>the Qur'an in salaat is more rewarding than the recita- <br>tion outside salaat; recitation outside salaat is prefer- <br>able to tasbeeh and takbeer (repeating words of Praise <br>for Allah); tasbeeh is superior to sadaqah (alms); sada- <br>= <br>qah to sowm (fasting) and sowm is protection against <br>Fire.\" <br>o L <br>The superiority of recitation of the Qur'an over zikr $? <br>(glorification and remembrance of Allah) is evident be- 5~ <br>cause Qur'an is the Word oi Allah. As mentioned earlier, <br>the superiority of the Word of Allah over the speech of <br>others is like His superiority over His creation. The superi- <br>ority of zikr over sadaqah has been stressed in other aha- <br>dith as well. But the superiority of sadaqah over sowm as <br>given in this hadith, seems contrary to that given in some <br>other ahadith where sowm is said to be better than sada- <br>qah.' This difference is due to the variations in the type of <br>people and their conditions of life. <br>According to this hadith sowm comes last in the order <br>of merit. When sowm is protection against the Fire of Hell, <br>we can imagine numerous blessing of the recitation of <br>Q<br>'<br><br>morevirtuous ............................ <br>44 <br>17 \t The reward of reciting three ayaat in Salaat <br>45 <br>18 \t Rewards of visual recitation and recitation <br>by memory .. . ............ . .. . ...... . . . .. <br>45 <br>19 \t Recitation of Qur'an cleans the rust of hearts <br>47 <br>20 \t The Holy Qur'an is the honour and distinc-<br>tion of Muslims I.. . . . ... . . . ...... . . . ... . .. <br>48 <br>21 \t<br>Secitation of the Holy Qur'an is Nur (efful- <br>gence) in the life and a provision in the <br>Hereafter ... . .... . . . . .... . . . . . . . .... . ... . <br>49 <br>Houses of recitation shine like the moon and <br>stars, for those in Heaven ..... . .. . . . .. . .... <br>50 <br>Number and subject-matter of Heavenly <br>Booklets and Divine books .. . ......... . .... <br>51 <br>22 \t<br>Descent of Sakinah and mercy upon, and the <br>surrounding by Angels of a group engaged <br>in recitation of the Holy Qur'an ........ . . ... <br>53 <br>/ <br>I <br>, <br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 19) <br>45 <br>the Book. By reason of other ahadith, and because reciting <br>from memory is conducive to greater devotion and is free <br>from riyaa' (dissimulation) and because this was the way of <br>recitation of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self, some scholars consider that reciting from memory is $-3<br>preferable. Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) has decided <br>0 2 <br>that the preference between the two depends upon the in- <br>dividuals. Some people concentrate and meditate better <br>Z Q<br>T x<br>while reading from the Book, while others do so, reciting <br>from memory. Therefore, reading from the Book is prefer- <br>able for some and reciting from memory for others. Hafiz <br>Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah alaih) also has favoured this inter- <br>pretation in his book 'Fat-hul Baari.' <br>It is said that on account of excessive reading by Hadh- <br>rat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) two scripts of the Holy <br>Qur'an tore. Amr ibn Maimoon (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>mentioned in 'Sharhul Ihya', that one who opens the Holy <br>Qur'an after Fajr (dawn) salaat and reads a hundred ayaat <br>gets a reward as large as the entire world. Reading the <br>Qur'an by looking into it is reported to be beneficial for <br>eyesight. Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated a lengthy hadith in which each reporter says that<br><br>The reading of Qur'an and the remembrance of death <br>polish the rusted hearts. The heart is like a mirror. If it is <br>not cleaned, it will not properly reflect the recognition of <br>Allah. The more burnished and brighter it is, the better will <br>it show from the enlightenment. Therefore, the more we in- <br>dulge in sinful lust and devilish acts, the more are we de- <br>prived of the recognition of Almighty Allah. It is with a <br>view to polishing the mirror of the heart that mashaa'ikh <br>enjoin upon their disciples to devote themselves to self-dis- <br>cipline endeavours, spiritual occupation, incantation and <br>remembrance of Allah. <br>It is mentioned in some ahadith that when a man com- <br>mits a sin, a black dot stains his heart. If he repents in real <br>earnest, this dot is removed, but if he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears. In this way, if he goes on com- <br>mitting sin after sin, his heart gets completely blackened. <br>At this stage the heart becomes quite disinclined to do <br>good!, and keeps on turning to evil.<br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 20) <br>47 <br>you exercise particular care to pronounce its words and <br>vowels correctly, but do not take it as the Commandment of <br>Allah, and do not contemplate over it.\" <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Certainly <br>there is always a thing in which people take pride. <br>And that which is glory and pride for my Umlnat is the <br>Holy Qur'an.\" <br>People indicate their nobility and dignity by virtue of <br>their lineage, their familv and other similar things. ?'he <br>Qur'an is the source of nobility and pride for the Ummat in <br>the sense that reading, memorizing and teaching it, as also <br>acting upon it; in short, everything related to it, confers an <br>honour upon them. Why should it not be so? After all, it is <br>the Word of the Beloved and the Commandment of the <br>Master<br>Its dignity excels all worldly honours<br>however<br><br>and satisfaction. Even if a few of the above excellent quali- <br>ties were to be found in any composition, we would be all <br>praise for it. So, if all these qualities were present in a com- <br>position to a perfect degree, surely it would have to be re- <br>garded with the greatest honour and pride. <br>Now, we should just reflect on our own condition. <br>How many of us feel really proud of having memorized the <br>whole Qur'an? Does a hafiz command real respect in our <br>eyes? Alas! our honour and pride lie in high university de- <br>grees, in big titles, in worldly pomp and show, and in the <br>wealth which we will have to leave behind us on our <br>death. 0,Allah! have mercy up011 us. <br>HADITH- 21<br><br>Part I (Hadith 21) <br>49 <br>Qur'an is read shine unto the inhabitants of the Heaven as <br>do the stars shine unto the inhabitants of the Earth. <br>This hadith, which has been quoted from 'At-Targhib', <br>is only a part of a long hadith reported from Ibn Hibban by <br>2<br>Mulla Ali Qari in detail and by Suyuti in brief. Although :<br>P <br>the above-mentioned part of the hadith is sufficient for the <br>5 <br>purpose of this book. yet the whole hadith includes many <br>3 <br>essential and useful subjects and, therefore, its subject- - . P<br>matter is given in the following paragraphs. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anha) says that he in- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallamj about <br>the number of books revealed by Almighty Allah. Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"One hundred <br>booklets and four books. Fifty booklets were revealed to <br>Hadhrat Sheeth (Alaihis salaam) (peace be upon him), <br>thirty to Hadhrat Idrees (Alaihis salaam), ten to Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam) and ten to Hadhrat Musa (Alaihis <br>salaam) before the Torah. In addition. four books, i.e., the <br>Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Holy Qur'an have <br>been revealed by Almighty Allah.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Rad- <br>hi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>i<br>d b<br>h<br>f h b<br>kl<br><br>\"Beware of the sigh of those oppressed, when they <br>Pray 9 <br>Divine acceptance readily greets them. <br>These booklets also mentioned that it is incumbent on <br>a wise man, unless he is deprived of sanity, to divide his <br>time in three parts: one for worship of his Lord; one for <br>self-reckoning to consider what acts, good or bad, he did <br>and one for his lawful earning of livelihood. It is also in- <br>cumbent upon him to watch of his time and be thoughtful <br>about improving his conditions and to guard his tongue <br>against unnecessary and useless talk. Whoever keeps a <br>check on his own speech, his tongue will indulge less in <br>useless talk. <br>Also, a wise man should not travel except for three <br>purposes. viz., for making provision for the life Hereafter, <br>or in search of livelihood, or for such recreation as is per- <br>missible. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) then enquired <br>about the contents of the booklets revealed to Hadhrat <br>Musa (Alaihis salaam) Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal<br><br>Part I (Hadith 22) <br>51 <br>much of laughter, because it causes the heart to wither, and <br>the face loses its lustre.\" (Too much of laughter is injurious <br>both for the outward and inward disposition of man.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) sought further <br>S <br>advice, whereupon Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) -: <br>said, \"Stick to jihaad because this is the rahbaaniyyat of my <br>g 6 <br>ummat.\" (Rahbaan - singular raahib - were those people of <br>3<br>.!> x<br>previous ~ ~ ~ n m a t s  <br>who severed all their worldly connec-<br>tions and turned towards Allah.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked for more <br>advice and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Associate yourself with the poor and the needy, be <br>friendly with them and sit in their company.\" When Hadh- <br>rat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) requested further advice, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Look to-<br>wards those who rank below you (so that you may get used <br>to being thankful) and do not look at those who rank above <br>you, lest you should despise the favours of Allah upon <br>you.\" <br>When Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>k d f<br>d i<br>R<br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>l<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Never do a people collect in one of the houses of <br>I <br>Allah (mosque) reciting the Qur'an and reading it out <br>to one another, but sakeenah (tranquillity) descends <br>1 <br>upon them, rahmat (mercy) enshrouds them, the angels <br>throng around them and Almighty Allah mentions <br>them, in the assembly of angels.\" <br>!<br>This hadith describes the special virtues of religious <br>schools and institutions. Acquisition of either reward men- <br>tioned above is so sublime that even if one devotes his <br>whole life to acquire it, it will be worth while. But here <br>there are so many rewards, especially the last one.

Its sub- <br>stance is that sulook ilallaah (the path of mystics towards <br>Allah) which is also.called the stage of Ihsaan can be at- <br>tained in three ways:- <br>, (1) 'Tasawwur', known as meditation in Sharee'at and <br>muraqabah in the terminology of mystics. <br>(2) Remembrance of \t Allah by repeating words of <br>praise for Him. <br>(3) \t Reading of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Since the first method is remembrance in the heart, so <br>there remain in fact two ways only; first the remembrance <br>by heart or by word of mouth, and secondly recitation of <br>the Qur'an. The essence of zikr is that the word which is <br>used for or refers to Almighty Allah should be repeated <br>over and over again. This repetition helps the mudrakah <br>(the faculty of understanding) in concentrating upon the <br>person of the one being remembered. It would give rise to a<br><br>"

In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3<br><br>1<br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with<br><br>Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>22 <br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8. The Qur'an pleads <br>in the Court of Allah for increasing the sfatus of those who <br>abide by it, and-takes to task those who neglect it. If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise<br><br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>23 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>h<br>Ul<br>h<br>l<br>d b<br>f<br>h<br>hi<br>d<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast<br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah.

An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>1<br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>h<br>i<br>di i<br>i<br>d<br>h<br>d<br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>33 <br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the<br><br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>35 <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says:<br><br>36 <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings. There is a differeilce of opinion anlong scholars <br>whether 'dl'(alif laam meem) is the beginning of Surah<br><br>Contents <br>Hadith No: <br>Page No: <br>34 <br>35 <br>No interceder shall be better than the Holy <br>Qur'an . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>Protection afforded by the Qur'an in the <br>grave . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>One who reads the Holy Qur'an secures in <br>his heart the knowledge of prophethood ..... <br>76 <br>77 <br>77 <br>36 <br>Three persons shall be strolling on mounds <br>of musk ................................. <br>78 <br>37 <br>Learning of one ayat is more rewarding than <br>hundred raka'at of Nafl Salaat .............. <br>79 <br>38 <br>One who recites ten ayaat shall not be reck- <br>oned among the neglectful ...............:. <br>80<br><br>20 <br>alaih) that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had reported <br>the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Whoever teaches the reading of Qur'an to his son (without <br>memorizing it), all his sins, whether previous or subse-<br>quent, will be forgiven; and whoever makes his child mem- <br>orize the Qur'an will be raised on the Day of Judgement in <br>the semblance of a full moon; and his son will be asked to <br>start reciting, and for every ayat read by the child, the <br>status of the parent will be raised to the next higher grade <br>of jannat, till the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is com- <br>pleted.\" <br>Such are the blessings for teaching the Qur'an to your <br>children. This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on<br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>39 <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica-<br><br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell \"<br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>41 <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14<br><br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In<br><br>2.3 <br>Part I (Hadith 17) <br>43 <br>the Qur'an in salaat is more rewarding than the recita- <br>tion outside salaat; recitation outside salaat is prefer- <br>able to tasbeeh and takbeer (repeating words of Praise <br>for Allah); tasbeeh is superior to sadaqah (alms); sada- <br>= <br>qah to sowm (fasting) and sowm is protection against <br>Fire.\" <br>o L <br>The superiority of recitation of the Qur'an over zikr $? <br>(glorification and remembrance of Allah) is evident be- 5~ <br>cause Qur'an is the Word oi Allah. As mentioned earlier, <br>the superiority of the Word of Allah over the speech of <br>others is like His superiority over His creation. The superi- <br>ority of zikr over sadaqah has been stressed in other aha- <br>dith as well. But the superiority of sadaqah over sowm as <br>given in this hadith, seems contrary to that given in some <br>other ahadith where sowm is said to be better than sada- <br>qah.' This difference is due to the variations in the type of <br>people and their conditions of life. <br>According to this hadith sowm comes last in the order <br>of merit. When sowm is protection against the Fire of Hell, <br>we can imagine numerous blessing of the recitation of <br>Q<br>'<br><br>"

            "content": "1<br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with<br><br>Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>22 <br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8. The Qur'an pleads <br>in the Court of Allah for increasing the sfatus of those who <br>abide by it, and-takes to task those who neglect it. If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise<br><br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>23 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>h<br>Ul<br>h<br>l<br>d b<br>f<br>h<br>hi<br>d<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast<br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah.

The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>h<br>i<br>di i<br>i<br>d<br>h<br>d<br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>33 <br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the<br><br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>35 <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says:<br><br>36 <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings. There is a differeilce of opinion anlong scholars <br>whether 'dl'(alif laam meem) is the beginning of Surah<br><br>Contents <br>Hadith No: <br>Page No: <br>34 <br>35 <br>No interceder shall be better than the Holy <br>Qur'an . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>Protection afforded by the Qur'an in the <br>grave . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>One who reads the Holy Qur'an secures in <br>his heart the knowledge of prophethood ..... <br>76 <br>77 <br>77 <br>36 <br>Three persons shall be strolling on mounds <br>of musk ................................. <br>78 <br>37 <br>Learning of one ayat is more rewarding than <br>hundred raka'at of Nafl Salaat .............. <br>79 <br>38 <br>One who recites ten ayaat shall not be reck- <br>oned among the neglectful ...............:. <br>80<br><br>20 <br>alaih) that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had reported <br>the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Whoever teaches the reading of Qur'an to his son (without <br>memorizing it), all his sins, whether previous or subse-<br>quent, will be forgiven; and whoever makes his child mem- <br>orize the Qur'an will be raised on the Day of Judgement in <br>the semblance of a full moon; and his son will be asked to <br>start reciting, and for every ayat read by the child, the <br>status of the parent will be raised to the next higher grade <br>of jannat, till the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is com- <br>pleted.\" <br>Such are the blessings for teaching the Qur'an to your <br>children. This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on<br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>39 <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica-<br><br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell \"<br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>41 <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14<br><br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In<br><br>2.3 <br>Part I (Hadith 17) <br>43 <br>the Qur'an in salaat is more rewarding than the recita- <br>tion outside salaat; recitation outside salaat is prefer- <br>able to tasbeeh and takbeer (repeating words of Praise <br>for Allah); tasbeeh is superior to sadaqah (alms); sada- <br>= <br>qah to sowm (fasting) and sowm is protection against <br>Fire.\" <br>o L <br>The superiority of recitation of the Qur'an over zikr $? <br>(glorification and remembrance of Allah) is evident be- 5~ <br>cause Qur'an is the Word oi Allah. As mentioned earlier, <br>the superiority of the Word of Allah over the speech of <br>others is like His superiority over His creation. The superi- <br>ority of zikr over sadaqah has been stressed in other aha- <br>dith as well. But the superiority of sadaqah over sowm as <br>given in this hadith, seems contrary to that given in some <br>other ahadith where sowm is said to be better than sada- <br>qah.' This difference is due to the variations in the type of <br>people and their conditions of life. <br>According to this hadith sowm comes last in the order <br>of merit. When sowm is protection against the Fire of Hell, <br>we can imagine numerous blessing of the recitation of <br>Q<br>'<br><br>morevirtuous ............................ <br>44 <br>17 \t The reward of reciting three ayaat in Salaat <br>45 <br>18 \t Rewards of visual recitation and recitation <br>by memory .. . ............ . .. . ...... . . . .. <br>45 <br>19 \t Recitation of Qur'an cleans the rust of hearts <br>47 <br>20 \t The Holy Qur'an is the honour and distinc-<br>tion of Muslims I.. . . . ... . . . ...... . . . ... . .. <br>48 <br>21 \t<br>Secitation of the Holy Qur'an is Nur (efful- <br>gence) in the life and a provision in the <br>Hereafter ... . .... . . . . .... . . . . . . . .... . ... . <br>49 <br>Houses of recitation shine like the moon and <br>stars, for those in Heaven ..... . .. . . . .. . .... <br>50 <br>Number and subject-matter of Heavenly <br>Booklets and Divine books .. . ......... . .... <br>51 <br>22 \t<br>Descent of Sakinah and mercy upon, and the <br>surrounding by Angels of a group engaged <br>in recitation of the Holy Qur'an ........ . . ... <br>53 <br>/ <br>I <br>, <br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 19) <br>45 <br>the Book. By reason of other ahadith, and because reciting <br>from memory is conducive to greater devotion and is free <br>from riyaa' (dissimulation) and because this was the way of <br>recitation of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self, some scholars consider that reciting from memory is $-3<br>preferable. Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) has decided <br>0 2 <br>that the preference between the two depends upon the in- <br>dividuals. Some people concentrate and meditate better <br>Z Q<br>T x<br>while reading from the Book, while others do so, reciting <br>from memory. Therefore, reading from the Book is prefer- <br>able for some and reciting from memory for others. Hafiz <br>Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah alaih) also has favoured this inter- <br>pretation in his book 'Fat-hul Baari.' <br>It is said that on account of excessive reading by Hadh- <br>rat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) two scripts of the Holy <br>Qur'an tore. Amr ibn Maimoon (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>mentioned in 'Sharhul Ihya', that one who opens the Holy <br>Qur'an after Fajr (dawn) salaat and reads a hundred ayaat <br>gets a reward as large as the entire world. Reading the <br>Qur'an by looking into it is reported to be beneficial for <br>eyesight. Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated a lengthy hadith in which each reporter says that<br><br>The reading of Qur'an and the remembrance of death <br>polish the rusted hearts. The heart is like a mirror. If it is <br>not cleaned, it will not properly reflect the recognition of <br>Allah. The more burnished and brighter it is, the better will <br>it show from the enlightenment. Therefore, the more we in- <br>dulge in sinful lust and devilish acts, the more are we de- <br>prived of the recognition of Almighty Allah. It is with a <br>view to polishing the mirror of the heart that mashaa'ikh <br>enjoin upon their disciples to devote themselves to self-dis- <br>cipline endeavours, spiritual occupation, incantation and <br>remembrance of Allah. <br>It is mentioned in some ahadith that when a man com- <br>mits a sin, a black dot stains his heart. If he repents in real <br>earnest, this dot is removed, but if he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears. In this way, if he goes on com- <br>mitting sin after sin, his heart gets completely blackened. <br>At this stage the heart becomes quite disinclined to do <br>good!, and keeps on turning to evil.<br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 20) <br>47 <br>you exercise particular care to pronounce its words and <br>vowels correctly, but do not take it as the Commandment of <br>Allah, and do not contemplate over it.\" <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Certainly <br>there is always a thing in which people take pride. <br>And that which is glory and pride for my Umlnat is the <br>Holy Qur'an.\" <br>People indicate their nobility and dignity by virtue of <br>their lineage, their familv and other similar things. ?'he <br>Qur'an is the source of nobility and pride for the Ummat in <br>the sense that reading, memorizing and teaching it, as also <br>acting upon it; in short, everything related to it, confers an <br>honour upon them. Why should it not be so? After all, it is <br>the Word of the Beloved and the Commandment of the <br>Master<br>Its dignity excels all worldly honours<br>however<br><br>and satisfaction. Even if a few of the above excellent quali- <br>ties were to be found in any composition, we would be all <br>praise for it. So, if all these qualities were present in a com- <br>position to a perfect degree, surely it would have to be re- <br>garded with the greatest honour and pride. <br>Now, we should just reflect on our own condition. <br>How many of us feel really proud of having memorized the <br>whole Qur'an? Does a hafiz command real respect in our <br>eyes? Alas! our honour and pride lie in high university de- <br>grees, in big titles, in worldly pomp and show, and in the <br>wealth which we will have to leave behind us on our <br>death. 0,Allah! have mercy up011 us. <br>HADITH- 21<br><br>Part I (Hadith 21) <br>49 <br>Qur'an is read shine unto the inhabitants of the Heaven as <br>do the stars shine unto the inhabitants of the Earth. <br>This hadith, which has been quoted from 'At-Targhib', <br>is only a part of a long hadith reported from Ibn Hibban by <br>2<br>Mulla Ali Qari in detail and by Suyuti in brief. Although :<br>P <br>the above-mentioned part of the hadith is sufficient for the <br>5 <br>purpose of this book. yet the whole hadith includes many <br>3 <br>essential and useful subjects and, therefore, its subject- - . P<br>matter is given in the following paragraphs. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anha) says that he in- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallamj about <br>the number of books revealed by Almighty Allah. Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"One hundred <br>booklets and four books. Fifty booklets were revealed to <br>Hadhrat Sheeth (Alaihis salaam) (peace be upon him), <br>thirty to Hadhrat Idrees (Alaihis salaam), ten to Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam) and ten to Hadhrat Musa (Alaihis <br>salaam) before the Torah. In addition. four books, i.e., the <br>Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Holy Qur'an have <br>been revealed by Almighty Allah.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Rad- <br>hi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>i<br>d b<br>h<br>f h b<br>kl<br><br>"

            "content": "Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>22 <br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8. The Qur'an pleads <br>in the Court of Allah for increasing the sfatus of those who <br>abide by it, and-takes to task those who neglect it. If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise<br><br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>23 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>h<br>Ul<br>h<br>l<br>d b<br>f<br>h<br>hi<br>d<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast<br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>25 <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"H<br>i l<br>d<br>b<br>thi<br>B<br>k<br>d<br>id<br><br>The Holy Prophet's exhortation for reciting <br>the Holy Qur'an day and night . . .. . . . . . . . . . . <br>63 <br>An extract from the Torah. .............. . .. <br>65 <br>28 <br>The Holy Qur'an contains the essence of all <br>previous Revelations-and more.

An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>1<br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>h<br>i<br>di i<br>i<br>d<br>h<br>d<br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>33 <br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the<br><br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>35 <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says:<br><br>36 <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings.

This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on<br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>39 <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica-<br><br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell \"<br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>41 <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14<br><br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In<br><br>2.3 <br>Part I (Hadith 17) <br>43 <br>the Qur'an in salaat is more rewarding than the recita- <br>tion outside salaat; recitation outside salaat is prefer- <br>able to tasbeeh and takbeer (repeating words of Praise <br>for Allah); tasbeeh is superior to sadaqah (alms); sada- <br>= <br>qah to sowm (fasting) and sowm is protection against <br>Fire.\" <br>o L <br>The superiority of recitation of the Qur'an over zikr $? <br>(glorification and remembrance of Allah) is evident be- 5~ <br>cause Qur'an is the Word oi Allah. As mentioned earlier, <br>the superiority of the Word of Allah over the speech of <br>others is like His superiority over His creation. The superi- <br>ority of zikr over sadaqah has been stressed in other aha- <br>dith as well. But the superiority of sadaqah over sowm as <br>given in this hadith, seems contrary to that given in some <br>other ahadith where sowm is said to be better than sada- <br>qah.' This difference is due to the variations in the type of <br>people and their conditions of life. <br>According to this hadith sowm comes last in the order <br>of merit. When sowm is protection against the Fire of Hell, <br>we can imagine numerous blessing of the recitation of <br>Q<br>'<br><br>morevirtuous ............................ <br>44 <br>17 \t The reward of reciting three ayaat in Salaat <br>45 <br>18 \t Rewards of visual recitation and recitation <br>by memory .. . ............ . .. . ...... . . . .. <br>45 <br>19 \t Recitation of Qur'an cleans the rust of hearts <br>47 <br>20 \t The Holy Qur'an is the honour and distinc-<br>tion of Muslims I.. . . . ... . . . ...... . . . ... . .. <br>48 <br>21 \t<br>Secitation of the Holy Qur'an is Nur (efful- <br>gence) in the life and a provision in the <br>Hereafter ... . .... . . . . .... . . . . . . . .... . ... . <br>49 <br>Houses of recitation shine like the moon and <br>stars, for those in Heaven ..... . .. . . . .. . .... <br>50 <br>Number and subject-matter of Heavenly <br>Booklets and Divine books .. . ......... . .... <br>51 <br>22 \t<br>Descent of Sakinah and mercy upon, and the <br>surrounding by Angels of a group engaged <br>in recitation of the Holy Qur'an ........ . . ... <br>53 <br>/ <br>I <br>, <br>i<br><br>Part I (Hadith 19) <br>45 <br>the Book. By reason of other ahadith, and because reciting <br>from memory is conducive to greater devotion and is free <br>from riyaa' (dissimulation) and because this was the way of <br>recitation of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self, some scholars consider that reciting from memory is $-3<br>preferable. Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) has decided <br>0 2 <br>that the preference between the two depends upon the in- <br>dividuals. Some people concentrate and meditate better <br>Z Q<br>T x<br>while reading from the Book, while others do so, reciting <br>from memory. Therefore, reading from the Book is prefer- <br>able for some and reciting from memory for others. Hafiz <br>Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah alaih) also has favoured this inter- <br>pretation in his book 'Fat-hul Baari.' <br>It is said that on account of excessive reading by Hadh- <br>rat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) two scripts of the Holy <br>Qur'an tore. Amr ibn Maimoon (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>mentioned in 'Sharhul Ihya', that one who opens the Holy <br>Qur'an after Fajr (dawn) salaat and reads a hundred ayaat <br>gets a reward as large as the entire world. Reading the <br>Qur'an by looking into it is reported to be beneficial for <br>eyesight. Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated a lengthy hadith in which each reporter says that<br><br>The reading of Qur'an and the remembrance of death <br>polish the rusted hearts. The heart is like a mirror. If it is <br>not cleaned, it will not properly reflect the recognition of <br>Allah. The more burnished and brighter it is, the better will <br>it show from the enlightenment. Therefore, the more we in- <br>dulge in sinful lust and devilish acts, the more are we de- <br>prived of the recognition of Almighty Allah. It is with a <br>view to polishing the mirror of the heart that mashaa'ikh <br>enjoin upon their disciples to devote themselves to self-dis- <br>cipline endeavours, spiritual occupation, incantation and <br>remembrance of Allah. <br>It is mentioned in some ahadith that when a man com- <br>mits a sin, a black dot stains his heart. If he repents in real <br>earnest, this dot is removed, but if he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears. In this way, if he goes on com- <br>mitting sin after sin, his heart gets completely blackened. <br>At this stage the heart becomes quite disinclined to do <br>good!, and keeps on turning to evil.<br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 20) <br>47 <br>you exercise particular care to pronounce its words and <br>vowels correctly, but do not take it as the Commandment of <br>Allah, and do not contemplate over it.\" <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Certainly <br>there is always a thing in which people take pride. <br>And that which is glory and pride for my Umlnat is the <br>Holy Qur'an.\" <br>People indicate their nobility and dignity by virtue of <br>their lineage, their familv and other similar things. ?'he <br>Qur'an is the source of nobility and pride for the Ummat in <br>the sense that reading, memorizing and teaching it, as also <br>acting upon it; in short, everything related to it, confers an <br>honour upon them. Why should it not be so? After all, it is <br>the Word of the Beloved and the Commandment of the <br>Master<br>Its dignity excels all worldly honours<br>however<br><br>and satisfaction. Even if a few of the above excellent quali- <br>ties were to be found in any composition, we would be all <br>praise for it. So, if all these qualities were present in a com- <br>position to a perfect degree, surely it would have to be re- <br>garded with the greatest honour and pride. <br>Now, we should just reflect on our own condition. <br>How many of us feel really proud of having memorized the <br>whole Qur'an? Does a hafiz command real respect in our <br>eyes? Alas! our honour and pride lie in high university de- <br>grees, in big titles, in worldly pomp and show, and in the <br>wealth which we will have to leave behind us on our <br>death. 0,Allah! have mercy up011 us. <br>HADITH- 21<br><br>Part I (Hadith 21) <br>49 <br>Qur'an is read shine unto the inhabitants of the Heaven as <br>do the stars shine unto the inhabitants of the Earth. <br>This hadith, which has been quoted from 'At-Targhib', <br>is only a part of a long hadith reported from Ibn Hibban by <br>2<br>Mulla Ali Qari in detail and by Suyuti in brief. Although :<br>P <br>the above-mentioned part of the hadith is sufficient for the <br>5 <br>purpose of this book. yet the whole hadith includes many <br>3 <br>essential and useful subjects and, therefore, its subject- - . P<br>matter is given in the following paragraphs. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anha) says that he in- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallamj about <br>the number of books revealed by Almighty Allah. Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"One hundred <br>booklets and four books. Fifty booklets were revealed to <br>Hadhrat Sheeth (Alaihis salaam) (peace be upon him), <br>thirty to Hadhrat Idrees (Alaihis salaam), ten to Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam) and ten to Hadhrat Musa (Alaihis <br>salaam) before the Torah. In addition. four books, i.e., the <br>Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Holy Qur'an have <br>been revealed by Almighty Allah.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Rad- <br>hi<br>ll h<br>h )<br>i<br>d b<br>h<br>f h b<br>kl<br><br>\"Beware of the sigh of those oppressed, when they <br>Pray 9 <br>Divine acceptance readily greets them. <br>These booklets also mentioned that it is incumbent on <br>a wise man, unless he is deprived of sanity, to divide his <br>time in three parts: one for worship of his Lord; one for <br>self-reckoning to consider what acts, good or bad, he did <br>and one for his lawful earning of livelihood. It is also in- <br>cumbent upon him to watch of his time and be thoughtful <br>about improving his conditions and to guard his tongue <br>against unnecessary and useless talk. Whoever keeps a <br>check on his own speech, his tongue will indulge less in <br>useless talk. <br>Also, a wise man should not travel except for three <br>purposes. viz., for making provision for the life Hereafter, <br>or in search of livelihood, or for such recreation as is per- <br>missible. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) then enquired <br>about the contents of the booklets revealed to Hadhrat <br>Musa (Alaihis salaam) Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal<br><br>Part I (Hadith 22) <br>51 <br>much of laughter, because it causes the heart to wither, and <br>the face loses its lustre.\" (Too much of laughter is injurious <br>both for the outward and inward disposition of man.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) sought further <br>S <br>advice, whereupon Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) -: <br>said, \"Stick to jihaad because this is the rahbaaniyyat of my <br>g 6 <br>ummat.\" (Rahbaan - singular raahib - were those people of <br>3<br>.!> x<br>previous ~ ~ ~ n m a t s  <br>who severed all their worldly connec-<br>tions and turned towards Allah.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked for more <br>advice and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Associate yourself with the poor and the needy, be <br>friendly with them and sit in their company.\" When Hadh- <br>rat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) requested further advice, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Look to-<br>wards those who rank below you (so that you may get used <br>to being thankful) and do not look at those who rank above <br>you, lest you should despise the favours of Allah upon <br>you.\" <br>When Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>k d f<br>d i<br>R<br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>l<br><br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Never do a people collect in one of the houses of <br>I <br>Allah (mosque) reciting the Qur'an and reading it out <br>to one another, but sakeenah (tranquillity) descends <br>1 <br>upon them, rahmat (mercy) enshrouds them, the angels <br>throng around them and Almighty Allah mentions <br>them, in the assembly of angels.\" <br>!<br>This hadith describes the special virtues of religious <br>schools and institutions. Acquisition of either reward men- <br>tioned above is so sublime that even if one devotes his <br>whole life to acquire it, it will be worth while. But here <br>there are so many rewards, especially the last one. Mention <br>in the Court of Almighty Allah and remembrance in the <br>company of the beloved are bounties that can hardly be <br>surpassed. <br>Descending of sakeenah has been mentioned in many <br>ahadith. The scholars of ahadith have interpreted its real <br>significance in many ways. The various interpretations, <br>however, do not contradict each other and can be meaning-<br><br>In Muslim Sharif, this hadith is given in greater detal~. <br>The concluding sentence is- <br>One whose evil deeds drive him away from the mercy <br>of Allah, the superiority of his lineage or nobility of his <br>family cannot bring him near it. <br>Thus a person who has a continuous noble pedigree, <br>but indulges in disobedience and impiety, cannot be equal <br>in the presence of Allah to a Muslim who is of low birth <br>and abject ir, humility, but otherwise God-fearing and <br>devout. <br>;\\ <br>$$;<br>&<br>&\\<br>$&, <br>Verily the noblest of you in the view of Allah is the <br>one who is most God-fearing. <br>21 \t<br>i \t<br>HADITH- 23<br>I<br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 23)<br>55 <br>That the reading of the Qur'an is the best means of get- <br>ting access to Almighty Allah is explained in the commen- <br>tary of Maulana Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi (Nawwarallaho <br>marqadahu), who is an authority for the prosterity. Its sub- <br>stance is that sulook ilallaah (the path of mystics towards <br>Allah) which is also.called the stage of Ihsaan can be at- <br>tained in three ways:- <br>, (1) 'Tasawwur', known as meditation in Sharee'at and <br>muraqabah in the terminology of mystics. <br>(2) Remembrance of \t Allah by repeating words of <br>praise for Him. <br>(3) \t Reading of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Since the first method is remembrance in the heart, so <br>there remain in fact two ways only; first the remembrance <br>by heart or by word of mouth, and secondly recitation of <br>the Qur'an. The essence of zikr is that the word which is <br>used for or refers to Almighty Allah should be repeated <br>over and over again. This repetition helps the mudrakah <br>(the faculty of understanding) in concentrating upon the <br>person of the one being remembered. It would give rise to a<br><br>P ~ r eand Beloved Being (Allah), and it is impossible to <br>seek nearness to anybody else by remembering his name <br>over and over again. This is because the one whose near- <br>ness is being sought must have two attributes. First, he <br>should be omniscient, so that he comprehends the zikr of <br>all the zaakireen, whether by word of mouth or by heart, ir- <br>respective of language, time and place. Secondly, he <br>should have the power to illumine the understanding and <br>fulfil the yearning of one who remembers, which is known <br>as 'dunuww' (nearness), 'tadalli' (proximity), 'nuzul' (de- <br>scent) and 'qurb' (nearness). Since these two prerequisites <br>are possessed only by Allah, the abovementioned method <br>of seeking nearness is effective only in respect of Him. The <br>following hadith-e-qudsi (a revelation of Allah quoted by <br>Rasulullah Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), points to this fact: <br>Whoever comes near Me by one span, I go near him by <br>an arm's length; whoever comes near Me by one arm's <br>length I go near him by one 'baah' (stretch of both<br><br>Part I (Hadith 24) <br>Persian are equal, they produce varying influences upon <br>the readers due to the divergence in the beliefs and atti- <br>tudes of the various authors. It can be concluded that re- <br>peated recitation of the Qur'an will result in the reader's <br>* =<br>being influenced by the qualities of the Originator of the <br>(a<br>verses and in developing a natural affinity for them. More- <br>over, if a person is devoted to the publications of an author, ;d<br>he naturally starts liking and favouring that person. In the f .$<br>&me way, the reader of the Qur'an is sure to win Allah's * X <br>abundant grace, which in turn promotes nearness to Him. <br>May Allah bless us all with His favours. <br>HADITH- 24 <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"For Allah,<br><br>Part I (Hadith 26) <br>possession, even though, this may attract the fullest atten- <br>tion. <br>It is, however, necessary that the Qur'an shall not be <br>recited in a singing tone, because doing so is forbidden <br>according to several ahadith. In one hadith it is said: <br>Beware of reciting the Qur'an in a musical tone, like <br>that of lovers singing their love poems as musical com- <br>positions. <br>The mashaa'ikh say that one who reads the Glorious <br>Qur'an like a musical song is a faasiq (evil-doer), and even <br>a listener to such recitation commits a sin. It is, however, <br>desirable to recite the Qur'an in a sweet voice without fol- <br>lowing the rules of singing. There are various ahadith con- <br>taining exhortation for reading the Qur'an in a sweet voice. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said at one <br>place, \"Adorn the Qur'an with a good voice.\" In another <br>hadith it is said \"A sweet voice makes the beauty of the<br><br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Recite the <br>Qur'an in the Arabic accent, do not recite it in the tone of <br>lowers or in the voice of Jews and Christians. There will <br>shortly arise a people who will recite the Qur'an with affec- <br>tation like singers and mourners, and such reading will be <br>of no advantage to them at all. They themselves will get <br>into trouble, and so also those who admire their reading.\" <br>Taa'oos (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that someone asked <br>Rasulullah (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) \"Who it was who <br>read the, Glorious Qur'an in the best voice?\" Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is he whom you <br>hear and feel that he is under the fear of Allah, i.e., his <br>voice shows his being overwhelmed with fear.\" This is, <br>however, the extreme benevolence of Allah that He does <br>not expect from a person anything beyond his capacity. <br>There is a hadith that Allah has deputed an angel on a <br>special duty. If there be somebody who recites the Qur'an, <br>but is unable to do so as correctly, as it should be done, <br>this angel corrects his recitation before he takes it up to the <br>Heavens \"<br><br>Part I (Hadith 27) \t<br>61 <br>A few points in this hadith are as follows: <br>(1) It is said that the Qur'an should not be used as a <br>pillow. Doing so is an act of disrespect towards the <br>Holy Book. It has been written by Ibn Hajar (Rah- 2 5 <br>matullah alaih) that using the Qur'an as a pillow, <br>C <br>a --2<br>stretching one's feet towards it, and trampling over <br>it, are acts which are all forbidden. Secondly, the <br>9 g <br>r q<br>expression \"using as a pillow\" also implies show- g x <br>ing neglect towards the Holy Qur'an. It serves no <br>purpose to place it on a pillow, as it is sometimes <br>found placed on a stand by the side of a grave in a <br>shrine for barakah (blessings). This is utter dis- <br>regard of the Holy Book. We owe it to the Holy <br>Book that it should be read. <br>(2) \t The expression \"Read it as it ought to be read\" <br>means that it should be read with the highest <br>degree of reverence. Commandment to this effect <br>is there in the Qur'an itself.<br><br>I am afraid, 0, Bedouin! you can never reach Ka'bah. <br>Because the path you are following leads to Turkistan. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has ordered <br>spreading of the Qur'an, but we do not hesitate to put all <br>sorts of hurdles in the way of its propagation. We make <br>laws for compulsory secular education so that children, <br>instead of learning the Qur'an, are forced to join primary <br>schools. We are displeased with teachers in religious <br>schools for spoiling the lives of children, and, therefore, we <br>do not send our children to them. Even if this apprehen- <br>sion is correct, it does not absolve us of our responsibility. <br>On the other hand, our responsibility becomes even greater <br>because we are all duty-bound, individually and collecti- <br>vely, to propagate the Qur'an. The religious teacher is, no <br>doubt, responsible for his shortcomings, but if, because of <br>his defects, we prevent children from going to religious <br>schools, get notices issued to their parents in the name of <br>compulsory primary education, compelling them to de-<br>prive their children of learning the Qur'an, then this is like <br>killing a tuberculosis patient by giving him poison. An at- <br>tempt to justify our hostile conduct by the supposed omis-<br><br>Part I (Hadith 28) <br>some of your friends sit with you and talk to you; <br>you pay them full attention. You listen to them <br>and try to understand them. If anybody tries to in- <br>terrupt you, you stop him with a gesture. I talk to <br>you through My Book, but you pay no heed. Do <br>you consider Me inferior to your friends?\" The <br>merits of meditation and contemplation on the <br>contents of the Qur'an have already been men-<br>tioned in the Foreword of this book and again <br>under hadith 8. <br>The expression \"do not seek prompt reward\" means <br>that no wages should be accepted for reciting the Qur'an, <br>because your recitation is going to fetch you a great reward <br>in the Hereafter. <br>To accept reward for it in this life is just like being <br>content with shells instead of money. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When my Ummat will attach <br>more value to money, it will lose the dignity which Islam <br>confers on it, and when it will give up enjoining good and <br>forbidding evil, it will be deprived of the blessings of <br>Divine Revelation viz the understanding of the Qur'an \"<br><br>lowing twenty surahs are known as 'al-Mathaani' (the oft- <br>repeated ones), while all the remaining surahs are called <br>'al-Mufassal' (the explicit ones). This division is according <br>to a popular interpretation, but there is some difference of <br>opinion as to whether a certain surah is included in 'as- <br>Sab'ut Tuwal' or 'al-Mi'een'. Similarly there is a dis-<br>agreement as to whether a surah falls under 'al-Mathaani' <br>or 'al-Mufassal'. But this disagreement does not affect the <br>meaning or purpose of this hadith. This hadith shows that <br>the Holy Qur'aan contains the equivalents of all the import- <br>ant Heavenly Books that had been revealed earlier, and <br>moreover contains 'al-Mufassal' as a special addition, the <br>like of which is not to be found in the earlier books.<br><br>Part I (Hadith 29) <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"All <br>praise is for Allah, Who created such people in my <br>Ummat that I have been ordered to stay with them.' Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sat in our midst <br>so as to be equidistant from all of us. Then he asked all 4'\" <br>of us to get closer to him. All of us sat with our faces <br>towards him. Thereafter, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>d <br>wasallam) said, '0, you poor muhajireen, I give you <br>-5 +<br>glad tidings of perfect noor on the Day of Judgement, * X <br>and you shall enter Paradise before wealthy people by <br>half a day, and this half day will be equal to five hun- <br>dred years. \" <br>That muhajireen did not even have sufficient clothes <br>to cover their whole body apparently refers to the exposure <br>of that part of the body which it is not obligatory to cover. <br>But in public one feels shy at the exposure of even such <br>parts. This is the reason why they were sitting behind one <br>another. <br>They did not become aware of the arrival of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as he came, because of their <br>pre-occupation<br>They saw him when he had come very<br><br>For true believers, this day will be shorter according to <br>their status. It is reported that, for some true believers, it <br>will be like the time spent in two rakaat of Fajr salaat. <br>The merits of reading the Qur'an are given in many <br>ahadith. Similarly, the merits of listening to the Qur'an are <br>also found in numerous ahadith. The act of listening to the <br>recitation of the Qur'an is so virtuous that Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had been ordered to stay among <br>those engaged in reading the Qur'an, as given in this <br>hadith. Some learned scholars are of the opinion that lis- <br>tening to the Qur'an is more virtuous than reading it, be- <br>cause reading the Qur'an is nafl and listening fard, and fard <br>act is always better than a nafl one. <br>From this hadith there is one more deduction, in re- <br>spect of which the learned scholars differ in their opinion. <br>There is disagreement as to whether a destitute but stead- <br>fast person, who conceals his poverty from others is better, <br>or a wealthy person who is grateful to Allah and discharges <br>his obligations. This hadith provides an argument in favour <br>of the destitute one who is steadfast.<br><br>Part I (Hadith 31) <br>67 <br>virtuous than its reading. Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while sitting on the mimbar (pulpit), said to him, \"Recite <br>the Qur'an for me.\" Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, <br>\"It does not behove me to read out the Qur'an to you, be- <br>cause it is you to whom it was revealed.\" Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"It is mv heart's desire to <br>listen.\" Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) adds that when <br>he recited the Qur'an, tears started flowing from the eyes of <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Once Saalim (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the freed slave of Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was reciting the Glorious Qur'an and Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stood by, listening to him for a <br>long time. Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>listened to recitation of the Glorious Qur'an by Abu Musa <br>Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) and admired his reading. <br>HADITH- 31<br><br>Many people have argued on the basis of this hadith <br>that reading in a low voice is more virtuous. Imam Baihaqi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) in his book, 'Kitabush Shu'ab', has <br>written that Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) had re- <br>ported that the reward of doing a good act secretly is se- <br>venty times more than that of doing it openly. But, <br>according to the rules laid down by the muhadditheen <br>I <br>(scholars of ahadith), this hadith is dha'eef (weak). <br>I <br>Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Do not read in a <br>loud voice, lest the voice of one should get mixed up with <br>the other.\" Hadhrat Umar ibn Abdul Aziz (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) found a person reading the Qur'an in a loud voice in <br>Musjid-i-Nabawi and had stopped him. The reader, how- <br>ever, tried to argue, whereupon Hadhrat 'Umar ibn Abdul <br>Aziz (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If you read for the sake of <br>Allah, read in a low voice and, if you read for the sake of <br>men, then such reading is of no use.\" <br>Similarly an advice of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), for reading the Qur'an in a loud voice, has also <br>been reported<br>2<br><br>22 \t<br>'ta'aam' and 'sharaab' i.e. food and drink, as translated <br>above, but in the book of Haakim we find the word 'shaha- <br>waat' (passions) in place of 'sharaab', i.e. fasting prevented <br>a person from eating and indulging in his passions. It is im- <br>plied here that one should abstain even from such acts of <br>physical pleasure which are permissible e.g. kissing and <br>embracing (one's own wife). It is given in some ahadith <br>that the Holy Qur'an will appear in the semblance of a <br>youth and will say, \"It is I who kept you awake during the <br>night and thirsty during the day.\" <br>This hadith implies that a hafiz should recite the <br>Qur'an in nafl salaat at night, as explained already in detail <br>under hadith 27. In the Holy Qur'an itself at various places <br>there are encouragements to this effect. Some verses are <br>given below: <br>(1) And keep awake some part of the night for reciting <br>it in Tahajjud salaat.<br><br>Part I (Hadith 33) <br>71 <br>the whole Qur'an in two rakaats inside the Ka'bah. Thabit <br>Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) used to read out the whole <br>Qur'an in one day and night, and so was also the case with <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho). Abu Shaikh Hannaa'i <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"I read the whole Qur'an twice, <br>and ten parts in addition, in a single night. If I wanted, I y<br>could have completed the third reading as well.\" In the eg<br>course of his journey for the Haj pilgrimage, Salih ibn <br>KaGaan (Radhiyallaho anho) often used to complete two 5x <br>readings of the Qur'an each night. Mansoor ibn Zaazaan <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) completed one reading during nafl <br>salaat before noon, and the second reading in the interval <br>between Zuhr (afternoon) and Asr (late afternoon) salaat, <br>and he spent the whole night in offering nafl salat, weeping <br>so much that the end of his turban would become wet. <br>Similar had been the case with many others, as described <br>by Muhammad ibn Nasr (Rahmatullah alaih) in his book <br>'Qiyaamul Lail' <br>It is written in 'Sharhul Ihya' that our ancestors in <br>deen differed from one another in their practices of com- <br>pleting the reading of the whole Qur'an. Some of them <br>l<br>d<br>di<br>f h<br>h l<br>Q<br>'<br>d<br><br>the month of Ramadhan-once everyday, once everynight, <br>and one reading was completed in Taraweeh salaat. <br>On the other hand, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said that one who completes one reading of the <br>Qur'an in less than three days cannot meditate upon it. For <br>this reason, Ibn Hazm (Rahmatullah alaih) and some others <br>are of the opinion that reading the whole Qur'an in less <br>than three days is forbidden. According to the authar, this <br>hadith refers to the capacity of the readers in general, <br>otherwise completion of one reading of the Holy Qur'an <br>in less than three days by a group of Sahabah has been <br>reported. Similarly, according to the opinion of the Jamhur <br>(general body of 'ulama), there is no limitation on the maxi- <br>mum period in which one reading should be completed. <br>The reading should be completed within such time as is <br>convenient. But some 'ulama say that the maximum period <br>should not exceed forty days. This means that at least <br>three-fourth of a part should be read daily and if, for any <br>reason, this much of reading-is not done on any day, the <br>missed portion should also be covered on the next day, so <br>that the whole reading is completed within forty days<br><br>Part I (Hadith 34) \t<br>73 <br>the night. Some mashaa'ikh have, therefore, concluded that <br>the reading of the whole Qur'an should be completed pref- <br>erably in the early part of the day during the summer <br>season and in the early part of the night during winter, so <br>that the reader is benefited for a longer period by the pray- 4 3<br>ers of the angels. <br>\"i <br>a& <br>HADITH- 34 <br>*,k<br>531 <br>' e r .  \t \" \" <br>. r  <br>9.. <br>* <br>&L& Al JrJ JU J U S ,  u <br>.-. <br>(Yf)<br>Al &j & 2 1Srj <br>#. \t<br>I .  <br>r<br>62y; uy;$9 qiy\\ G\\~2 <br>a2 &i+ <br>(p.l&YI <br>j j IS.+-+ <br>j!,JEJI<br>J' Ul-+ obJ <br>JG) <br>Hadhrat Sa'eed bin Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>reported that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"On the Day of Judgement, before Allah, no other <br>intercessor will have a greater status than the Qur'an, <br>neither a Prophet nor an angel, etc.\" <br>It has been learnt from several other ahadith that the<br><br>from al-Mala'ul A'laa (the angels in Heaven) a silk bedding <br>filled with musk.

Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>5 <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the<br><br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak the famous Soofi writes<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>31 <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\",<br>said Hadhrat<br><br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\"<br><br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us!<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>35 <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar<br><br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\"<br><br>"

Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of<br><br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favourson<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>41 <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day.

The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in<br><br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported<br><br>I <br>I<br>1 <br>I <br>1 <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand-<br><br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The<br><br>i<br>I <br>, <br>l <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the<br><br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and<br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>47 <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>3 <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0<br><br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>2 <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>52<br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer-<br><br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\"<br><br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the<br><br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>55<br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion Hadhrat Abu<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>4<br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises.

A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>59 <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>5<br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>l i<br>h<br>i<br>f<br>l<br>i h<br>b<br>h i<br><br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>h<br>t<br>d<br>l t<br>d t<br>Hi<br>l<br>h<br>th<br>d<br>f l<br><br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\"<br><br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of-<br><br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\"<br><br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those<br><br>"

Paradise is for my own pleasure <br>while salaat is for the pleasure of my dear Lord.\" The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: \"Enviable is <br>the lot of that Muslim who is with least encumbrance, <br>whose main fortune is salaat, who remains content with <br>humble provision throughout his life, who worshi s his <br>Lord in a dutiful manner, who lives a nameless li e and <br>P<br>who dies an early death, with very little to bequeath and <br>very few to mourn him.\" In another hadith, the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said: 'Offer your salaat at your homes quite frequently, so <br>that these may be blessed with Allah's Grace and Mercy.\"<br><br>- - <br>I <br>CONTENTS <br>7 <br>Page No.<br>Story <br>IX A surgical operation during<br>Salaat . . .. . .... . .... . .. . . . .. <br>81<br>I <br>Story <br>X Abu Amir's story about a slave <br>woman ..... . .... . .. . ..... . . <br>81<br>Story <br>XI Story of Umar bin Abdul Aziz ... <br>82 <br>Story <br>XI1 Muhammad <br>bin <br>Munkadir's<br>Salaat .. . . . ... . .. . . . . ... . ... <br>83 <br>Story <br>XI11 Thabit Banani's Salaat ... . . . . . . <br>83<br>Pursuits of a few pious Persons .. <br>84 <br>CHAPTER 111.--QUOTATIONS FROM AHAADITH <br>Hadith <br>I Reward proportional to Sincer- <br>ity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  <br>86 <br>Hadith <br>I1 Reward of good Salaat . . . . . . . . . . <br>86 <br>Hadith <br>I11<br>Benefitof Nafl Salaat . .. . . .. ... .<br>88<br><br>'Kindness to parents'. I again asked what was next and he <br>answered 'Jihaad'.\" <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted this <br>Hadith in support of the belief that salaat is the most inl- <br>portant religious duty after Imaan. This is further corrobo- <br>rated by a hadith, in which the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the best of all that has been ordained by <br>Allah.\"<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Abu Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"I was <br>once sitting under a tree with Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyal- <br>!ah0 anho). He caught hold of a dry branch of the tree and <br>shook it till all its leaves fell off. He then said to me, \"0,<br><br>wasallam). They would often cherish the sweet memories <br>of the time when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was living among them. They would, while quoting him, <br>enact exactly what they had seen him doing at a particular <br>moment. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the traditions of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which deal <br>with the importance of salaat and which declare forgive- <br>ness for those who guard it. As had already been said <br>before, the theologians restrict this declaration of forgive- <br>ness to saghaa'ir (minor sins) only, but in the text of the <br>hadith there is no such restriction. My learned father gave <br>me two reasons for this. Firstly, it does not really become a <br>Muslim to commit any of the kabaa'ir (major sins). If per- <br>chance any such sins are committed by him, he cannot rest <br>in peace (due to inherent fear of Allah in him) until he <br>washes them with his tears of repentance in crying before <br>Allah. Secondly, the person who performs his salaat with <br>sincerity and thoroughness is very likely to do istighfaar <br>quite a number of times daily. Look for instance at the clos- <br>ing prayer of salaat itself, viz:<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Saiaat <br>\"Allah and his angels love the person doing miswaak.\" <br>\"It strengthens the gums and improves eye-sight.\" <br>\"It is a purge against bile and phlegm.\" <br>To crown all, \"It is a sunnah i.e. the practice of our be- <br>loved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>As many as seventy virtues of the n~iswaak have been <br>enumerated by the theologians. It is said that a person in <br>the habit of miswaak dies with the Kalimah on his lips. <br>The rewards of taking wudhu properly are very many. It is <br>mentioned in ahaadith that the parts of body washed in <br>wudhu shall glitter on the Day of Judgement and, by this <br>(distinction), the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will <br>at once recognise his followers. <br>Hadith.-IV(a)<br><br>rode his camel reciting the following verse of the Holy <br>Qur'an: <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat, and truly <br>it is indeed hard except to the humble minded.\" <br>(11:45). <br>There is yet another story about him. On hearing of the <br>death of a wife of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), he fell down prostrate. When somebody asked him <br>the reason he said, \"Our dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had enjoined on us to prostrate (in salaat) when- <br>ever a calamity were to befall us. What calamity can be <br>greater than the death of the Ummul-Mo'mineen?\" <br>When Hadhrat Ubaada (Radhiyallaho anho) was about <br>to breathe his last, he said to the people around him, \"I <br>prohibit one and all from crying over me. When my soul <br>departs, I ask every one to perform wudhu, observing all its <br>essentials, and to go to the musjid and pray for my forgive-<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be thyself <br>constant therein. We ask not of thee to provide suste- <br>nance. We provide it for thee. And the Hereafter is for <br>the righteousness.\" <br>(XX: 132). <br>It is said in a hadith that when somebody is confronted <br>with a need, whether pertaining to this life or the Hereafter, <br>or whether it concerns Allah or a mortal, he should per- <br>form a perfect wudhu, offer salaat of two rakaats, glorify <br>Allah, then ask blessing for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and then pray as under: <br>0,<br>k\", m <br>\"There is no god save Allah-the Clement-the Bouqti-<br>ful. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the tremendous <br>th<br>P<br>i<br>b t<br>All h th L<br>d f th<br>ld<br>I<br>k<br><br>26<br>other road which is a shortcut and there is plenty of grass <br>enroute to feed the animal.' The porter said, 'I have never <br>been on this path.' The person remarked, 'But I have travel- <br>led by this route quite often'. The porter believed him and <br>put the animal on that path. After some distance, the path <br>ended in a terrifying forest where a large number of dead <br>bodies were lying about. All of a sudden the person <br>jumped down from the mule and took out his knife with <br>the intention of slaying the porter. 'Hold your hand', <br>shouted the porter, 'Take the animal and its load, but do <br>not kill me'. The person refused to listen to his entreaty <br>and swore that he would first kill the porter and then take <br>possession of the animal and the goads. Seeing that his en- <br>treaties fell on deaf ears and that his cruel heart would not <br>melt, the porter said to him, 'All right if you must kill me, <br>then permit to say my salaat of only two rakaats.' The <br>person agreed and remarked, 'You can please yourself. All <br>the dead you see over here made the same request, but <br>their salaat was of no avail to them.' The porter started the <br>salaat, but could not recollect any soorah to connect with <br>the Fatihah, in spite of his best efforts. Meanwhile the <br>person grew impatient and pressed him hard to hurry up<br><br>Imam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) that he could tell <br>from the water falling down from the limbs of the person <br>performing wudhu as to which sins had been washed off <br>therewith. In a narration by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have warned against being wrong-headed in com- <br>mitting sins in the hope of getting them redeemed through <br>salaat. We have, really, no ground to behave as such on <br>this account. After all, what is the quality of the salaat that <br>we offer? If Allah merely absolves us of our obligation it is <br>His very special favour and grace. Again it is the height of <br>ingratitude to disobey Allah just because He is Clement, <br>Merciful and Forgiving.<br><br>Hadbrat Abu Qataadah bin Rab'iyy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"He heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, Allah has said, \"0, Muhammad! I <br>have ordained five times daily salaat for thy followers. <br>I have made a covenant with myself that whosoever is <br>regular in performing his salaat at its fixed hour, he <br>shall be admitted into the Paradise. Those of thy fol- <br>lowers who do not guard their salaat, are not included <br>in this covenant.\" <br>In another hadith, it is said that Allah has ordained <br>five times salaat and whosoever is mindful of his salaat, by <br>doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with <br>sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah of his entry into <br>Paradise; and whosoever does not guard his salaat, there is <br>h<br>f<br>hi<br>h<br>b f<br>i<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>25<br>Ibn Salmaan says that he heard one of the companions <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) nar- <br>rating, \"When we had won the battle of Khaibar, we <br>began to buy and sell among ourselves the booty that <br>had fallen to our lot. One of us went to Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, '0, Apostle of <br>Allah, no one else has earned so much profit as I have <br>obtained in today's trade.' 'How much did you earn? <br>asked the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He re- <br>plied, 'I kept on selling and buying till I earned a net <br>profit of three hundred 'Ooqiyyah' of silver.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I <br>inform you of something better than that?\" He ex-<br>claimed, 'Do tell me, 0,Prophet of Allah!' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked 'Two rakaats <br>nafl after (fardh) salaat.\" <br>Three hundred Ooqiyyahsof silver come to about three<br><br>perform their Fajr with Jamaat and keep sitting after prayer <br>till a little while after sunrise and then offer two rakaats of <br>salaat.\" According to Shaqeeq Balkhi, a very famous <br>Shaikh, five things could be acquired through five chan- <br>nels; an increase in provisions through 'Chaasht' a light in <br>the grave through Tahajjud, a very satisfactory answer to <br>Munkar and Nakeer through the recitation of the Qur'an; an <br>easy crossing of Siraat through fasting and alms, and room <br>under the shade of Allah's Throne on the Day of Judgement <br>through seclusion (i.e. Zikr). <br>There are so many sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) enjoining salaat and explaining its <br>virtues that it is very difficult to cover all of them in this <br>small book. A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in <br>the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in the matter of<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>27 <br>people frequenting the musjid are spared and <br>saved.\" <br>12. \t \"If some major sins of a Muslim land him in Hell, <br>the fire would not burn those parts of his body <br>which have touched the ground while he was in <br>sajdah during his salaat.\" <br>13. \t \"Fire has been forbidden to touch those parts of <br>the body which touch the ground while perform- <br>ing the sajdah.\" <br>% <br>4 <br>14. \"Of all the practices, salaat made at fixed hours is 8 <br>0 <br>5<br>most loved by Allah.\" \t<br>.-<br>L V ~<br>> <br>15. \"Allah likes most the posture of a person when he <br>is in sajdah, pressing his forehead on the ground <br>in humility.\" <br>16. \"A person in sajdah is nearest unto Allah.\" <br>17. \"Sa1aa.t is a key to Paradise.\" <br>18. \"When a person stands in salaat the gates of Par- <br>adise are let open and all the veils between him <br>and Allah are lifted (provided that he spoils not<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>29 <br>doubt the dignity of a Mo'min is in Tahajjud and <br>his honour is in contentment and restraint.\" <br>38. \t \"Two rakaats in the late hours of the night are more <br>valuable than all the riches of this world. But for <br>fear of hardship to my followers, I would have <br>made these obligatory.\" <br>39. \t \"Keep offering Tahajjud, for it is the path of the <br>righteous and the means of approach to Allah. Ta- <br>hajjud keeps one away from sins, causes forgive- <br>ness of sins and improves the health of the body.\" <br>(r0 % <br>3 B <br>40. \t \"Allah says, '0,son of Aadam! Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>5 <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the<br><br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak the famous Soofi writes<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>31 <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\",<br>said Hadhrat<br><br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\"<br><br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us!<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>35 <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar<br><br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\"<br><br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>37 <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>8<br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>th<br>l<br>ti<br>l M<br>li<br>f<br>b<br>f th i<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of<br><br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favourson<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>41 <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in<br><br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported<br><br>I <br>I<br>1 <br>I <br>1 <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque.

When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right.

In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures.

'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the<br><br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and<br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>47 <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>3 <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0<br><br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>2 <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>52<br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer-<br><br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\"<br><br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the<br><br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>55<br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion Hadhrat Abu<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>4<br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not<br><br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>59 <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>5<br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>l i<br>h<br>i<br>f<br>l<br>i h<br>b<br>h i<br><br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>h<br>t<br>d<br>l t<br>d t<br>Hi<br>l<br>h<br>th<br>d<br>f l<br><br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\"<br><br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of-<br><br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\"<br><br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those<br><br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice.

They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>29<br><br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after.

Salaat is <br>indeed a great boon. That is why Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of my eyes', and <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) prayed to Allah, <br>\"My Lord! make me to establish Salaat, and some of <br>my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept the prayer.\" <br>(XIV:40) <br>Here the eminent Prophet of Allah, whom Allah has <br>called 'Khaleel', is asking Allah to make him say his salaat <br>properly and regularly. The Glorious Allah Himself is or- <br>dering His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>thus:-<br><br>and also the devotion and submission obligatory therein. <br>The practical example of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), as also the practices of his illustrious <br>companions, should be the guiding factor in our lives. I <br>have collected the stories about the salaat of the compan- <br>ions in a separate book, named \"Stories of Sahabah,\" and I <br>need not repeat them here. However, I am giving stories <br>from the lives of a few pious persons in the following <br>pages.

This is further corrobo- <br>rated by a hadith, in which the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the best of all that has been ordained by <br>Allah.\"<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Abu Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"I was <br>once sitting under a tree with Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyal- <br>!ah0 anho). He caught hold of a dry branch of the tree and <br>shook it till all its leaves fell off. He then said to me, \"0,<br><br>wasallam). They would often cherish the sweet memories <br>of the time when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was living among them. They would, while quoting him, <br>enact exactly what they had seen him doing at a particular <br>moment. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the traditions of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which deal <br>with the importance of salaat and which declare forgive- <br>ness for those who guard it. As had already been said <br>before, the theologians restrict this declaration of forgive- <br>ness to saghaa'ir (minor sins) only, but in the text of the <br>hadith there is no such restriction. My learned father gave <br>me two reasons for this. Firstly, it does not really become a <br>Muslim to commit any of the kabaa'ir (major sins). If per- <br>chance any such sins are committed by him, he cannot rest <br>in peace (due to inherent fear of Allah in him) until he <br>washes them with his tears of repentance in crying before <br>Allah. Secondly, the person who performs his salaat with <br>sincerity and thoroughness is very likely to do istighfaar <br>quite a number of times daily. Look for instance at the clos- <br>ing prayer of salaat itself, viz:<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Saiaat <br>\"Allah and his angels love the person doing miswaak.\" <br>\"It strengthens the gums and improves eye-sight.\" <br>\"It is a purge against bile and phlegm.\" <br>To crown all, \"It is a sunnah i.e. the practice of our be- <br>loved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>As many as seventy virtues of the n~iswaak have been <br>enumerated by the theologians. It is said that a person in <br>the habit of miswaak dies with the Kalimah on his lips. <br>The rewards of taking wudhu properly are very many. It is <br>mentioned in ahaadith that the parts of body washed in <br>wudhu shall glitter on the Day of Judgement and, by this <br>(distinction), the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will <br>at once recognise his followers. <br>Hadith.-IV(a)<br><br>rode his camel reciting the following verse of the Holy <br>Qur'an: <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat, and truly <br>it is indeed hard except to the humble minded.\" <br>(11:45). <br>There is yet another story about him. On hearing of the <br>death of a wife of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), he fell down prostrate. When somebody asked him <br>the reason he said, \"Our dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had enjoined on us to prostrate (in salaat) when- <br>ever a calamity were to befall us. What calamity can be <br>greater than the death of the Ummul-Mo'mineen?\" <br>When Hadhrat Ubaada (Radhiyallaho anho) was about <br>to breathe his last, he said to the people around him, \"I <br>prohibit one and all from crying over me. When my soul <br>departs, I ask every one to perform wudhu, observing all its <br>essentials, and to go to the musjid and pray for my forgive-<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be thyself <br>constant therein. We ask not of thee to provide suste- <br>nance. We provide it for thee. And the Hereafter is for <br>the righteousness.\" <br>(XX: 132). <br>It is said in a hadith that when somebody is confronted <br>with a need, whether pertaining to this life or the Hereafter, <br>or whether it concerns Allah or a mortal, he should per- <br>form a perfect wudhu, offer salaat of two rakaats, glorify <br>Allah, then ask blessing for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and then pray as under: <br>0,<br>k\", m <br>\"There is no god save Allah-the Clement-the Bouqti-<br>ful.

The porter said, 'I have never <br>been on this path.' The person remarked, 'But I have travel- <br>led by this route quite often'. The porter believed him and <br>put the animal on that path. After some distance, the path <br>ended in a terrifying forest where a large number of dead <br>bodies were lying about. All of a sudden the person <br>jumped down from the mule and took out his knife with <br>the intention of slaying the porter. 'Hold your hand', <br>shouted the porter, 'Take the animal and its load, but do <br>not kill me'. The person refused to listen to his entreaty <br>and swore that he would first kill the porter and then take <br>possession of the animal and the goads. Seeing that his en- <br>treaties fell on deaf ears and that his cruel heart would not <br>melt, the porter said to him, 'All right if you must kill me, <br>then permit to say my salaat of only two rakaats.' The <br>person agreed and remarked, 'You can please yourself. All <br>the dead you see over here made the same request, but <br>their salaat was of no avail to them.' The porter started the <br>salaat, but could not recollect any soorah to connect with <br>the Fatihah, in spite of his best efforts. Meanwhile the <br>person grew impatient and pressed him hard to hurry up<br><br>Imam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) that he could tell <br>from the water falling down from the limbs of the person <br>performing wudhu as to which sins had been washed off <br>therewith. In a narration by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have warned against being wrong-headed in com- <br>mitting sins in the hope of getting them redeemed through <br>salaat. We have, really, no ground to behave as such on <br>this account. After all, what is the quality of the salaat that <br>we offer? If Allah merely absolves us of our obligation it is <br>His very special favour and grace. Again it is the height of <br>ingratitude to disobey Allah just because He is Clement, <br>Merciful and Forgiving.<br><br>Hadbrat Abu Qataadah bin Rab'iyy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"He heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, Allah has said, \"0, Muhammad! I <br>have ordained five times daily salaat for thy followers. <br>I have made a covenant with myself that whosoever is <br>regular in performing his salaat at its fixed hour, he <br>shall be admitted into the Paradise. Those of thy fol- <br>lowers who do not guard their salaat, are not included <br>in this covenant.\" <br>In another hadith, it is said that Allah has ordained <br>five times salaat and whosoever is mindful of his salaat, by <br>doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with <br>sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah of his entry into <br>Paradise; and whosoever does not guard his salaat, there is <br>h<br>f<br>hi<br>h<br>b f<br>i<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>25<br>Ibn Salmaan says that he heard one of the companions <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) nar- <br>rating, \"When we had won the battle of Khaibar, we <br>began to buy and sell among ourselves the booty that <br>had fallen to our lot. One of us went to Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, '0, Apostle of <br>Allah, no one else has earned so much profit as I have <br>obtained in today's trade.' 'How much did you earn? <br>asked the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He re- <br>plied, 'I kept on selling and buying till I earned a net <br>profit of three hundred 'Ooqiyyah' of silver.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I <br>inform you of something better than that?\" He ex-<br>claimed, 'Do tell me, 0,Prophet of Allah!' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked 'Two rakaats <br>nafl after (fardh) salaat.\" <br>Three hundred Ooqiyyahsof silver come to about three<br><br>perform their Fajr with Jamaat and keep sitting after prayer <br>till a little while after sunrise and then offer two rakaats of <br>salaat.\" According to Shaqeeq Balkhi, a very famous <br>Shaikh, five things could be acquired through five chan- <br>nels; an increase in provisions through 'Chaasht' a light in <br>the grave through Tahajjud, a very satisfactory answer to <br>Munkar and Nakeer through the recitation of the Qur'an; an <br>easy crossing of Siraat through fasting and alms, and room <br>under the shade of Allah's Throne on the Day of Judgement <br>through seclusion (i.e. Zikr). <br>There are so many sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) enjoining salaat and explaining its <br>virtues that it is very difficult to cover all of them in this <br>small book. A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in <br>the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in the matter of<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>27 <br>people frequenting the musjid are spared and <br>saved.\" <br>12. \t \"If some major sins of a Muslim land him in Hell, <br>the fire would not burn those parts of his body <br>which have touched the ground while he was in <br>sajdah during his salaat.\" <br>13. \t \"Fire has been forbidden to touch those parts of <br>the body which touch the ground while perform- <br>ing the sajdah.\" <br>% <br>4 <br>14. \"Of all the practices, salaat made at fixed hours is 8 <br>0 <br>5<br>most loved by Allah.\" \t<br>.-<br>L V ~<br>> <br>15. \"Allah likes most the posture of a person when he <br>is in sajdah, pressing his forehead on the ground <br>in humility.\" <br>16. \"A person in sajdah is nearest unto Allah.\" <br>17. \"Sa1aa.t is a key to Paradise.\" <br>18. \"When a person stands in salaat the gates of Par- <br>adise are let open and all the veils between him <br>and Allah are lifted (provided that he spoils not<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>29 <br>doubt the dignity of a Mo'min is in Tahajjud and <br>his honour is in contentment and restraint.\" <br>38. \t \"Two rakaats in the late hours of the night are more <br>valuable than all the riches of this world. But for <br>fear of hardship to my followers, I would have <br>made these obligatory.\" <br>39. \t \"Keep offering Tahajjud, for it is the path of the <br>righteous and the means of approach to Allah.

Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>5 <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the<br><br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak the famous Soofi writes<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>31 <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\",<br>said Hadhrat<br><br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\"<br><br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us!<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>35 <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar<br><br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\"<br><br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>37 <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>8<br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>th<br>l<br>ti<br>l M<br>li<br>f<br>b<br>f th i<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of<br><br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favourson<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>41 <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in<br><br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported<br><br>I <br>I<br>1 <br>I <br>1 <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand-<br><br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The<br><br>i<br>I <br>, <br>l <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the<br><br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and<br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>47 <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>3 <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0<br><br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX<br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>2 <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>52<br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer-<br><br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\"<br><br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the<br><br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>55<br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion Hadhrat Abu<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>4<br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not<br><br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>59 <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>5<br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>l i<br>h<br>i<br>f<br>l<br>i h<br>b<br>h i<br><br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>h<br>t<br>d<br>l t<br>d t<br>Hi<br>l<br>h<br>th<br>d<br>f l<br><br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\"<br><br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of-<br><br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\"<br><br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those<br><br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice. He replied, 'Be sincere in all your <br>services, as sincerity will magnify the value of an action, <br>however insignificant it may be.\" <br>Hadhrat Thaubaan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Blessed be the sincere ones, for they are the lamps of <br>guidance. They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>29<br><br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after.

The persons who had ruined <br>their salaat shall be thrown into this pit. <br>Quotation- V<br>I <br>\"And naught preventeth that their (the hypocrites) <br>contributions should be accepted from them, save that <br>they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Apostle, and <br>they come not to worship, save as idlers, and pay3 not <br>i <br>(their contribution) save reluctantly.\" <br>(IV:54) <br>Note: The quotations I to V above relate to those who ruin <br>salaat. On the other hand, the following speak of <br>those whom Allah praises for their good salaat. <br>I<br><br>from all its rivers originate. Allah's throne will be placed <br>there. When you pray for Paradise, always pray for Fir- <br>daus.\" <br>\"And truly it (salaat) is hard save for the humble- <br>minded; who know that they have to meet their Lord, <br>and that unto Him they are returning.\" <br>(11: 45-46) <br>Quotation- VIII<br><br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>71 <br>I <br>I <br>\"The (faithful) slaves of Rahmaan (the Beneficent) are <br>they who walk upon the earth modestly and when the <br>foolish ever address them, they answer: Peace; and <br>who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and <br>standing.\" <br>(XXV: 63 -64) <br>After describing a few more qualities of His faithful <br>slaves, Allah says in the same context: <br>3 <br>2 <br>5 <br>\"They will be awarded the high place for as much as <br>they were steadfast, and they will meet therein with <br>welcome and the word of peace. Abiding there for <br>ever Happy is it asabode and station \"<br>(XXV:75 76)<br><br>Part 111 [a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>\"And those who guard their salaat. These will dwell in <br>gardens, honoured.\" <br>(LXX:34-35). <br>Besides the quotations given above, there are many <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an enjoining salaat and exalting and <br>extolling those who say their salaat properly. Salaat is <br>indeed a great boon. That is why Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of my eyes', and <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) prayed to Allah, <br>\"My Lord! make me to establish Salaat, and some of <br>my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept the prayer.\" <br>(XIV:40) <br>Here the eminent Prophet of Allah, whom Allah has <br>called 'Khaleel', is asking Allah to make him say his salaat <br>properly and regularly. The Glorious Allah Himself is or- <br>dering His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>thus:-<br><br>and also the devotion and submission obligatory therein. <br>The practical example of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), as also the practices of his illustrious <br>companions, should be the guiding factor in our lives. I <br>have collected the stories about the salaat of the compan- <br>ions in a separate book, named \"Stories of Sahabah,\" and I <br>need not repeat them here. However, I am giving stories <br>from the lives of a few pious persons in the following <br>pages. The practices and the sayings of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) about this subject would <br>appear in Chapter 111.<br><br>who they were. She replied that they were my previous <br>nights and that the ugly one was this night.\" <br>An eminent Shaikh says: \"One night I was in a deep <br>sleep and could not get up for Tahajjud. I saw in my dream <br>a girl of such beauty as I had never seen in my life. She was <br>emitting such fragrance as I had never smelt before. She <br>handed over to me a piece of paper on which were written <br>three couplets, which meant, 'You were so enamoured of <br>deep sleep that you have become unmindful of the high <br>balconies of Paradise, where you have to abide for ever <br>with no fear of death. Wake up! It is better to recite the <br>Qur'an in Tahajjud than to sleep.\" since then, wherever I <br>feel sleepy, these couplets come to my mind and the sleep <br>goes away.\" <br>Ataa (Rahmatullah alaih) writes, \"I went to the market. <br>A person had a slave girl to sell, who was said to be mad; I <br>purchased her for seven dinaars and brought her to my <br>house After a portion of the night had passed I noticed<br><br>"

When the king was informed about it, he was <br>surprised to learn how an ordinary person had the <br>courage to do all that and also wondered why he left <br>one cask intact. The man was called for, and interro- <br>gated. He replied, \"My conscience had urged me to do <br>this; you may punish me as you like.\" He was then <br>asked why one cask was left unbroken? He replied, \"At <br>first I broke the casks of wine out of my religous senti- <br>ments, but when only one was left, my heart felt elated <br>at having done something forbidden by religion. I then <br>felt that breaking this last cask would be for the satis- <br>faction of my ego. I, therefore, did not break it.\" Find- <br>ing him selfless in what he did, the king ordered his -<br>release. <br>o <br>It is narrated in Ihyaa-ul Uloom that there was a <br>B.k2 <br>pious man among the Israelites, who always remained <br>g 3  <br>busy in the worship of Allah.

None <br>else has the right to say that a certain person will not be <br>forgiven, but this does not mean that we should not warn <br>others against sins and undesirable things, and ask others <br>to desist from these. At hundreds of places in the Holy <br>Qur'an and in the books of hadith. there are warnings <br>against not forbidding from evil. It is stated in many aha-<br>dith that the people who see a sin being committed and do <br>not stop it. in spite of their having power to do so, will also <br>co <br>v,<br>share the punishment for that sin.

Bakhkha!) are exclaimed at the <br>time of extreme joy and pleasure. These things are of great <br>joy and pleasure to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)<br><br>32 <br>ment is well known and needs no introduction. Its good re- <br>sults soon began to be visible in India and abroad <br>generally, but especially so in the region of Mewat, as is <br>well-known. The fundamental principles of this movement <br>are basically very sound, good and strong, and are inhe- <br>rently fruitful and bedicial. One 'of the important prin- <br>ciples is that those who are engaged in Tableegh work <br>should be particular in practising zikr, and more so when <br>they are actually busy in Tabligh work. After observing the <br>wonderful results of this practice, I myself felt the neces- <br>sity of writing this booklet. I was also ordered by my re- <br>spected uncle that the virtues of zikr of Allah should be <br>compiled and made available to them, so that those who so <br>far practise it out of obedience to Allah may themselves <br>feel an urge for doing so for the sake of its virtues, and <br>thereby realise that zikr is a great wealth. <br>It is neither possible for a humble person like myself to <br>compile a comprehensive treatise on the virtues of zikr, nor <br>is it humanly possible to do full justice to this subject. I <br>have however briefly described some narrations relating to <br>this subject. I have divided the book into three chapters, of <br>hi h<br>h<br>i<br>f<br>ik<br>i<br>l<br>d<br>ib d i<br>h<br><br>the boundaries of Daarus Salaam (the Muslim territory) <br>against invasion by the infidels. <br>Hadith No 13 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When <br>you pass the gardens of Paradise, graze to your heart's <br>content.\" Someone asked. \"0 Kasulullah! (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), what is meant by the gardens of <br>Paradise?\" He replied, \"Gatherings for performing <br>zikr.\" <br>What is meant is that if somebodv is lucky enough to <br>get access to such gatherings. he should take full advantage <br>of this, as these are the gardens of Paradise on this Earth.<br><br>3. And when ye have completed your Hajj rites, then <br>remember Allah as ye remember your fathers, or with a <br>more lively remembrance. There are men who say, \"Our <br>Creator! Give unto us, Your bounties in this world,\" but <br>they will have no portion in the Hereafter.\" <br>There are men (also) who say, \"Our Creator! Give unto <br>us in the world that which is good and in the Hereafter that <br>which is good, and guard us from the doom of Fire.\" For <br>them, there is in store a goodly portion (in both worlds) out <br>of that which they have earned. Allah is swift at reckon- <br>ing. <br>It is related in a hadith that the du'aa of three persons <br>is not rejected rather it is surely accepted. (1)He who re- <br>members Allah profusely (2) A wronged person (3) A ruler <br>who avoids tyranny. <br>4.

It carries assurance not only in <br>respect of forgiveness but also in respect of prayers, health, <br>wealth and safety. For instance when a person prays to <br>Allah and sincerely believes that Allah shall accept his <br>prayer then his prayer is actually accepted but if he has<br><br>Ch. 1: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>29 <br>\"Hath he knowledge of the Unseen, or hath he made a <br>pact with the Beneficent.

Firstly, this is because Allah created man such that in- <br>herently he is liable to be good as well as to go astray, as <br>given below in Hadith No. 8. Submission on his part there- <br>fore deserves special appreciation. Secondly, at the time of <br>Aadam's creation, the Angels (who have no instinct for <br>doing evil) could not understand the creation of man and <br>had contended that he would cause blood-shed and trouble <br>+<br>O <br>in the world, while they are always there to praise and <br>glorify Almighty Allah. Thirdly, man's worship of Allah 13 <br>5<br>and submission to His will is more commendable than that <br>of the Angels, because he does so on account of his faith in <br>the unseen which, however, is actually seen by the angels. <br>It is to this fact that Allah refers in the Holy Book: \"How<br><br>as well, which are however left out in order to prevent the <br>discourse from getting too long. <br>Hadith No.2<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>31 <br>By saying that \"the commandments of Sharee-at are <br>many\", the Sahabi had meant that although observance of <br>every commandment is imperative, to specialize and attain <br>perfection in each and every one is difficult; and so he <br>wanted that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), may <br>recommend him something of over-riding importance <br>which he might hold fast to, and practise at all times and in <br>all conditions of sitting, standing or walking. <br>According to another hadith, a person who pos- <br>sesses the following four things is truly blessed, from <br>the worldly as well as spiritual point of view:- <br>(i) A tongue ever absorbed in the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah. <br>(ii) A heart filled with gratitude of Allah. <br>(iii) A body capable of undergoing hardships. <br>(iv) A wife who does not betray her husband's trust in <br>respect of her chastity and his wealth. <br>The phrase \"moist tongue\" according to some Ulama <br>means excessive utterance (of zikr) and, idiomatically, it is<br><br>HadithNo. 3 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to <br>his companions, \"Shall I tell you of something that is <br>the best of all deeds, constitutes the best act of piety in<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>because the value of every act of worship depends upon <br>ikhlaas (sincerity of the intention), which in turn depends <br>on the purity of heart. Therefore, according to some Sufis, <br>the zikr in this hadith implies the zikr of the heart as <br>against the zikr by the tongue. By the zikr of the heart, they <br>mean that the heart remains always conscious of, and in <br>communication with Almighty Allah. This state of the <br>heart is doubtless superior to all kinds of worship, because <br>when this state is attained, then omission of any kind of <br>worship is just not possible. All parts of the human body, <br>internal and external, are controlled by the heart and <br>submit completely to the Being to Whom the heart is at- <br>tached. The conduct of true lovers bears ample testimony <br>to this fact. <br>There are many more ahaadith that describe the <br>superiority of zikr over all other actions. Somebody en- <br>quired of Hazrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) as to what <br>action of man is most virtuous. He replied, \"Have you not <br>read in the Holy Qur'an,<br><br>ing salaat at home for seventy years. Although salaat is <br>unanimously admitted to be the best form of worship, yet <br>taking part in jihaad at the time of an invasion by the infi- <br>dels carries far greater reward. <br>Hadith No.4 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), said, \"There <br>are many a people who do zikr of .Almighty Allah, <br>while lying comfortably in their soft beds, and for this,<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>35 <br>person remembers Allah in times of peace, pleasure and <br>prosperity, then whenever he is in trouble and difficulty, <br>the angels, being familiar with his voice, recognise him in <br>his helplessness and intercede before Almighty Allah (for <br>his forgiveness); but, if one who does not remember Allah <br>in his time of pleasure and happens to pray for help at the <br>time of difficulty, the angels find his voice to be quite un- <br>familiar and therefore do not intercede for him.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"Para- <br>dise has eight gates, one of which is exclusively reserved <br>for those who are engaged in zikr.\" It is said in one hadith, <br>\"A person who constantly does zikr of Allah is immune <br>from hypocrisy in faith\", and according to another hadith, <br>\"He is loved by Almighty Allah.\" <br>Once during his return journey to Madina Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Where are those who <br>2<br>have gone ahead.\" The Companions said, \"The fast travel- <br>g & <br>lers have gone ahead\": then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe 8<br>wasallam) said, \"Those who remain ahead are the persons <br>who remain constantly absorbed in zikr. Whoever desires <br>to enjoy himself in Paradise, should do zikr of Allah ex- <br>cessively.\"<br><br>i <br>dead. Some scholars say that the contrast is in respect of <br>gain and loss. A man who harasses a zaakir is like one har- <br>assing a living being, and he will be avenged for this har- <br>assment and will suffer for it. One who ill-treats the <br>neglectful, ill-treats a dead body, which cannot avenge <br>itself. Some Sufis say that the hadith refers to the eternal <br>life of the zaakireen, because those who glorify Allah con- <br>stantly with sincerity never really die, but instead remain <br>spiritually alive even after passing away from this world. <br>The zaakireen also enjoy a special life after death, like the <br>martyrs, mentioned in a verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Nay, they are alive in the eyes of their Sustainer. <br>Hakiem Tirmizi writes, \"Zikr moistens the heart and <br>softens it. A heart that is devoid of zikr becomes dry and <br>hard, due to the excessive heat of lust and base desires. All <br>parts of the body likewise become stiff and abstain from <br>submission to Allah; if you try to bend them, they break<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>37 <br>According to one hadith, Almighty Allah also gives sa- <br>daqah every day, i.e. He showers His favours on the eople, <br>and everybody gets what he deserves, but the luc Eiest is <br>the person who is favoured with the ability to do His zikr. <br>People who are engaged in different occupations, such as <br>trade, farming and service, should spare some time for zikr <br>every day and thereby earn great rewards. It should not be <br>difficult to devote an hour or two out of 24 hours, exclus- <br>ively for this noble purpose. <br>A lot of our time is wasted in frivolous pursuits, and <br>some of this can be easily spared for this most useful work. <br>In another hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"The wisest of all people are <br>those who keep track of time, with the help of the sun, the <br>moon, the stars, and the shadows, for doing zikr regularly.\" <br>Nowadays we can determine time with the help of <br>* <br>watches, yet one should be able to judge time with the help <br>92 <br>of these natural agents, so that no time gets wasted in case <br>5<br>the watch stops or goes out of order. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the place where zikr is done, takes pride over <br>other parts of the earth.<br><br>relish this life it is were spent without the zikr of Allah. <br>Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah aiaih) writes in his book <br>\"Munabbihaat\" that Yahya bin Mu'aaz Raazi (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) used to say in his supplication: <br>0 Allah! the nigl.. is no good unless spent in com- <br>munion with You, the day is no good unless spent in <br>worshipping You, this life is no good without Your zikr, <br>the next life will be no good without forgiveness from You, <br>and Paradise will not be enjoyable without beholding You. <br>Hadhrat Sirri (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"I saw Jurjani <br>swallowing roasted barley flour. He told me that he had <br>compared the time taken in chewing bread and in eating <br>barley flour: eating bread took so much longer that he <br>could say <br>h<br>i <br>seventy times in that time. There- <br>fore, he had not taken bread for forty years, and had lived <br>by swallowing barley flour alone.\"<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) both bore testi- <br>mony to having heard from Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), that the gathering engaged in zikr of <br>Almighty Allah is surrounded by the angels on all <br>sides, the grace of Allah and sakeenah (peace and tran- <br>quility) descend upon them, and Almighty Allah <br>speaks about them, by way of appreciation, to His <br>angels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) related that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said to him, \"I <br>advise you to fear Allah, as this is the root of all virtues; <br>remain engaged in the recitation of Holy Qur'an and in zikr <br>of Almighty Allah, which will earn you an appreciation in <br>the Heavens and serve you as a light in this world; keep <br>silent for most of the time, so that you speak nothing but <br>good, as this will keep the Devil away from you and make <br>%+<br>E N<br>it easy for you to perform your religious duties, abstain also <br>$<br>from too much laughing, for laughing weakens the heart <br>and deprives the face of its spiritual glow (luminosity), <br>always take part in jihaad as this is the sign of piety for my <br>ummah; like the poor and keep their company; compare<br><br>Ch. II: Ahadith on Virtues ofKulirnuh 'l'uyytrbtrli 139 <br>4 <br>At the time of the death of the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), his companions were so <br>much shocked and grieved that many of them became <br>overwhelmed with frustration and doubts of various <br>sorts. Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"I <br>was also one of those who were given to frustration. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) came to me and <br>wished me salaam, but I was too absorbed to be aware <br>of his coming. He complained to Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) that I was displeased with him, so <br>much so that I did not respond even to his salaam. <br>Then both of them came to me and wished me salaam. <br>and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) enquired <br>8 3  <br>of me the reason why I had not responded to Umar's <br>Ei5 <br>salaam. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Yes, I <br>5 <br>swear by Allah, most certainly you did\". Idenied having be-<br>haved like this, and told them I did not even know of his <br>comin and wishing me salaam. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad-<br>hiyallAo anho) accepted my explanation and said that it<br><br>Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) interprets the pride on the <br>part of Almighty Allah to mean that He wants the angels to <br>realize, \"Despite the fact these humans are full of tempta- <br>tions, the Devil is after them, desires are inside them, the <br>worldly needs chase them, and yet they are engaged in <br>glorifying Almighty Allah, and so many deterrents cannot <br>prevent them from doing zikr: and therefore your zikr and <br>glorification, in the absence of any such handicaps is com- <br>paratively insignificant.\" <br>Hadith No 10<br><br>Ch.I: Ahaadith on Zikr<br>34 <br>ering condoned by reciting the following prayer at the <br>conclusion of the meeting: <br>\"Glory be to Allah with all kinds of praises. Glory be to <br>Thee, 0 Allah! with all Thy Praise; I stand witness that <br>there is no one to be worshipped except Thee. I seek Thy <br>forgiveness and turn (for mercy) to Thee.\" <br>It is narrated in another hadith that any gathering <br>devoid of Allah's zikr and salawaat will be a source of <br>dismay and loss. Then, out of His sheer mercy, Allah may <br>0 <br>grant forgiveness, or He may demand an explanation and <br>3 3  <br>penalize. It is stated in another hadith. \"Do proper justice <br>ea <br>5<br>to a gathering by remembering Allah profusely, show the <br>way to wayfarers (if need be), and close your eyes or cast <br>them down when you come across a forbidden thing. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Karamallaaho Wajhahoo) said, \"Whoso-<br><br>34 <br>As for such. Allah will change their evil deeds to good <br>deeds: and Allah is ever forgiving and most merciful. <br>The following are some comments made by the com- <br>mentators on this verse:- <br>1. All sins would be forgiven and only virtues would <br>remain (in the account); that no sin is left behind <br>(in the account) is itself a big change. <br>2. <br>Almighty Allah will enable them to do good deeds <br>when otherwise they would have committed bad <br>deeds, just as it is sometimes said, \"the heat was <br>replaced by the cold.\" <br>3. Their habits become related to virtues instead of <br>vices, so much so that doing good deeds becomes <br>their habit. Habits once formed become second <br>nature, which does not change. The Persian pro- <br>verb meaning that \"The mountain can move, but <br>not the habit\" refers to this fact. This proverb is <br>also derived from another hadith, \"You may be- <br>lieve if you hear that a mountain has moved from <br>its place, but do not believe if you are told that the<br><br>Ch. I:.Ahaadith on Zikr <br>45 <br>4. <br>Almighty Allah shifts the direction of the conduct <br>of such people from vices to virtues. <br>Almighty Allah guides him to repent for his sins. <br>He recollects his old sins, repents over them and <br>prays for forgiveness. Thus, for every sin pre-<br>viously committed, he gets the credit of one repen- <br>tance, which constitues a devotion and a virtue. <br>5. If Allah is pleased with the good deeds of some- <br>body, and through His sheer benevolence grants <br>him virtues equal to his sins, there is nobody to <br>question His authority. He is the Lord, He is the <br>King, He is All powerful, His mercy is boundless. <br>Who can close the door of His forgiveness? Who <br>can stop His bounty? He gives everything from His <br>own treasures. He will exhibit His powers and un- <br>limited forgiveness on the Day of Judgement. Vari- <br>ous scenes of reckoning on the Day of Judgement <br>are described in ahaadith, as briefly given in the <br>book, Bahjatun Nufoos. It is mentioned that reck- <br>oning will be conducted in different ways. \"Some <br>people will be examined in camera under the<br>% <br>8.2 <br>gz<br>$<br><br>Ch. III: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>46 <br>235 <br>ers will be the same as of the angels, i.e. reciting (+ILG) <br>etc., Almighty Allah will satisfy his hunger. This hadith <br>proves that in this life also one can live upon the zikr of <br>Allah, and without eating and drinking anything. When <br>such proficiency can be acquired by the common believers <br>at the time of Dajjaal, it is no wonder that the distinguished <br>ones attain this blessing even at this time. This suggests <br>that instances of some saints having lived without (or on <br>insufficient) food for days together should not be disbe- <br>lieved or refuted. <br>It is stated in one hadith that, when fire breaks out <br>anywhere <br>@%) <br>should be recited excessively, because <br>it is helpful in extinguishing the fire. It is written in the <br>book His-nu1 Haseen that if somebody feels difficulty or <br>weariness in doing some job and requires additional <br>c, <br>strength to overcome his shortcoming, he should recite <br>8 3  <br>(&I <br>33 times, <br>(Aljii) 33 times and <br>&iii) 34 <br>A<br>5<br>times, before going to-bed, or each of the three Kalimahs <br>should be recited 33 times or any one of the three may be <br>said 34 times. <br>Hafiz Ibn Taimiyah (Rahmatullah alaih) has deduced<br><br>lying under your pillow. By this money you can fulfil <br>your own needs, can oblige your relatives, help the <br>needy, and do soamany other virtuous things. Cutting <br>the tree will be only one virtue, which will ultimately <br>be of no use because the pebple will grow another <br>tree.\" This proposal appealed to the worshipper, and <br>he accepted it. He found the money on two successive <br>days, but on the third day there was nothing. He got <br>enraged. picked up his axe and went to cut the tree. <br>The old man again met him on the way and asked him <br>where he was going. \"To cut the tree\", shouted the <br>worshipper. \"I will not let you do it\", said the Satan. <br>An encounter ensured between the two, and this time <br>the Satan had the upper-hand and overpowered the <br>worshipper. The latter was surprised at his own defeat, <br>and asked the former the cause of his success. The <br>Satan replied, \"At first, your anger was purely for earn- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and therefore Almighty <br>Allah helped you to overpower me, but now it has <br>been partly for the sake of the gold coins and therefore <br>you lost.\" Truly speaking. a deed performed purely for <br>the pleasure of Allah alone carries great force<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>49 <br>Note: <br>How serious is the punishment in the rave can be <br>realized only by those who have the knowle fge of hadith <br>on this subject. Whenever Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) visited a grave, he would weep so much that his <br>beard would become wet with tears. Some one asked him, <br>\"How is it that mention of Paradise and Hell does not make <br>you weep so much as you do when you come across a <br>grave?\" He replied, \"The grave is the first of the many <br>stages of the Hereafter. For him who is successful or safe <br>during this stage, the later stages will also be easy; while <br>for a person who is not exempted in this stage, the later <br>stages will be even more difficult.\" Then he quoted Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as having said, \"I have <br>not come across any sight more terrifying than that of the 2 <br>grave.\" Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said, that <br>(BA<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to pray after <br>~<br>E<br>J<br> <br>every Salaat for protection against the chastisement in the 5 <br>grave. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) reported Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said, \"But for fear <br>that you might give up burying your dead, I would have<br><br>- <br>- <br>50 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>when an unbeliever or a transgressor is buried, the grave <br>says, \"Your coming here is unwelcome and abominable. <br>You had better not come here. Of all the people who have <br>been walking upon me, I hated ypu the most. Today you <br>have been made over to me, and you will see my treat- <br>ment.\" Then it narrows down and presses him mercilessly, <br>till his ribs pierce into each other as the fingers of the two <br>hands interlock each other. Then ninety or ninety nine <br>dragons are let loose upon him, and they will continue <br>clawing at him till the Day of Resurrection. If one of those <br>serpents or dragons were to blow on the earth, it will be <br>rendered incapable of growing any grass till the Day of <br>Judgement. Then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>continued. \"The grave is either a garden out of Paradise or <br>a pit out of Hell.\" <br>Accordine to another hadith. Rasulullah lsallallaho <br>----.-<br>alaihe wasallgm) happened to pass by two grave'~. He said, <br>\"The two persons buried in these graves are being pun- <br>ished, one for back-biting and the other for polluting his <br>bodv with his urine.\" It is a pity that many of our so-called <br>civilized people regard isti4aa (washingthe private parts <br>after urination) as an undignified act and even redicule it<br><br>Ch.

It is mentioned in one hadith <br>that the houses where zikr is practised shine unto the <br>dwellers of the Heaven, as do the stars shine unto the in- <br>habitants of the Earth. According to another hadith, sakee- <br>nah (a very special blessing) descends on the gathering <br>engaged in zikr, the angels surround them, the divine <br>mercy covers them, and Almighty Allah mentions them on <br>His Throne. <br>Hadhrat Abu Razeen (Radhiyallaho anho) a Sahabi, <br>narrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said.!\"Shall I tell you something that will strengthen your <br>Imaan and earn you the blessings of Allah, the Great, in <br>both the worlds? It is the gatherings of those who do zikr of <br>Almighty Allah; you should make it a point to take part in<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>53 <br>It is given in Tazkiratul Khaleel, the biography of Mau- <br>lana Khaleel Ahmad (May Allah enlighten his grave) that <br>Maulana Zafar Ahmad had related, \"When Maulana Kha- <br>lee1 Ahmad, on the occasion of his fifth Hajj, entered the <br>Masjidul Haraam for Tawaaful Qudoom, I was sitting in the <br>company of Maulana Muhibbuddeen, who was one of the <br>most trusted disciples of Maulana al-Haaj Imdaadullah Mu- <br>haajir Makki (May Allah enlighten his grave) and was well <br>known for his gift of divine foresight. He was then engaged <br>in his usual recitation of salawaat from a book, when all of <br>a sudden he turned to me and said, \"Who has entered the <br>Haram? The whole of the Haram has been flooded with his <br>radiance and light.\" I kept quiet. After a short while, Mau- <br>lana Khaleel Ahmad after completing his tawaaf happened <br>to pass by us. On seeing him Maulana Muhibbuddeen <br>stood up, smiled and said, \"Now indeed I see who has en- <br>tered the Haram today! \" <br>2 2<br>EN<br>The virtues of assembling for the sake of zikr have <br>5<br>been described in different ways in so many other ahaa- <br>dith. In one hadith, it is stated that salaat and gatherings for <br>zikr constitute the best ribaat. Ribaat stands for guarding <br>the boundaries of Daarus Salaam (the Muslim territory)<br><br>1 <br>The words, \"graze to your heart's content\", signify that, <br>just as an animal grazing in a green pasture or garden does <br>not give up grazing in spite of being driven or beaten by its <br>owner, similarly a zaakir (one who practises zikr) should <br>not get pulled away from the gatherings for zikr by the <br>worldly anxieties and hindrances. The gatherings for zikr <br>are likened to the gardens of Paradise, because just as there <br>are no worries in the paradise, similarly gatherings of zikr <br>are safeguarded against every kind of calamity. <br>It is stated in one hadith that the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah cures all diseases of the mind, such as arrogance, <br>jealousy, malice, etc. The author of 'Fawaa'id fis Salaah <br>wal Awaa'id' has stated that constancy in zikr is a sure <br>safeguard against all kinds of calamities. According to an- <br>other hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has <br>said, \"I enjoin on you to do zikr of Allah profusely. It is <br>like taking refuge in a fort against a strong enemy. One who <br>practises zikr is as if it were in the company of Almighty <br>Allah.\" Can there be any benefit greater than that of being <br>in the company of the Almighty Lord? Moreover, it leads to <br>satisfaction of the mind, it enlightens the heart and re-<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>Hadith No 14 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"One <br>who is too weak to bear the strain of keeping awake at <br>night (in the worship of Almighty Allah), is too mi- <br>serly to spend his wealth in the path of Allah, and is <br>$ <br>8 2<br>too cowardly to take part in jihaad, is advised to <br>g~<br>remain engaged in the zikr of Allah.\" <br>i' <br>This shows that deficiencies in respect of non-obliga- <br>tory form of worship can be atoned through profuse zikr of <br>Almighty Allah. Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) re-<br><br>I <br>generate that no amount of treatment can restore their <br>strength to compare with that of the Sahabah. Nevertheless, <br>whatever improvement is effected is worthwhile at this <br>time when the disease has taken the form of an epidemic. <br>It is related about a holy man that he prayed to <br>Almighty Allah that he may be shown how Satan prevails <br>upon the heart. He found that the Satan sits like a mosquito <br>over the left side of the heart under the back of the shoul- <br>der and then advances his needle-like snout towards the <br>heart. If he finds the heart buzy in zikr he withdraws at <br>once, but if the heart is idle he injects the poison of evil <br>and sinful thoughts into it. It is stated in one hadith that <br>Satan keeps on sitting with the top of his nose over the <br>heart, and if the heart is buzy in zikr he withdraws in dis- <br>grace, but if it is idle he makes a morsel of it. <br>Hadith No 15<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>Ibn Katheer (Rahmatullah alaih) has narrated, on the <br>authority of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) \"Nothing has been made obligatory by Almighty <br>Allah without fixing maximum limit for it and excusing <br>shortcomings in respect of it, except His zikr, for which no <br>limit has been fixed and no person, as long as he is sane is <br>exempted from it.\" Almighty Allah has ordered in the Holy <br>Quran: <br>\"Practise zikr of Allah excessively.\" A person should <br>do zikr under all circumstances, whether by day or <br>night; whether in the jungle or at sea; whether travel- <br>ling or halting; whether in. affluence or poverty; , <br>whether in sickness or health; whether loudly or <br>quietly. <br>j&g &  <br>In his book 'Munabbihaat', Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahmatul- 5 <br>lah alaih) writes that Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>while explaining the Quranic verse<br><br>Hafiz (Rahmatullah alaih) has also stated on the auth- <br>ority of Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Hazrat Jibra-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) laid so much stress on doing zikr that I <br>felt that without zikr nothing can benefit whatsoever.\" <br>The above mentioned quotations show that one should <br>practise zikr as much as possible; giving it up simply be- <br>cause others may call one mad or a hypocrite is fraught <br>with serious loss to oneself. The Sufis have written that it <br>is also a trap on the part of Satan that at first he discourages <br>one from zikr on the plea of avoiding criticism by the <br>people and, if he succeeds in this attempt, he is encouraged <br>and exploits this fear of criticism for preventing the person <br>from doing zikr forever. Although one should not do any <br>good deed for the sake of a show, yet if anybody happens to <br>see it one should not thereupon give it up. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah Zul Bajadeen (Radhiyallaho anhb), a <br>Sahabi, became an orphan in his childhood. He lived with <br>his uncle, who looked after him well. He had embraced <br>Islaam secretly and, when his uncle came to know of it, in <br>his anger, he turned him out of the house stark naked. His<br><br>35 <br>Ch. I: .Ahaadith on Zikr <br>by the people is in itself an act of hypocrisy, and a good <br>action done with the intention to make a show amounts to <br>Shirk (false worship).\" <br>It is stated in one hadith that some persons are the <br>keys to zikr, i.e. their very sight reminds and inspires other <br>people to do zikr of Allah. According to another hadith, <br>such people are the friends of Allah whose very sight <br>makes others remember Almighty Allah. It is stated in one <br>hadith, \"The best amongst you are the people whose very <br>sight reminds you of Allah.\" Similarly it is stated in an- <br>other hadith, \"The best amongst you are those whose sight <br>makes you remember Almighty Allah, whose words add to <br>your knowledge, and whose actions induce you to work for <br>the love of the Hereafter.\" Of course, such a condition can <br>be attained by one who practises zikr profusely. One who <br>is himself indolent in this respect, his sight can hardly <br>inspire others to remember Allah. <br>2d <br>Some people regard zikr in loud voice as an innovation <br>E N  <br>i-<br>and forbidden in religion, but this view is due to lack of in- <br>sight into the knowledge of hadith. Maulana Abdul Hay, <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) has written a booklet 'Sabahatul Fikr' <br>on this very subject wherein he has quoted about fifty<br><br>35 <br>just ruler (2) A young man who worships Allah in his <br>youth (3) A person whose heart yearns for the musjid <br>(4) Those two persons who love, meet and depart only <br>for the pleasure of Allah. (5)A man who is tempted by <br>a beautiful woman and refuses to respond for fear of <br>Allah. (6)A person who gives alms so secretly that the <br>charity of one hand is not known to the other hand. (7) <br>A person who practises zikr of Allah in solitude, so <br>that tears flow of his eyes.\" <br>The flowing of tears can mean deliberate weeping, due <br>to repentance over one's past sins, but it may also mean a <br>spontaneous outburst of tears due to overwhelming passion <br>of love. Thaabit Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted <br>the words of a pious man, \"I come to know when a prayer <br>of mine is accepted.\" When asked as to how he comes to <br>know of it, he said, \"That prayer, at the time of which the <br>hair on my body stand up, my heart starts beating rapidly <br>and my eyes shed tears, is accepted by Allah.\" Among the <br>seven persons mentioned in the foregoing hadith, is in- <br>cluded also the person who weeps while doing zikr in soli- <br>tude. He combines two sublime qualities: first ikhlaas,<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr<br>61 <br>hadith, because the presence or absence of others makes no <br>difference to him. His heart is free from the thoughts, not <br>only of his companions, but also of everything other than <br>Almighty Allah. The presence of others cannot distract him <br>from his attention towards Allah. <br>To be able to weep for fear and love of Allah implies <br>possession of great spiritual wealth. Fortunate is he who is <br>blessed with it by Almighty Allah. It is stated in one hadith <br>that a person who weeps for fear of Allah will not be sent <br>to Hell till the milk goes back into the teats of an animal <br>(which is imposssible). This implies that it is similarly im- <br>possible for such a person to go to Hell. According to an- <br>other hadith, a person who weeps for fear of Allah will not <br>be punished on the Day of Judgement. <br>It is stated in one hadith that the fire of Hell is forbid- <br>den for two eyeszone that sheds tears for fear of Allah, and <br>the other that has remained awake in guarding the Muslims * <br>and Islaam against the infidels. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the fire of Hell is forbidden on the eye that has <br>gN <br>wept for fear of Allah, on the eye that has remained awake <br>in the path of Allah, on the eye that has refrained from the <br>unlawful and also on the eye that has been lost in the path<br><br>ation of the Heaven and the Earth, and would say, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou hast not created all this in vain. We glo- <br>rify Thee: save us from the fire of Hell.\" Thereafter a <br>flag will appear for them. and they will follow this flag <br>and will be told to enter Paradise and stag for ever.\" <br>By \"pondering over the creation of the Heaven and the <br>Earth\" is meant that they contemplate over the phenomena <br>and secrets of the things created by Allah, and thereby <br>strengthen their spiritual knowledge. <br>The whole universe is like a garden planned and <br>planted by Allah. <br>As narrated by Ibn Abid Dunyaa, Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once approached a group of Sahabah <br>who were sitting in silence. He asked them what they were <br>thinking about. The Sahabah replied that they were pon- <br>dering over the wonderful creations cf Allah. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated it and said \"Do<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>63<br>eignty) for men of understanding such as .remember <br>Allah standing, sitting and reclining . . . . <br>Then he added, 'Destruction is for the person who, in <br>spite of reading these verses, does not ponder over His cre- <br>ation.\" <br>Aamir bin Abdul Qais (Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"I <br>heard from the Sahabah not from one or two or three, but <br>from many of them-that the light and radiance of faith lies <br>in contemplation and meditation.\" Hadhrat Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrated, from Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) that a person lying on the roof of his <br>house was looking at the sky and stars for some time, and <br>then said, \"I swear by Allah and I believe there is some- <br>body who has created you all; 0 Allah! forgive me for my <br>sins.\" Thereupon Allah's mercy turned towards him and <br>he was forgiven. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said that meditation for a short duration of time is better <br>than worshipping throughout the night. Similarly, Hadhrat <br>Anas, (Radhiyallaho anho] narrated that meditation over <br>the creations of Allah is better than doing worship for <br>eighty years. Somebody asked Hadhrat Umme Darda (Rad-<br><br>"

Abu <br>Sa'eed Khazzaar (Rahmatullah alaih) also states that he <br>once saw in a dream that Satan attacked him and he tried <br>to beat him back with a stick, but the Satan did not care for <br>this beating. Then he heard a heavenly voice saying that <br>the devil is not scared away by the beating, he is only <br>frightened by the spiritual light in one's heart. <br>Hadhrat Sa'od (Radhiyallaho anho) quoted Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said, \"The best zikr is <br>the silent one, and the best livelihood is that which just <br>suffices\", (i.e. it should neither be too insufficient to make <br>both ends meet, nor too abundant as to drive one to vanity <br>and vice). In another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said. \"Remember Allah <br>O <br>through perfect zikr\". When somebody enquired; \"What is <br>perfect zikr.\" He replied, \"Silent zikr.\" All the above <br>quoted narrations establish the excellence of zikr in si- ji<br>5 <br>lence. We have also read the hadith that favours loud zikr, <br>as of a mad man. Either form of zikr is important under dif- <br>ferent sets of conditions. It is for the Shaikh (religious<br><br>search of such people; he found a group of men who were <br>engaged in zikr. Some of them were with dishevelled hair, <br>parched skins, and clad in a single cloth i.e. except for the <br>loin cloth, the whole body was naked. On seeing them, Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sat down by them <br>and said, \"All praise is for Allah who has created in my <br>ummah such people that I have been ordered to sit in their <br>company.\" <br>According to aiother hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went out in search of them and found <br>them in the farthest part of the mosque, where they were <br>busy in zikr of Almighty Allah. He said, \"All praise is for <br>Allah Who has created, during my lifetime, such people <br>that I have been ordered to sit with them.\" Then he con- <br>tinued, \"My life and death is with you\" (i.e. You are my <br>companions in life and death.) It is mentioned in one <br>hadith that a group of Sahabah, including Hadhrat Salmaan <br>Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho) were engaged in zikr of Allah, <br>when Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>them. They became all silent. In reply to his enquiry as to <br>what they were doing, they submitted that they were prac- <br>ti i<br>ik<br>f All h R<br>l ll h (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>67<br>the other hand, if somehow one happens to be in a group of <br>the negligent, and even there he keeps busy with zikr of <br>Allah, great reward is also promised for him, as stated in <br>many ahaadith. On such occasions, it is all the more <br>necessary that one should remain absorbed in remem-<br>brance of Allah, so that he is immune from the evil effect of <br>such company. <br>According to one hadith, a person who remains en- <br>gaged in zikr, while in the company of the negligent is like <br>one who remains steadfast in his allotted position in a <br>jihaad (holy war), while his companions are fleeing for <br>their lives. In another hadith, he is like one who fights the <br>infidels single-handed, after his companions have fled <br>away. He is also likened to a lamp in a dark house or a <br>beautiful green tree in autumn, when all the trees have <br>%<br>shed their leaves. Almighty Allah will show him before- <br>hand his abode in the Paradise; all his sins, even if equal to <br>2 +<br>the number of all men and animals, will be forgiven. All <br>these rewards are subject to the condition that one remains g h  <br>engaged in zikr while in the company of the negligent; <br>otherwise it is forbidden even to join in such meetings. <br>According to one hadith, one should keep away from <br>h<br>ll d f i<br>dl<br>h<br>i<br>h<br>h<br>i<br>hi<br><br>Fajr salaat and after Asr salaat, and I will suffice for <br>you during the intervening periods.\" <br>In one hadith it is stated, \"Do zikr of Allah, He will <br>look after your interests.\" <br>Note: <br>We work so hard for this worldly life, though not for <br>the life Hereafter. We lose nothing if we remember Allah <br>for a little while after Fajr and after Asr, because so many <br>virtues have been mentioned for doing zikr at these two <br>times. When Almighty Allah promises His full help, what <br>more is needed? <br>According to one hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said, \"I prefer sitting with those who remain <br>busy in remembering Allah after Fajr prayer up to sunrise, <br>to the noble act of setting four Arab slaves free; and simi- <br>larly I prefer sitting with ths group who remain busy in <br>zikr !of Allah after Asr salaat up to sunset to setting four <br>slaves free.\" According to another hadith, if a person offers <br>Fajr salaat in congregation and remains engaged in zikr of <br>Allah until sunrise, and then offers two rakaats of nafl<br><br>"

This world and the Hereafter belong <br>to Him and He is worthy of all praise; life and death are <br>controlled by Him, and He controls the destiny of every- <br>thing. <br>According to another hadith, whosoever, after Fajr and <br>Asr, recites three times the following prayer: <br>I seek pardon of Allah, except whom there is nobody <br>worthy of worship and Who is living and eternal; I turn to <br>Him. <br>All hi<br>i<br>if bi lik<br>h<br>ill b f<br>i<br><br>Allah, in which case all the things that are helpful in doing <br>zikr, such as eating and drinking in reasonable quantities, <br>and all other necessities of life, as also all forms of worship <br>are implied therein; or it may mean the things near to <br>Allah, in which case it will mean all forms of worship of <br>Allah, and the zikr would mean special form of zikr. In <br>both cases, 'ilm is included therein, because in the first <br>case, it is 'ilm that leads one to zikr, and whereas an ignor- <br>ant man cannot recognize.Allah and in the second case be- <br>cause 'ilm (i.e. religious knowledge) is the best form of <br>worship. In spite of this, the 'aalim and the student have <br>been specially mentioned separately for emphasis. 'ilm, <br>indeed, is a great wealth. <br>According to one hadith, \"Learning 'ilm just for the <br>pleasure of Allah is a proof of the fear of Allah, travelling <br>in search of it is a worship, memorizing it is like glorifying <br>Allah, making research in it is like jihaad, reading it is like <br>chari!~, and teaching it to one's members of family pro- <br>motes nearness to Allah. This is because 'ilm enables one <br>to distinguish between right and wrong; it is the road sign <br>indicating the way to Paradise: it provides consolation in <br>wilderness and a conlpanion while travelling<br>because<br>1 I<br><br>i <br>Almighty Allah as his sole Cherisher, Guardian <br>and Master, and he turns unto Him, in all afflic- <br>tions. <br>I <br>(12) It is the key to nearness to Almighty Allah; the <br>greater the zikr, the greater the nearness to Allah, <br>and greater the indifference to zikr, the greater the <br>distance from Him. <br>(13)It opens the door of Ma'rifat (realization) of Allah. <br>(14)It makes one realize the greatness and grandeur of <br>Almighty Allah, and strengthens the conscious- <br>ness of his omni-presence. <br>(15)Zikr of Allah causes one's mention in the Court of <br>Allah, as said in the Holy Book. <br>% <br>Remember me, and I will remember you, <br>and as stated in a hadith<br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>73 <br>(19) It safeguards against pitfalls and lapses. <br>(20) The heart of a neglectful person is tormented by a <br>feeling of remoteness from Allah, and nothing <br>other than zikr can rid the heart of this feeling. <br>(21) The words of zikr keep on moving round the Arsh <br>of Almighty Allah, as stated in a hadith. <br>(22) If one remembers Allah in happiness, Almighty <br>Allah remembers him in his afflictions. <br>(23) It is a means to deliverance from Allah's punish- <br>ment. <br>(24) It causes Allah's peace and mercy to descend, <br>while angels surround the person engaged in zikr. <br>(25) It saves the tongue from indulging in backbiting, <br>loose talk, lies and abuses. It is a common experi- <br>ence that a man whose tongue remains engaged in <br>zikr does not commit these absurdities. On the <br>other hand, the tongue that is not used in zikr, <br>falls an easy prey to all kinds of useless talk. <br>'z-<br>9 3 <br>y N <br>S<br><br>du'aa and supplication. According to one hadith, <br>Almighty Allah says that I will give better reward <br>to one who is abstained by his engagements in zikr <br>from making du'aa than all those who find time <br>for making du'aa. <br>(31)In spite of the fact that zikr is the easiest f ~ r l i iof <br>worship (the movement of the tongue being easier <br>than the movement of any other party of the body), <br>yet it is the most virtuous form. <br>(32)Allah's zikr helps the plants of Paradise to grow. <br>(33)Of all actions the reward and forgiveness promised <br>for zikr is the highest. According to one hadith if <br>on any day a person repeats one hundred times <br>the kalimah: <br>There is none worthy of worship except Allah, the <br>One. There is no partner with Him; His is the king- <br>dom and for Him is all praise and He is All-pow-<br><br>Ch.

Protec- <br>tion against this ruin can only be provided by <br>keeping one's tongue always busy in zikr, so that <br>zikr should become as indispensable as water is at <br>the extreme thirst, or food at the time of hunger, or <br>the house and clothes for protection against ex-<br>treme heat and cold. As a matter of fact, one <br>should be more mindful of zikr than any of these <br>material necessities, which at the most can result <br>in physical death, which is a small loss as com- <br>pared with the spiritual death. <br>(35)Zikr \t is the source of one's spiritual elevation <br>whether done in bed or in the market, whether in <br>% <br>good health or in sickness, or even when one is <br>8 5  <br>making most of the pleasures of life. Nothing but <br>g 3<br>zikr can take a man to such spiritual heights, <br>5 <br>whereby his heart is so illuminated with the light <br>of zikr that even asleep he is more wakeful than <br>the neglectful person who is awake all through the <br>night<br><br>36 <br>1 \t<br>alaihe wasallam) prayed that Almighty Allah may <br>bless his flesh, bones, muscles, hair, skin, eyes and <br>ears with noor, and that he may be surrounded <br>with noor on all sides; he even prayed that he may <br>be blessed with noor from top to bottom, and that <br>his whole person may be made into noor. One's <br>deeds will shine according to the noor in oneself, <br>so much so that the good deeds of some people <br>(while going upto heaven) will shine like the sun. <br>Similar noor will be found in their faces on the <br>Day of Judgement. <br>(37)Zikr is the basic principle of Tasawwuf (Sufism) <br>and is invoked in all the schools of Sufism. A <br>person who gets conversant with zikr enters the <br>gateway to Almighty Allah, and one who enters <br>this gateway is sure to reach Almighty Allah, from <br>Whom he will get whatever he wants, for Allah's <br>treasures are unlimited. <br>(38)There is not a corner in the heart of a man, which <br>can not be filled but with zikr. When zikr controls <br>the heart, not only does it fill up this corner, but<br><br>Ch. I: .Ahaadith on Zikr <br>77 <br>(41)Zikr is just like a tree, the fruit of which is realiza- <br>tion of Almighty Allah. The more zikr is done, the <br>stronger shall grow the root of this tree; and <br>stronger the root of this tree, the more abundant <br>the fruit it will bear. <br>(42)Zikr of Almighty Allah promotes nearness to Him <br>and thereby earns His constant patronage. It is <br>given in the Quran <br>ljih j;$l <br>b 5! <br>No doubt Allah is with those who fear Him. <br>It is stated in one hadith <br>. - '<br>&w j& <br>J <br>(I <br>0 <br>I am with my slave who remembers Me. \t<br>$$ <br>EN <br>According to another hadith, Allah says, \"Those <br>i' <br>who remember Me are My men, and I do not de- <br>prive them of My mercy. When they repent, I am <br>their friend, but when they do not repent. I am<br><br>1 <br>thanks worthy of Your greatness.\" Almighty Allah <br>replied, \"Let your tongue always remain engaged <br>in zikr.\" <br>(45)According to Almighty Allah, the best of the pious <br>people are those who always remain busy in zikr, <br>because piety leads to paradise, and zikr to the <br>nearness to Allah: <br>(46)There is a sort of hardness in the human heart, <br>which is not softened by anything except zikr. <br>(47)In fact, zikr is a remedy for all ills of the heart. <br>(48)Zikr of Allah is the root of His love, and neglecting <br>zikr is the root of His enmity. -<br>(49)Nothing is more effective than zikr in attracting <br>Allah's blessings and in warding off His chastise- <br>ment. <br>(50)Almighty Allah grants His grace to those who do <br>zikr, and the angels pray for them. <br>(51)One who wants to remain in the gardens of Para-<br><br>Ch.

I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>81<br>zikr. It is related on the authority of Hadhrat Amr <br>bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) that when a man says <br>j <br>1 9% <br>9.1 <br>the angels pray to <br>4; A-l;iji <br>Almighty Allah for his forgiveness. <br>(67)The mountain or plain on which zikr is recited <br>feels proud of it. According to a hadith, one moun- <br>tain asks another if any zaakir has crossed over it <br>during the day. If the.reply is in the affirmative. it <br>feels happy. <br>(68)Zikr guarantees immunity from hypocrisy, for <br>Almighty Allah has described the hypocrite as <br>% YI i l  b;;ij; <br>y They do not remember Allah except <br>very rarely. It is also related on the authority of <br>Ka'b Ahbaar (Radhiyallaho anho) that he who <br>makes frequent zikr of Allah is free from hypoc- <br>risy. <br>e l  <br>(69)Compared with other good deeds, zikr carries a <br>special taste, which is not to be found in any other <br>action.

The tongue will engage itself in useless talk if <br>it is not in zikr, because it-cannot remain quiet. So <br>1<br>is the case with the heart; if it is devoid of love for <br>Almighty Allah, it will be filled with the love of <br>I <br>worldly things. <br>(73)The devils are outright enemies of man and always <br>create trouble for him and keep him surrounded. <br>I <br>The miserable condition of one who remains sur- <br>rounded by enemies can well be imagined, espec- <br>ially when the enemies are vindictive and <br>everyone of them wants to surpass the other in <br>troubling him. Nothing except zikr can protect <br>him against these enemies. Many forms of du'aa <br>are mentioned in the ahaadith, so that, if any of <br>these is recited by a person, then Satan dare not <br>come near him. If the same is recited at the time of <br>going to bed, one remains safe from the Satan <br>throughout the night. Hafiz Ibn Qayyim (Rahma- <br>tullah<br>alaih) has<br>also<br>mentioned<br>many<br>such<br><br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Tell me if anybody <br>can reach the sky by piling up his goods one over the other. <br>I tell you of something, which has its roots in the Earth and <br>its branches spread out into the Heaven. It is recitation of <br>the kalimah <br>ten times each after every salaat. <br>(2) \t Whosoever desires glory and power (should know) that <br>L. <br>glory and all powers belong to Allah; Unto Him good <br>sg<br>words ascend and He exalts all righteous deeds. <br>tfN<br>-<br>According to the majority of :o~mentators, the Kali- <br>S <br>mah Tayyibah in this ayat means (&Iys ir!9), but some are of <br>the opinion that it implies the kalimah of tasbeeh. as will <br>be described in part 11.<br><br>and this is meant by the words (firm statement) in this ayat. <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) also corroborated <br>that it refers to the interrogation in the grave. Hadhrat Ibn <br>Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"When a Muslim is about <br>to die, the angels come to him, greet him, and convey the <br>glad tidings of paradise; after his death, they accompany <br>him and join his funeral prayer; and after he is buried, they <br>make him sit up when, in the grave, questioning starts. He <br>replies <br>'I bear witness that there is nobody worthy of worship <br>except Allah. and I bear witness that Muhammad is the <br>messenger of Allah.' <br>'I'his is what is implied in this ayat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Qataadah.

If per- <br>chalice you commit anv sin. hasten at once to do some vir- <br>tuous deed so that the sin is atoned, and it is written off.\" <br>'Then Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) continues to say that he <br>asked Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if this kali- <br>mah <br>I <br>was also counted amongst the virtues. <br>At this, Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave the <br>replv that this kalimah is the highest of all virtues. It is <br>likewise quoted from Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said <br>\"Whosover, any time during the day or night, recites the <br>kalimah <br>I <br>! <br>. his sins are washed off his ac-<br>count.\" <br>(9) \t (a) Lo!

Such are those whom Allah <br>guideth, and such are men of understanding. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'eed bin Zaid, Hadhrat Abu Zar Ghifaari and Hadhrat <br>'b<br>Salmaan Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho), all the three, used to <br>~l 2 <br>L <br>recite the kalimah <br>I <br>even before they em-<br>5EN <br>braced Islaam, and by the words <br>I <br>I <br>(the best ut- <br>terance) what is exactly meant in thls sacred ayat is this <br>kalimah. Hadhrat Zaid bin Aslam (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>also said that this ayat relftes to three persons who used to<br><br>words Z L ' l i  ;& 2-i\" (one who brought the true message <br>froni Allah) refers to Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and the words <br>2 <br>(those who confirmed it) <br>refer to the believers. <br>(13)In the case of those who say, \"Our Lord is Allah\", and <br>afterwards are steadfast, the angels descend upon them <br>saying, \"Fear not, nor grieve but hear good tidings of <br>the Paradise which you were promised. We are your <br>protecting friends in the life of the world and in the <br>Hereafter. There you will have all that your souls <br>desire, and then vou will have what you pray for. A <br>gift of welcome from the forgiving the Merciful.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that the<br><br>37 i<br>(purified) means he declared his faith i n h  j>;s<br>311 u'! i!Y and <br>gave up idol-worship.

Its further elaboration is that Allah will so grace <br>a man as to make good deedseasy for him, which will ex- <br>pedite his entry to Paradise. Many commentators are of the <br>view that the above-mentioned ayat was revealed in favour <br>of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>the word (&I) <br>(good thing) mentioned in this ayat means <br>the kalimah 31j!d!Y) .

There are still many more verses, which equally <br>convey the same sense and meaning of the Kalimah as I <br>have stated in the beginning of this section. Tauheed is the <br>fundamental basis of Deen, and therefore the more ac-<br>quainted a man is with the requirements of Tauheed, the <br>more steadfast he shall be in Deen. Tauheed in the Holy <br>Qur'an has been described from various viewpoints and in <br>various manners and aspects, so that it may penetrate <br>through the very depths of the heart; so it firmly settles <br>there, leaving no room for anything else to enter. <br>I 3<br>1 <br>~<br><br>the Cherisher of all the universe). <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated: \"There <br>is not the slightest doubt that Kalimah Tayyibah is by far <br>the best and foremost of all azkaar because it is the root and <br>fundamental basis of the Deen and the whole religion of <br>1slam.centres round it. It is for this reason that the Sufis <br>and saints emphasise its importance and prefer it over all <br>other azkaar and advise their followers to practise it as <br>much as possible. Also, actual experience has shown that, <br>the benefits following from Kalimah Tayyibah far out-<br>number those which result from other forms of zikr. <br>There is a well-known story of Sayyid Ali bin May- <br>moon Maghrabi. Once Shaikh Ulwan Hamawi, who himself <br>was a great scholar, Mufti and teacher of his age, came for <br>learning zikr. The Sayyid (Kahmatullah alaih) devoted <br>special attention to him and made hinl give up all his rou- <br>tines, such as teaching and writing fatawa, and to take up <br>zikr all the time. On this, the common people started freely <br>indulging in fault finding and condemnation. They started <br>a campaign of criticism that the Shaikh has now been lost <br>to them and the people were being deprived of his benefits. <br>A f<br>d<br>l t<br>h<br>th<br>S<br>id (R h<br>t ll h<br>l ih)<br>I<br><br>Ch. II: Ahadith on.Virtues of Kalimah I'ayyabah <br>109 <br>man on Earth who remembers Almighty Allah, Qiyaamat <br>(Doomsday) will not take place. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: \"Once the prophet Moosa (Alayhis salaam)<br><br>hearts (<br>4<br>1 s*) <br>. For its purifying effect, Sufis prescribe zikr <br>of this Kalimah and advise its recitation as a daily routine, <br>not only in hundreds but in thousands of times. Mulla Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that a disciple once com- <br>plained to his Shaikh that, despite doing zikr, his heart re- <br>mained inattentive. The Shaikh replied: \"Go on with your <br>zikr firmly, and thank Almighty Allah for His Grace that He <br>enabled a part of your body. i.e. the tongue, to remain busy <br>in His zikr, and pray to Allah for a devoted heart.\" A simi- <br>lar incident is related in Ihyaa-ul Uloom about Abu Usman <br>I<br>Maghribi, who gave the same reply on a similar con~plaint <br>made by one of his disciples, and he prescribed the same <br>cure. As a matter of fact, zikr is the best remedy for indo- <br>lence of the heart. Almighty Allah says in His Book, \"If you <br>show gratitude to Me, I will grant even more than before.\" <br>Likewise the hadith says \"zikr of Almighty Allah is a great <br>blessing; and be thankful to Him in as much as He has en- <br>abled you to do His zikr.\" <br>Hadith No 3<br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 111 <br>the Kalimah with Ikhlaas Miil be most deserving to be ben- <br>efitted by the intercession of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, such a <br>person could be one who has just embraced Islaam with <br>sincerity of heart, and has done no other good deed except <br>the recitation of the Kalimah. Evidently he can be helped <br>only by virtue of this intercession, because he has no deed <br>to his credit. In this case, this hadith is corroborated by <br>other ahadith, in which it is stated that the intercession <br>will be for those guilty of major sins who shall have been <br>sent to the Hell because of their sins, but by virtue of their <br>recitation of the Kalimah Tayyibah they will be released <br>through the intercession of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). Secondly, the most deserving people to be ben- <br>efitted will be those who continually recite this Kalimah <br>with sincerity and they have to their credit other good <br>'8 <br>deeds as well. Being most fortunate means that they will be <br>8 & <br>benefitted more than by anything else by the intercession <br>%z <br>of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in raising their <br>a <br>status in Paradise. <br>Allama Ainee (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will intercede in six<br><br>i<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"There is <br>nobody who may recite (A1 g!qY) and the doors of the <br>Heavens do not get opened to allow this Kaliinah to <br>1<br>reach the Arshi Ilaahi (Allah's throne), provided he <br>1<br>abstains from the major sins.\" <br>The extreme excellence and acceptability of this Kali- <br>mah is proved by its going straight to the Arshi Ilaahi <br>(throne of Allah). It has already been stated that its recita- <br>tion, even with major sins, is not without benefit. Muila Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the condition of being <br>free from major sins is the key to quick acceptance and for <br>the opening of all the doors of Heaven; otherwise the reci- <br>t ti<br>f K li<br>h i<br>t<br>ith<br>t<br>d<br>d<br>t<br>i<br><br>I <br>117<br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kulirnuh 'I'uyyubuh <br>I <br>l$as,u13ullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"Recite <br>Y!il!jij very often, before the time of death comes <br>when'you will not be able to say it.\" <br>Note: <br>It means that no deed is possible after death. This life <br>is very short, but it is the only time for action and for <br>sowing the seeds. This life after death is infinitely long. <br>and we will there reap whatever we have sown here. <br>Hadith No. 9<br><br>I<br>with proper discharge of one's obligations enjoined by it, as <br>given under Hadith No 4 above. Hasan Basri (Ratlmatullah <br>alaih) and many others also held the same view. According <br>to the considered view of Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) Allah's promise holds good if the declaration of the <br>Kalimah before death is with repentance, which is the es- <br>sence of Taubah while, according to Mulla Ali Qari, the re- <br>citer will not be doomed to Hell-for ever. Moreover, it is a <br>matter of common observation that sometimes the inherent <br>quality of a thing becomes ineffective due to some counter- <br>force. For instance, a purgative may become ineffective if it <br>is followed by a strong constipative drug, but that does not <br>mean that the purgative has become devoid of its inherent <br>effect; it has only not worked because of the strong counter- <br>acting agent. <br>Hadith No 10<br><br>I <br>119<br>Ch. 11: Ahudjth on irirtues of Kc~lirnuh'I'u!.\\'abnh<br>I <br>Hadith No 11 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"1Vhoso- <br>ever recites 3,ii!W, any time during day or night. his sins <br>are remitted from his account and virtues are written <br>instead.\" <br>Note: <br>The replacement of sins by virtues has been fully de- <br>scribed under Hadith No 10 of Chapter 1, part 2, where <br>various meanings of all the aayats and ahadith of this kind <br>are given. According to every version, this hadith categori- <br>cally states that sins are washed away from the account of a <br>person's deeds, provided there is Ikhlaas, that is sincerity <br>f i t<br>ti<br>I<br>h<br>i<br>th<br>bl<br>d<br>f<br><br>Thereupon Allah says: 'Well, I have forgiven him', and <br>then that pillar stops shaking.\" <br>Note: <br>I <br>Some scholars of hadith have doubted authenticity of <br>this hadith, but Allanla Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>written that this hadith (tradition) in different words has <br>been narrated through many sources. According to some <br>narrations. Almighty Allah also says, \"I have made him <br>utter the Kalimah in order that I may grant him forgive- <br>ness.\" How kind and benevolent is Almighty Allah that He <br>himself graces a person with the power to do this virtuous <br>act, and then grants pardon on this basis to complete His <br>extreme favour. In this connection a story told about Hadh- <br>rat Atna (Rahmatullah alaih) is well known. He once hap- <br>pened to go to the market where a woman lunatic slave was <br>on sale. He purchased her. At midnight she got up, per- <br>formed her ablution. and began offering Salaat. During her <br>prayers she wept so profusely that her breath was getting <br>:<br>choked. Then she said: \"0 my Lord! in the name of the <br>love that You have for me, bestow Your Mercy on me.\" <br>Hearing this Ataa said \"0 slave woman say: '0Allah in<br><br>Ch.

Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, <br>\"0 Jibraa-eel! I am worried about my Ummat, as to how <br>they will (fare) on the Day of Judgement!\" \"Is it about the <br>non-believers or about the Muslims?\" asked Jibraa-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam). \"About the Muslims,\" replied the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Jibraa-eel (Alayhis <br>salaam) then took the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>along to a graveyard where the people of the tribe of Banu <br>Salama were buried; there he struck a grave with his wing<br><br>Ch. 11: AIi(~ditho n  Virl lies oJ'lic~limclh 'l'tryyc~l)c~h 123<br>39 <br>treatment. In Surah Faatir of the Holy Qur'an, three catego- <br>ries of this Ummat have been described; one category is <br>named al&bckL. <br>(leaders in virtues), about whom it is <br>stated in a hadith that they will enter Paradise without anv <br>reckoning. According to one hadith, a person who recites <br>AI y~ y one hundred times daily will on the Dav of Resur- <br>rection be raised up with his face shining like the full <br>moon. Madhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that those whose tongues remain busy in the zikr of Allah <br>will enter Paradise rejoicing. <br>Hadith No. 14<br><br>each register as long as one can see, will be opened <br>before him. He will then be asked if he denies anything <br>recorded in his account of deeds, or whether the angels <br>who were appointed to record his deeds had been <br>unjust to him in any respect. He will reply in the nega- <br>tive (i.e. he will neither deny anything nor blame the <br>angels for any injustice to him). Then Allah will ask <br>him if he can justify his misdeeds, but he will submit <br>that he has no excuse to offer. Then Allah will say <br>'Well, there is indeed one virtue to your credit. Today <br>no injustice will be done to you.' Then a small piece of <br>I<br>paper with the Kalimah <br>written on it will be handed over to him, and he will <br>be asked to go and get it weighed. He will subniit that <br>this small piece of paper will be of little avail as <br>against so many lengthy registers. Allah will say, \"This <br>day, no injustice will be done to you.\" Then all the <br>registers will be placed in one pan and the piece of<br><br>I<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"I swear <br>by Allah Who controls my life that if all the skies and <br>the Earth, with all the people and all the things be- <br>tween them and all that may be within them, are <br>I<br>placed together in one pan of the balance, and the faith <br>in& y! i!y, is put in the other pan, the latter will outw- <br>eigh the former.\" <br>This subject matter has been described in many aha- <br>dith. It admits of no doubt that nothing can be equal to the <br>blessed name of Allah. It is really a great misfortune and <br>deprivation for those who take it lighty. However, the <br>weight of this Kalimah is proportional to the Ikhlaas with <br>which it is uttered. The greater the Ikhlaas, the weightier <br>becomes the Kalimah. It is to cultivate this Ikhlaas that one <br>has to remain in the service of the Sufis. According to one <br>hadith, the above-mentioned saying of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was in connection with another sub- <br>ject matter. He has said: \"Persuade a dying person to recite <br>(81j!ii~$because he who recites this Kalimah at the time of <br>his death gets entitled to enter Paradise.\" The Sahaba en- <br>i<br>d \"0 R<br>l ll h! (S ll ll h<br>l ih<br>ll<br>)<br>h t<br><br>Cli. 11: Ali(~dithon Virtues of Kulimuh 'I'ayyabuh 127 <br>and to it I invite al!*manktnd.\" It was in this connection <br>that the verse LW Yi*;i,ji 4 [What thing is ob most weight <br>in testimony) was reve'aled.\" <br>Note: <br>The words of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>namely, \"I have been deputed (as a prophet) specifically <br>for the propagation of this Kalimah, and to it I invite all <br>mankind\" did not mean that only he had been sent on this <br>special mission. In fact, all the Prophets had been deputed <br>for the propagation of this Kalimah, and all of them had in- <br>vited mankind to it. From Aadam (Alayhis salaam) to Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) the last and the best of <br>Prophets, there was not a single prophet who had not <br>propagated this sublime Kalimah. So blessed and sublime <br>*I<br>is this Kalimah, that all the Prophets and all true religions <br>propagated it, and served its cause. In fact, every true relig- <br>4 <br>ion is based on this Kalimah. It is in support of this Kali- .EN <br>mah that the Qur'anic verse <br>(Y <br>cb~,,ijp$1 '2213 has <br>been revealed, in which Almighty Allah is a witness in <br>favour of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Accord- <br>ing to one hadith when somebody recites &+!&<br>then<br><br>far more than any other Ummat. There have been hundreds <br>of thousands. nay millions of Sufis (divine persons) every <br>one of whom had hundreds of disciples, all of whom re- <br>cited the Kalimah thousands of times daily as a matter of <br>routine. It is stated in the book 'Jaami-ul-Usool' that the <br>word 'Allah' should be repeated a minimum number of five <br>I <br>thousand times daily alid that there is no upper limit for <br>this, and the Sufis are required to repeat <br>yl j,y, dailv at <br>least twenty five thousand times. This number varies <br>ac:c:ording to the advice of the Mashaaikh. I have related all <br>this in support of the above saying of Hadhrat Eesa (Jesus) <br>stated in his book al-Qowlul jameel that his father as a be- <br>gill~ier in Sufism used to recite ( ~ I Y IJIY, two hundred times <br>in one breath. <br>(Alavhis salaam). Shah Waliullah (Kahmatullah alaih) has <br>Shaikh Abu Yazeed Qurtubi (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: <br>learning that one who recites ,81i1ii!J, seventy thou- <br>\"011 <br>salid times becomes safe from the fire of Hell. I completed <br>this number once for my wife and then several times for <br>my own self as a provision for the Hereafter. There used to <br>live near us a voung man who was known to be blessed<br><br>will come to Me with firm faith in (bYJi~<br>Y) will enter <br>My fort, and whosoever enters My fort will be safe <br>from My punishment.\" <br>Note: <br>If the abovementioned blessing is on the condition that <br>one does not commit major sins, as mentioned under <br>Hadith No 5,then there is no ambiguitv about it: but if reci-<br>tation of the Kalimah, in spite of major sins, is implied. <br>then the word 'punishment' implies eternal punishment. <br>However, Allah's Mercy knows no bounds. It is mentioned <br>in the Qur'an that Alrnighty Allah will not forgive the sin <br>of Shirk (polytheism), but will forgive any other sin, as he <br>may like. According to one hadith. Almighty Allah pun- <br>ishes o111v such persons who revolt agaillst him and refuse <br>to recite , i t  yl JI y, . According to another hadith, the recita- <br>tion of <br>( k Y 1JJ <br>removes the wrath of Almighty Allah. as <br>?<br>l<br>)<br> <br>long as one refrains from attaching more importance to the <br>worldly things as compared with the religion; but if one <br>starts preferring the former over the religion, then recita- <br>tion of (51JIj~y, proves of little use, because then Allah<br><br>I <br>C I i .  11: AIi(~tlilhon Virtues o /K(11i1nclh7'(1!*!ro!~(~h<br>131 <br>this superiority, according to the Sufis, is that zikr has a <br>special cleansing effect on the heart; by virtue of this zikr, <br>the heart gets purified of all its maladies and, if supple- <br>mented by Istighfaar, this becomes most effective. It is <br>stated in one hadith that when the fish had swallowed <br>Hadhrat Yunus (Alayhis salaam) he recited the prayer <br>and that whosoever supplicates Allah in these words will <br>be granted his prayer. This subject has also been mentioned <br>in Hadith No. 1 of this chapter, namelv that the best form <br>of supplicatiorl is stated to be <br>( 5 &I, . whereas here it is <br>stated to be Istighfaar. This apparent difference is accord-<br>ing to the differing circumstances. For a pious man. (<br>A<br>~<br>J<br>)$ <br>is the best form of supplication, whereas a sinner should <br>% a<br>do Taubah and Istighfaar, and for him Istighfaar is nat- =-i <br>~ r a l l y  the most suitable supplication. For increase of I~en- T <br>efits, praising and glorifying Allah is more effective, while <br>for relieving the evils and hardships, Istighfaar proves to be <br>more effective. There are also several other reasons for this<br><br>Note:-<br>The main object of Shavtaan is to inject poison into <br>one's mind, as stated under Hadith No. 14 in part 2 of <br>Chapter I, and he is successful in doing so only when the <br>heart is not engaged in zikr. otherwise he has to retreat in <br>disgrace. In fact, zikr of Allah purifies the heart. It is nar- <br>rated in Mishkaat that Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had said: \"For every thing there is a cleaner, and the <br>heart is cleansed by means of zikr of Almighty Allah.\" The <br>effect of Istighfaar is similar, as mentioned in many ahadith <br>that it removes the dust and rust from the heart, Abu Ali <br>Daqqaaq (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that when a person re- <br>cites +~ly,with sinceritv, his heart is cleansed of all dirt (as <br>a mirror is cleaned with a wet cloth), and when he says ,ksi,, <br>his heart shines with its light. It is clear that, under these <br>circumstances, the whole effort of Shaytaan is bound to go <br>waste. <br>Ruining through base desires, means that one may <br>begin to consider wrong as right, and give reiigious sanctity <br>to whatever he desires. This practice has been condemned <br>in the Holv Qur'an at several places At one place it is said:<br><br>t i .  1 :  t <br>1 <br>i <br>1 o <br>' i l l ~ l t s( 1  i<br>1<br>1 ' <br>I <br>I <br>irreligious deed as a religious one, so that one does it as an <br>article of faith and hopes to get reward for it. As the person <br>performs it as a religious act, there is no likelihood of his <br>doing Taubah. If somebody is habituated to obvious sins, <br>like adultery and theft, there is a possibility that he may do <br>Taubah and give them up, but if somebody is doing a <br>wrong thing under the impression that it is religious duty, <br>the question of his doing Taubah does not arise. Rather, he <br>will get more involved in it day by day. This explains the <br>words of the Shaytaan: \"I involved them in sins, but they <br>frustrated my efforts through zikr, Taubah, and Istighfaar: <br>thereu~on 1 entrapped them in such a manner that their <br>escape became impossible.\" <br>'I'hus, it is essential that in all matters of religion, guid- <br>ance be sought frorn the ways of life of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and of his Companions (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum). Doing otherwise is devoid of virtue, and will <br>entail sins. <br>lrnam Ghazali (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported from <br>Hasan Basri. (Rahmatullah alaih) a narrative that Shaytaan <br>says: \"I presented sinful deeds in an attactive form to the<br><br>is.&C@~jd@JjlydjJ JUI& i<br>~<br>U<br>~<br>~<br>i<br>~<br>k<br>~<br>4 <br>diplrj. : <br>L J & J , , ~ , , ~ ; L I & W ; ~ ~ Y ~ J ~ Y<br>~ l i ~ q c .

A small deed done <br>with Ikhlaas (sincerity) earns a great reward: but anything <br>done for the sake of mere show or to please some people, <br>will 'earn no good reward, but punishment from Almighty <br>Allah. That is why a person who recites the Kalimah with <br>sincerity of heart will certainly be pardoned and admitted <br>into Paradise.

After her burial according to her wishes, the <br>maid-servant saw her in a dream wearing a very beautiful <br>dress. When asked what happened to her old woolen dress, <br>she replied that it had been deposited with her deeds. The <br>maid servant requested her for some advice, and she re- <br>plied: \"Do zikr of Almighty Allah as much as you can; by <br>virtue of this you will be worthy of envy in the grave.\"<br><br>sword in his hand and proclaimed: \"I will chop off the <br>head of whosoever.says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is dead. He has only gone to meet his Allah, as <br>Hadhrat Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone on Mount <br>Toor.\" Some of the Sahabas feared that the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) meant the end of <br>Islam, some thought that there was no longer any chance <br>for the progress of Islam, whereas some were dumb-<br>founded and could not even speak. It was only Hadhrat <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) who, in spite of his extreme <br>love and attachment with Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), remained firm, calm, and collected. He got up and <br>delivered his forceful address, beginning with the verse <br>j i <br>j <br>, which means \"Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is but a messenger; many messengers <br>have passed away before him. Will it be that when he dieth <br>or is slain, ye will turn back on your heels? He who turneth <br>back doth no harm to Allah, but Allah will reward the duti- <br>ful.\" This story has been briefly related by me in my book <br>Stories of Sahabah. <br>Another point made in the above mentioned hadith is<br><br>Ch. 11: Ahudith on Virtues of Kalirnah Tuyyubah <br>141 <br>Hadith No.27 <br>-<br>+Y j\\<br>\\sjy w $1 d,+3 w $1 dJ3 b  irb Ti1 epb &I + a,i5 <br>1-b JIiJ >I f! i!J ,UI &G $1 4./r YI US <br>JI <br>4 3 L+ Uj.21 icl( <br>'-+& 3 i+L: J(3 Wi &G, <br>,<br>0 <br>8 2<br>gr;j<br>Hadhrat , Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>5 <br>that he had heard Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"I know of a Kalimah which, if-recited by <br>a person with sincerity of heart fobids the fire of Hell<br><br>1<br>ected few should have in their mind thoughts of nothing <br>else except Almighty Allah. He also stated that it was for <br>this reason that this blessed name is mentioned so many <br>times, in fact two thousand three hundred and sixty times, <br>in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Shaikh Ismail Farghaani (Rahmatullah alaih) relates: \"1 <br>had, for a long time, a keen desire to learn this Ismul- <br>A'zam, and for this purpose I had undergone great hard- <br>ships: I would fast for days together, so much that some- <br>times I would fdll senseless on account of severe hunger. <br>One day, I was sitting in a mosque in Damascus, when two <br>men entered there and stood besides me. To me they <br>looked like angels.

Abul Abbaas related: \"I was lying sick <br>in the town of Ashbila. I saw a large flock of huge birds of <br>different colours, white, red, green, etc., which were <br>spreading their wings all together and there were many <br>men who were carrying something in big covered trays. I <br>took them as gifts of death, and started reciting the Kalimah <br>Tayyibah hurriedly. Then one of those men said to me that <br>the time of my death had not yet come, and that this was a <br>gift for another believer.\" <br>Just before his death, Hadhrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) asked those around him to make him <br>sit up. After they did so, he said: \"0Allah! You ordered <br>me to do many things, which I could not do, and You for- <br>bade me certain things, but I disobeyed you in them.\" He <br>repeated these words thrice. and then after reciting <br>i J!iij)b<br>t<br>t<br>i<br>di<br>ti<br>S<br>b d<br>k d<br><br>+ <br>152 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>. <br>I <br># <br>,,+;,<br>+ <br>&<br>@i<br>+LA\\<br>bb<br>~i <br>4, <br>ai yj LWIdI-, <br>-1 <br>bL-c?J~ <br>j+I,<br>+)>,. <br>;,I ki-7 <br>>I\" 4 241JU ,.+. <br>( 1 ~  <br>3 LL <br>& ~UI,<br>c k 9 ~<br>~b <br>&I JIJi <br>+?I,<br>21<br>LJI <br>, y & I  3 <br>b ( j J  <br>41c gb -2 <br>Js <br>J\\iJ ;rz. jlc. &Ul JLrJ <br>U L d p J , *  <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) sub- <br>mitted: \"0, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>favour me with some advice.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: \"When you happen to commit a <br>sin, hasten to do a virtue in atonement, so that the ill <br>effect of the sin may be washed away.\" Abu Zar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) then further enquired: \"0 Rasulullah! <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is recitation of 41u'! A!Y, <br>also a virtue?\" \"It is the best of all virtues,\" was the <br>reply of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Note: <br>A minor sin, no doubt, is washed away by a virtuoys <br>deed, but a major one is wiped off, as a rule, through <br>T<br>b h<br>f<br>h<br>h h<br>M<br>f Al<br>i h<br>All h<br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>every tree, so that there are many witnesses in your favour <br>on the Day of Judgement: and if you happen to commit a <br>sin, do some virtue immediately in atonement thereof, so <br>that if the sin is committed in secret the virtue should also <br>be done in secret, and if the sin is committed openly the <br>virtue should also be done openly.\" <br>Hadith No 34 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"Whosoever recites the following ten times will be re- <br>warded with forty thousand virtues\":<br><br>It is said in another hadith: \"Whoever recites: <br>two million virtues will be written to his credit. <br>Note: <br>How great is the kindness and benevolence of <br>Almighty Allah, that He bestows thousands and millions of <br>virtues for the mere recitation of this Kalimah, which <br>action does not involve hard labour or much time; but, un- <br>fortunately we are negligent and remain so much absorbed <br>in our wordly pursuits that we never care to take advantage <br>of these bounties. Almighty Allah grants at least ten times <br>reward for every virtue, provided it is done with Ikhlaas, <br>and then this reward multiplies further according to the <br>degree of sincerity. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said: \"When a person embraced Islam, all his previous <br>sins are forgiven, and then every virtue is rewarded ten to <br>seven hundred times, and even more than that as Almighty <br>1<br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on,Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>is committed to Shirk at the time of his death; of the two <br>kinds of deeds which bring equivlrlent rewards, one is to <br>make firm intention for a virtuous deed (before its actual <br>performance), and the other is to commit a sin which is <br>also recorded as one only. The fifth is to do a noble deed, <br>the reward for which is ten times, while the sixth is to <br>spend wealth in the path of Allah, in which case the <br>reward is enhanced seven hundred times. <br>Of the four categories of people, the first is of those <br>who enjoy prosperity in this world but will face adversity <br>in the Hereafter, the second is of those who face adversity <br>in this world but will enjoy prosperity in the Hereafter; the <br>people in the third category face adversity in both the <br>worlds i.e. they are poor in this life and will be punished <br>'S<br>in the Hereafter, and the fourth category includes those <br>who are well off in both the worlds. <br>34<br>r* <br>A person came to Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho <br>5 <br>anho) and asked him if he had narrated that Almighty <br>Allah multiplies the reward of some virtues one million <br>times. He swore in confirmation that he had heard it <br>tl<br>lik<br>th t<br>A<br>di<br>t<br>th<br>i<br>h<br>h d<br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 157 <br>that the pious people who are used to reciting this Kalimah <br>excessively have a sort of brightness over their faces, even <br>during their earthly life. <br>Hadith No. 38<br><br>Note: <br>The best way to persuade a dying man to recite the Ka- <br>limah is that those sitting near him should recite it, so that <br>on hearing it he may also do the same. He should not be <br>compelled to do it, because he is dying in agony. That a <br>dying person should be persuaded to recite the Kalimah <br>has been stressed in many ahaadith. In several ahaadith, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said, \"The sins of a person who is blessed to recite the Ka- <br>limah at the time of death are washed off just as a building <br>is washed away by flood water.\" According to other ahaa- <br>dith, one who recites this blessed Kalimah before his death <br>gets all his past sins forgiven. It is said in one hadith that a <br>hypocrite is never able to recite it (at the time of hjs death). <br>It is said in another hadith that we should give ~ & I Y ! ~ I Y ,as <br>provision to our deceased ones. According to a hadith. <br>one who brings up a child till he is able to recite <br>5 <br>will not be required to render any account. In one hadith it <br>is said, \"When a person who has been steadfast in offer- <br>ing salaat is about to die, an Angel comes to him, drives <br>away the Satan and persuades him to recite the Kalimah <br>I<br><br>"

In such a dangerous and <br>ungodly atmosphere, the very existence of the Muslims in <br>the world is a great blessing of Allah, otherwise we are in- <br>viting ruination through all possible means. Hadhrat Aa- <br>ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) asked the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), \"When the punishment of Allah be- <br>falls the inhabitants of any locality, does it affect the pious, <br>just as it affects the guilty?\" The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) answered: \"Yes, it does affect all of them <br>in this world, but at the Resurrection the pious will be sep- <br>arated from the guilty.\" Therefore, those people who are <br>simply satisfied with their own piety, and do not partici- <br>pate in improving others should not rest assured that they <br>are safe from the punishment of the Almighty. If any chas- <br>tisement is inflicted by Allah, they too will be involved in <br>it. <br>1<br><br>CHAPTER 6 <br>RESPECT FOR LEARNING AND <br>THE LEARNED IN ISLAM <br>In this chapter, I would make a few submissions to the <br>Muslims in general that they may know how to respect the <br>scholars and the preachers of Islam. Today it is usual to <br>have unfounded misgivings and objections jigain>t.,Jhe <br>preachers and the learned men of the nation. this is very <br>harmful from the religious point of view. In every circle <br>and every institution of the world, there are good as well as <br>bad people; and if there are a few bad persons amongbthe <br>scholars also, it is no wonder. Two important consider- <br>ations are here noteworthy. Firstly. you should not form <br>any definite opinion about the character of anyone, unless <br>you have a solid proof about it. <br>Says Allah in the Holy Qur'an: <br>O<br>4<br> <br>.M1<br>CI<br><br>CHAPTER 7 <br>KEEPING COMPANY WITH THE RIGHTEOUS DIVINES <br>In this last chapter, which really completes the sixth <br>one, I would remind the Muslims to follow the Sunnah of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasalla'm), and to keep <br>the company of those who devote themselves to Islam and <br>remember Allah day and night, for this will make them <br>steadfast in Islam. Even the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) was commanded to keep such company; says <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)-on this sub- <br>ject: <br>\"Sh ll I t ll<br>thi<br>b<br>hi h<br>tt i<br>d<br>C0 9<br><br>\"0 son! Perform thy prayers regularly; and com- <br>mand people to do good deeds, and prevent them from <br>forbidden things, and bear patiently whatever befalls <br>you (in the preaching of Truth): undoubtedly this de- <br>mands courage! \" <br>(Surah Luqmaan: 17) <br>In this verse, several important things for a Muslim <br>have been mentioned, which can be a means for our salva- <br>tion; but we have neglected these very badly. Not to speak <br>of the lack of preaching the truth, we have neglected even <br>the prayers, which is a basic principle of Islam, in fact the <br>most important after faith. There are so many people who <br>do not perform their prayers at all; but even those who do, <br>hardly perform it with all its requisites, such as congrega- <br>tional prayers. It is the poor only who perform the prayers <br>with congregation in the mosque, while the rich feel it <br>below their dignity to be present in the mosque. Ah! my<br><br>"

In those times, the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) has advised us to mind our own <br>business and to worship Allah, rather than deliver sermons <br>to the people. But the divines of the nation say that such a <br>period has not yet come; therefore, try your best to reform <br>yourself and to instruct others, before such a time comes. <br>We must avoid those shortcomings pointed out by the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) above as these are the <br>doors through which will occur corruption in our personal <br>life as well as in the society. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has counted these shortcomings among the <br>causes of our destruction. <br>* <br>*I$, <br>* <br>I <br>3. <br>011<br><br>I <br>end of the verse. In fact, the real object in this verse is to <br>emphasise the importance of enjoining people to do good <br>deeds, and this is the distinguishing feature of the Muslim <br>Ummah. It is not sufficient to enjoin good and to prevent <br>from evil only now and then, but this practice should con- <br>tinue at all times and on all occasions regularly. Reference <br>to the task of preaching the truth are found in earlier relig- <br>ions, but the distinguishing merit of the Muslim Ummah <br>lies in taking it up as a regular assignment. This is not a <br>temporary work, but a permanent one. <br>\"In the talk of an assembly of common folk there <br>1 <br>is no good at all, except those who command people to <br>I <br>give charity (to the poor) or instruct them to do good <br>things, or make peace between people (they will be re- <br>warded by Allah). And whoever does this only to <br>please Allah, soon he will receive a great reward from <br>Allah \"<br>(SurahNisaa: 114)<br><br>"
