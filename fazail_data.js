The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br><br>0,<br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br><br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br><br>17 / <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br><br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br><br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse: <br>\"Lo! I, indeed I am Alfah. There is none worthy of <br>worship savz Me. So serve me and establish Salaat for <br>My remembrance.\" <br>He said: \"Alright, take me to Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came out from insidwand said: <br>\"0,'Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday (on Thurs- <br>day night) the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>prayed to Allah, '0,Allah strengthen Islam with either <br>'Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest'. It seems <br>that his prayer has been answered in your favour.\" <br>'Umar then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and embraced Islam on Friday morning. 'Umar's Islam <br>was a terrible blow to the morale of the unbelievers, but <br>still the Muslims were few in number and the whole coun- <br>try was against them. The disbelievers intensified ,their <br>efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims and the <br>extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on <br>their side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in <br><br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new, <br>and returned to their country. On approaching Mecca, they <br>learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions wen: <br>going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to <br>Abyssinia and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protec- <br>tion of a few inflyential people. This is known as the first <br>migration to Abyssinia. Later on, a bigger group of eighty- <br>three men and eighteen women emigrated to Abyssinia <br>(separately). This is called the second emigration to that <br>country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. <br>The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought <br>of peace enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They <br>sent a delegation to Abyssinia with handsome presents for <br>the king, his courtiers and the clergy. The delegation first <br>met the chiefs and the priests and, by offering them pres- <br>ents, succeeded in winning the court officials to their side. <br>Having thus made their way to the royal court, they pros- <br>trated themselves before the king and then presenting the <br>gifts put their case before him. They &id: <br>\"0,king! A few foolish lads of our community have re- <br>nounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an <br>absolutely new religion, which is opposed to'our as <br>well as your religions. They have come and-settled in <br>your country. The nobility of Mecca, their own parents <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they <br>could make to the charges brought against them. Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) rose and addressed the king thus: <br>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither <br>knew Allah nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped <br>stones. We used to eat carrion and commit all sorts of <br>undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did not make <br>good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among <br>us would thrive,at the expense of the weak. Till at last, <br>Allah raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>our reformation. His noble descent, up-right conduct, <br>integrity of purpose, and pure life are only too well <br>known amongst us. He called upon us to worship Al- <br>lah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone- <br>worship. He enjoined upon us right conduct, and for- <br>bade us from indecency. He taught us to tell the truth, <br>to make good our trust, to have regard for our kith and <br>kin, and to do good to our neighbours. From him we <br>learnt to observe Salaat. Fasting, Zakaat and good con- <br>duct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid blood- <br>shed. He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, <br>misappropriating the orphan's heritage, bringing false <br>accusations against others, and all other indecent <br>things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, the won- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\" <br>and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no <br>means hand over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed <br>and disgraced, they held a counsel. One of them said: <br>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's <br>wrath upon their heads.\" <br>Although the others did not agree to sukh a drastic step (for <br>after all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would <br>not listen. The next day, they excited the king by telling <br>him that those heretics denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) <br>and did not believe in his Divinity. The Muslims were <br>again summoned to the court. They were much more dis- <br>tressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief <br>in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam). they said: <br>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him to <br>our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a <br>servant and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which <br>He conveyed to the virgin and pure Maryam.\" <br>Negus said: \"'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does :not say <br>anything beyond that.\" <br>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king <br>would not listen to them. He returned to the de1t:gatioil the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness. <br>This is to meditate over the greatness of Allah. If this is <br>done, it becomes very easy- to perform all other acts of <br>righteousness with full sincerity. Is it so very difficult to <br>devote a few minutes, out of the twenty four hours of a day <br>at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation? <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passing <br>near the ruins of Thamud during Tabuk expedition: <br>The Tabuk expedition is one of the major campaigns of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and the last one <br>in which he personally took part. When he received the <br>news that the Caesar (of Rome) had mustered a large force <br>to crush the power of Islam and was on his way (through <br>Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah <br>to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 <br>A.H., the devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the <br>weather was hot and the fighting was expected to be very <br>tough. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made an <br>open declaration that the Muslims should gather in <br>strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman <br>Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the <br>equipment of the expedition. It was on this occasion that <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not even <br>dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on ac- <br>count of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. <br>Except the women, children (who were excusable), those <br>who were ordered to stay behind by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, nearly every- <br>body joined the expedition. Also among those left behind <br>were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for <br>themselves, nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) able to provide them with any. It is about such people <br>that Allah says in his Book: <br>\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in <br>sorrow that they could not find means to spend.\" <br>(IX:92) <br>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any <br>excuse whatsoever were three in number. Their story <br>would be presently related. On their way to Syria when the <br>expedition reached the habitat ion of Tharnud, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his face with his shirt <br>and quickened the pace of his camel. He also instructed the <br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying: <br>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" <br>Allah's reply to thie was: <br>(*\\ $9)I> bi *ju ji <br>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\" <br>From amongst the .f&thful, there were only three persons <br>who failed to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura- <br>rah bin Rabi, Hilal MR Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Rad- <br>hipallaho anhum). Murarah had orchards of dates, laden <br>with fruit. He pershaded himself to lag behind with the <br>piea: <br>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What <br>possible harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this <br>one?\" <br>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this <br>prevented him from going out. But when he realised his <br>folly, he gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, <br>too, that had caused him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's case was different. Some <br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>4 7<br>of his kinsfolk who had been away for a long time had just <br>returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their company <br>that he did not join the expedition. He also had partici- <br>pated in all the campaigns previously and thought (like <br>Murarah) that it would not matter much if he missed just <br>that one campaign. When he came to know of the serious- <br>ness of his default, he made up his mind to sever all his <br>connections with those relatives who had been the cause of <br>that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, <br>which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says: <br>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at the <br>time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had <br>never possessed this number before. It was a habit with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never <br>disclosed the destination of his expeditions, but he <br>would k e e ~  <br>enquiring about the conditions prevailing <br>elsewhere. But this time in view of the distance, the <br>hot season, and the strength of the enemy, he had de- <br>clared his destination, so that preparations could be <br>made thorough and complete. The number of the par- <br>ticipants was so large that it was difficult to note down <br>their names even, so much so, that absentees could <br>hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of <br>Madinah were full of fruit. I intended every morning to <br>make preparation for the journey but, somehow or <br>other, the days passed by and I made no progress. I <br>was satisfied that I had all the necessary means at my <br>disposal and that I would be ready in no time if I once <br>did decide to do so. I was still in this state of indeci- <br>sion when I learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho daihe <br>wasallam) had left with his companions. The idea still <br>lingered in my mind that I would take a day or two to <br>get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination <br>continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in <br>Tabuk drew very near. I then tried to get ready but <br>again, somehow or other, I did not do so. Now, when I <br>came to look at the people left behind, I realised that <br>there was none in Madinah except those who had been <br>condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially <br>exempted from going for certain reasons. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk in-<br>quired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' <br>Somebody said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in <br>wealth and ease has caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az <br>Stories of the ~ a h a a b a h  <br>interrupted and said, No, this is wrong. As far as our <br>knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's <br>return. I was struck with grief and remorse. Good ex- <br>cuses one after the other entered my mind, and I was <br>sure that I could escape the Prophet's wrath with one <br>of them for the time being, and later on I could pray for <br>forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice of the wise <br>men of my family in the matter. But when I knew that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had actually <br>arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth <br>would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain <br>truth. It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that whenever he returned from a journey <br>he would repair to the musjid, first of all, say two <br>rakaat 'Tahiyyatul musjid' and then stay there for a <br>while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in the <br>musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on <br>solemn oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany <br>him on the campaign. He took them at their words, <br>leaving the rest to Allah. Just then I came and greeted <br>him with 'salaam'. He turned his face with a sardonic <br>smile. I besought him with the words: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! You turn your face from me. By Allah! I am <br>neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my <br>faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. He then <br>said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had <br>you not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly <br>man, I am sure I would escape his displeasure through <br>(seemingly) reasonable excuses, for Allah has endowed <br>me with the gift of the gab. But in your case I am sure <br>that if 1 appease you with a false statement, Allah <br>would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, <br>I am sure that if I displease you by confessing the <br>simple truth, then Allah would very soon blow away <br>your displeasure. I, therefore, make bold to speak the <br>very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all. I had never <br>been so we11 to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking <br>the truth.' He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will <br>decide about you. When I left the musjid, many a man <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>of my clan blamed me and admonished me thus; <br>'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after <br>making some good excuse for once, you had requested <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pray for <br>your goodness, surely his prayer would have sufficed <br>you.' I inquired of them if there were any more people <br>like me. They informed me that there were two other <br>persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, <br>who also had admitted their faults like me and re-<br>ceived the same reply from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I knew that both of them were very <br>good Muslims and had participated in the campaign of <br>Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) issued <br>instructions that none was to speak with the three of <br>us.' <br>It is a cqmmon principle that displeasure is shbwn <br>where some attachment exists, and a reprimand is given <br>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incor- <br>rigible person would be a futile effort. <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho<br>alaihe wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted <br>us. Nobody was prepared to mix with or even speak to <br>us. It seemed as if I was living in a strange land alto- <br>gether. My own birth-place looked like a foreign local- <br>ity and my bosom friends behaved like strangers. 'The <br>earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur'an IX: <br>113)for me. The thing that worried me most was that, <br>if I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not lead my funeral prayer, <br>and if the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) died in <br>the meantime, I would be doomed for ever, with none <br>to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. The <br>other two companions of mine confined themselves to <br>their houses. I was the most daring of the three: I <br>would go to the market, and join the Jamaat for Salaat, <br>but nobody would talk to me. I would approach the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say 'Assa- <br>lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his <br>lips moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete <br>the Salaat by standing close to him, and I would look <br>at him from the corner of my eye to learn if he ever <br>cast a single glance at me. I noticed that when I was <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>made over a letter to me from the Christian King of <br>Ghassan. Thus it read: 'We have come to know that <br>your master has ill-treated you. Allah may not-keep <br>you in abasement and in disgrace. You had better come <br>to us. We shall extend all help to you.' When I read <br>this letter, I uttered \"Inna-lillahi-wa-Inna-ilaihi-raaji-<br>oon\" To Allah we belong and to Him is our return; and <br>said; 'So my state of affairs (had) reached such an ebb <br>that even the Kafirs were aspiring to draw me away <br>from Islam.' I codld not imagine a calamity worse than <br>that. I went and threw the letter into an oven. There- <br>after I presented myself to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and exclaimed: '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Your indifference towards me has lowered me to such <br>an extent that even the Kafirs are building up their <br>hopes over me.\" <br>When forty days had passed in this condition, a mess- <br>enger of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>brought me this mandate: 'Be separated from your <br>wife' I inquired, 'Am I to divorce her?' He replied: 'No, <br>only be separated.' A similar message was delivered to <br>my other two companions as well. I consequently said <br>to my wife: 'Go to your parents and wait till Allah de- <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>sitting on the roof of my house stricken with grief, and <br>the earth had 'straightened' for me and the life had <br>become dismal for me, I heard a crier's cry from over <br>the top of the mount Sula; 'Happy tidings to you, 0, <br>Kaab.' The moment I heard this, I fell prostrate on the <br>ground and tears of joy rolled down my cheeks, as I <br>understood that the ordeal was now over. In fact, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had announced <br>the Divine forgiveness for all three of us after the <br>Salaat that morning. At this, a person ran up the top of <br>the mountain and yelled out the cry that had reached <br>me. Thereafter, a rider came galloping to deliver the <br>same happy news to me. 1 gave away as a gift the <br>clothes, I was wearing, to the messenger of glad tid- <br>ings. I swear by Allah I had no other clothes in my pos- <br>session at that time. I dressed up by borrowing clothes <br>from some friend and went to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). As I entered the musjid, the people <br>in the audience of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ran to congratulate me. Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was the first to approach me. He shook my hand <br>with a warmth that I shall never forget. Thereafter I of-<br>fered my salutation to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I found his face beaming and radiant like <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives. <br>(2) \t Their devotion and obedience to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallabo alaihe wasallam). For full fifty days the <br>whole Muslim community, even their nearest and <br>dearest, would not speak to the three persons, in <br>obedience to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) orders. The three persons themselves went <br>most steadfastly through the ordeal imposed on <br>them. <br>I <br>(3) \t Their strong faith. Kaab was so much perturbed <br>when he received the letter from the Christian <br>King, exciting him against the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). His words and his action at that <br>time are a testimony to the strong faith in his <br>heart. <br>Let us search our hearts and see how much devotion <br>we have in them for the observance of the duties we owe to <br>Islam. Leaving aside Zakaat and Hajj, which involve the <br>sacrifice of money, take the case of Salaat alone, which is <br>the most important pillar of Islam after Imaan. How many <br>of us are particular about it?</p></div>"

He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me, you will see how I <br>treat you!' It then closes upon him so much that his <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other. As <br>many as seventy serpents are then set upon him, to <br>keep biting him till the Day of Resurrection. These ser- <br>pents are so venomous that if one of them happened to <br>spurt its venom upon the earth, not a single blade of <br>grass would ever grow.\" <br>After this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The grave is either a garden of Paradise or a pit of <br>Hell.\" <br>Fear of Allah is the basic and essential qualification of <br>a Muslim. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ad- <br>vised the believers to remember death, off and on, and to <br>keep the fear of Allah ever present in their hearts. <br>11. \tHadhrat Hanzlah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Pear of Nifaq: <br>Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) when he delivered a sermon. Our hearts <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I <br>have turned Munafiq, 0 Prophet of Allah!' He inquired <br>about the matter, and I repeated what I had said to Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Thereupon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'By Him Who con- <br>trols my life, if you could keep up for all times the <br>fervour aroused in you when you are with me, angels <br>would greet you in your walks and in your beds. But, <br>0,Hanzlah! This is rare! This is rare!\" <br>We have to attend to our personal and impersonal <br>worldly affairs, and therefore we cannot be contemplating <br>the Hereafter for all the twenty-four hours of the day. <br>According to what has been said by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), complete absorption in the Hereafter is <br>rare, and it should not be expected by all. It is only for the <br>angels to remain in the same state for ever. In case of men, <br>the state of their mind changes with circumstances and en- <br>vironments. But we can see from this story how anxious <br>the Sahabah were about the condition of their Imaan. Hanz- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) suspects Nifaq in himself wher, he <br>feels that the condition of his mind at home is not the same <br>as it is when he is with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse: <br>\"And when the heaven splitteth asunder and beco- <br>meth rosy like red hide\", <br>(LV: 37) <br>the hair of his body stood on end, and he was nearly <br>choked, with excessive weeping. He would cry and say: <br>\"Alas; what will happen to me on the day when even <br>the Heaven splitteth asunder. Woe is me!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alai-he-wasallam) said to him: <br>\"Your crying has made even the angels weep\". <br>Once an Ansari sat and wept after Tahajjud, saying: <br>\"I cry to Allah for protection from the fire of Hell\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have made the angels weep today\". <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>once weeping. His wife also began to weep on seeing him <br>in this condition. He enquired of her: <br>\"Why are you weeping?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse: <br>\"Every soul will taste of death\" <br>(111:185) <br>he began to repeat it again and again. He heard a voice from <br>a corner of the room saying: <br>\"How often are you going to repeat this verse? Your <br>recitation has already caused the death of four Jinns\". <br>It is reported about another Sheikh that (while reciting <br>the Qur'an) when he reached the verse: <br>\"Then are they returned unto Allah, their Lord, the <br>Just, is not His the Command?\" <br>(VI:62) <br>he gave out a cry, shivered and breathed his last. <br>There are many stories of this type. Fudhail, a famous <br>Sheikh, says: <br>\"Fear of Allah leads to everything that is good\". <br>Shibli, another Sheikh of high position, says: <br>\"Whenever I have felt Allah's fear in me, I have found <br>a fresh door of knowledge and wisdom opened for <br>me\". <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear <br>from the fear of Allah is safe from entrance into the fire <br>of Hell.\" <br>He also said: <br>\"When a Muslim shivers with the fear of Allah, his <br>sins fall away from him like the falling leaves of a <br>tree.\" <br>The dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"A person weeping with fear of Allah cannot go to Hell <br>until milk goes back into the teats (which is an im-<br>possibility)\". <br>Hadhrat Uqbah bin Amir (Radhiyallaho anho) once in- <br>quired of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"What is the way to salvation?\" <br>He replied: \"Hold your tongue, stay indoors and cry over <br>your sins.\" <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once inquired of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Is there anybody among your followers who will go to <br>Paradise without reckoning?\"</p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br><br>0,<br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br><br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br><br>17 / <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br><br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br><br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse: <br>\"Lo! I, indeed I am Alfah. There is none worthy of <br>worship savz Me. So serve me and establish Salaat for <br>My remembrance.\" <br>He said: \"Alright, take me to Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came out from insidwand said: <br>\"0,'Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday (on Thurs- <br>day night) the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>prayed to Allah, '0,Allah strengthen Islam with either <br>'Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest'. It seems <br>that his prayer has been answered in your favour.\" <br>'Umar then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and embraced Islam on Friday morning. 'Umar's Islam <br>was a terrible blow to the morale of the unbelievers, but <br>still the Muslims were few in number and the whole coun- <br>try was against them. The disbelievers intensified ,their <br>efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims and the <br>extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on <br>their side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in <br><br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new, <br>and returned to their country. On approaching Mecca, they <br>learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions wen: <br>going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to <br>Abyssinia and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protec- <br>tion of a few inflyential people. This is known as the first <br>migration to Abyssinia. Later on, a bigger group of eighty- <br>three men and eighteen women emigrated to Abyssinia <br>(separately). This is called the second emigration to that <br>country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. <br>The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought <br>of peace enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They <br>sent a delegation to Abyssinia with handsome presents for <br>the king, his courtiers and the clergy. The delegation first <br>met the chiefs and the priests and, by offering them pres- <br>ents, succeeded in winning the court officials to their side. <br>Having thus made their way to the royal court, they pros- <br>trated themselves before the king and then presenting the <br>gifts put their case before him. They &id: <br>\"0,king! A few foolish lads of our community have re- <br>nounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an <br>absolutely new religion, which is opposed to'our as <br>well as your religions. They have come and-settled in <br>your country. The nobility of Mecca, their own parents <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they <br>could make to the charges brought against them. Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) rose and addressed the king thus: <br>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither <br>knew Allah nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped <br>stones. We used to eat carrion and commit all sorts of <br>undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did not make <br>good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among <br>us would thrive,at the expense of the weak. Till at last, <br>Allah raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>our reformation. His noble descent, up-right conduct, <br>integrity of purpose, and pure life are only too well <br>known amongst us. He called upon us to worship Al- <br>lah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone- <br>worship. He enjoined upon us right conduct, and for- <br>bade us from indecency. He taught us to tell the truth, <br>to make good our trust, to have regard for our kith and <br>kin, and to do good to our neighbours. From him we <br>learnt to observe Salaat. Fasting, Zakaat and good con- <br>duct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid blood- <br>shed. He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, <br>misappropriating the orphan's heritage, bringing false <br>accusations against others, and all other indecent <br>things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, the won- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\" <br>and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no <br>means hand over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed <br>and disgraced, they held a counsel. One of them said: <br>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's <br>wrath upon their heads.\" <br>Although the others did not agree to sukh a drastic step (for <br>after all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would <br>not listen. The next day, they excited the king by telling <br>him that those heretics denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) <br>and did not believe in his Divinity. The Muslims were <br>again summoned to the court. They were much more dis- <br>tressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief <br>in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam). they said: <br>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him to <br>our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a <br>servant and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which <br>He conveyed to the virgin and pure Maryam.\" <br>Negus said: \"'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does :not say <br>anything beyond that.\" <br>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king <br>would not listen to them. He returned to the de1t:gatioil the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness. <br>This is to meditate over the greatness of Allah. If this is <br>done, it becomes very easy- to perform all other acts of <br>righteousness with full sincerity. Is it so very difficult to <br>devote a few minutes, out of the twenty four hours of a day <br>at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation? <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passing <br>near the ruins of Thamud during Tabuk expedition: <br>The Tabuk expedition is one of the major campaigns of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and the last one <br>in which he personally took part. When he received the <br>news that the Caesar (of Rome) had mustered a large force <br>to crush the power of Islam and was on his way (through <br>Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah <br>to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 <br>A.H., the devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the <br>weather was hot and the fighting was expected to be very <br>tough. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made an <br>open declaration that the Muslims should gather in <br>strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman <br>Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the <br>equipment of the expedition. It was on this occasion that <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not even <br>dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on ac- <br>count of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. <br>Except the women, children (who were excusable), those <br>who were ordered to stay behind by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, nearly every- <br>body joined the expedition. Also among those left behind <br>were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for <br>themselves, nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) able to provide them with any. It is about such people <br>that Allah says in his Book: <br>\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in <br>sorrow that they could not find means to spend.\" <br>(IX:92) <br>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any <br>excuse whatsoever were three in number. Their story <br>would be presently related. On their way to Syria when the <br>expedition reached the habitat ion of Tharnud, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his face with his shirt <br>and quickened the pace of his camel. He also instructed the <br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying: <br>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" <br>Allah's reply to thie was: <br>(*\\ $9)I> bi *ju ji <br>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\" <br>From amongst the .f&thful, there were only three persons <br>who failed to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura- <br>rah bin Rabi, Hilal MR Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Rad- <br>hipallaho anhum). Murarah had orchards of dates, laden <br>with fruit. He pershaded himself to lag behind with the <br>piea: <br>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What <br>possible harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this <br>one?\" <br>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this <br>prevented him from going out. But when he realised his <br>folly, he gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, <br>too, that had caused him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's case was different. Some <br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>4 7<br>of his kinsfolk who had been away for a long time had just <br>returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their company <br>that he did not join the expedition. He also had partici- <br>pated in all the campaigns previously and thought (like <br>Murarah) that it would not matter much if he missed just <br>that one campaign. When he came to know of the serious- <br>ness of his default, he made up his mind to sever all his <br>connections with those relatives who had been the cause of <br>that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, <br>which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says: <br>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at the <br>time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had <br>never possessed this number before. It was a habit with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never <br>disclosed the destination of his expeditions, but he <br>would k e e ~  <br>enquiring about the conditions prevailing <br>elsewhere. But this time in view of the distance, the <br>hot season, and the strength of the enemy, he had de- <br>clared his destination, so that preparations could be <br>made thorough and complete. The number of the par- <br>ticipants was so large that it was difficult to note down <br>their names even, so much so, that absentees could <br>hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of <br>Madinah were full of fruit. I intended every morning to <br>make preparation for the journey but, somehow or <br>other, the days passed by and I made no progress. I <br>was satisfied that I had all the necessary means at my <br>disposal and that I would be ready in no time if I once <br>did decide to do so. I was still in this state of indeci- <br>sion when I learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho daihe <br>wasallam) had left with his companions. The idea still <br>lingered in my mind that I would take a day or two to <br>get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination <br>continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in <br>Tabuk drew very near. I then tried to get ready but <br>again, somehow or other, I did not do so. Now, when I <br>came to look at the people left behind, I realised that <br>there was none in Madinah except those who had been <br>condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially <br>exempted from going for certain reasons. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk in-<br>quired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' <br>Somebody said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in <br>wealth and ease has caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az <br>Stories of the ~ a h a a b a h  <br>interrupted and said, No, this is wrong. As far as our <br>knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's <br>return. I was struck with grief and remorse. Good ex- <br>cuses one after the other entered my mind, and I was <br>sure that I could escape the Prophet's wrath with one <br>of them for the time being, and later on I could pray for <br>forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice of the wise <br>men of my family in the matter. But when I knew that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had actually <br>arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth <br>would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain <br>truth. It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that whenever he returned from a journey <br>he would repair to the musjid, first of all, say two <br>rakaat 'Tahiyyatul musjid' and then stay there for a <br>while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in the <br>musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on <br>solemn oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany <br>him on the campaign. He took them at their words, <br>leaving the rest to Allah. Just then I came and greeted <br>him with 'salaam'. He turned his face with a sardonic <br>smile. I besought him with the words: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! You turn your face from me. By Allah! I am <br>neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my <br>faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. He then <br>said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had <br>you not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly <br>man, I am sure I would escape his displeasure through <br>(seemingly) reasonable excuses, for Allah has endowed <br>me with the gift of the gab. But in your case I am sure <br>that if 1 appease you with a false statement, Allah <br>would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, <br>I am sure that if I displease you by confessing the <br>simple truth, then Allah would very soon blow away <br>your displeasure. I, therefore, make bold to speak the <br>very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all. I had never <br>been so we11 to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking <br>the truth.' He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will <br>decide about you. When I left the musjid, many a man <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>of my clan blamed me and admonished me thus; <br>'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after <br>making some good excuse for once, you had requested <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pray for <br>your goodness, surely his prayer would have sufficed <br>you.' I inquired of them if there were any more people <br>like me. They informed me that there were two other <br>persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, <br>who also had admitted their faults like me and re-<br>ceived the same reply from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I knew that both of them were very <br>good Muslims and had participated in the campaign of <br>Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) issued <br>instructions that none was to speak with the three of <br>us.' <br>It is a cqmmon principle that displeasure is shbwn <br>where some attachment exists, and a reprimand is given <br>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incor- <br>rigible person would be a futile effort. <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho<br>alaihe wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted <br>us. Nobody was prepared to mix with or even speak to <br>us. It seemed as if I was living in a strange land alto- <br>gether. My own birth-place looked like a foreign local- <br>ity and my bosom friends behaved like strangers. 'The <br>earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur'an IX: <br>113)for me. The thing that worried me most was that, <br>if I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not lead my funeral prayer, <br>and if the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) died in <br>the meantime, I would be doomed for ever, with none <br>to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. The <br>other two companions of mine confined themselves to <br>their houses. I was the most daring of the three: I <br>would go to the market, and join the Jamaat for Salaat, <br>but nobody would talk to me. I would approach the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say 'Assa- <br>lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his <br>lips moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete <br>the Salaat by standing close to him, and I would look <br>at him from the corner of my eye to learn if he ever <br>cast a single glance at me. I noticed that when I was <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>made over a letter to me from the Christian King of <br>Ghassan. Thus it read: 'We have come to know that <br>your master has ill-treated you. Allah may not-keep <br>you in abasement and in disgrace. You had better come <br>to us. We shall extend all help to you.' When I read <br>this letter, I uttered \"Inna-lillahi-wa-Inna-ilaihi-raaji-<br>oon\" To Allah we belong and to Him is our return; and <br>said; 'So my state of affairs (had) reached such an ebb <br>that even the Kafirs were aspiring to draw me away <br>from Islam.' I codld not imagine a calamity worse than <br>that. I went and threw the letter into an oven. There- <br>after I presented myself to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and exclaimed: '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Your indifference towards me has lowered me to such <br>an extent that even the Kafirs are building up their <br>hopes over me.\" <br>When forty days had passed in this condition, a mess- <br>enger of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>brought me this mandate: 'Be separated from your <br>wife' I inquired, 'Am I to divorce her?' He replied: 'No, <br>only be separated.' A similar message was delivered to <br>my other two companions as well. I consequently said <br>to my wife: 'Go to your parents and wait till Allah de- <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>sitting on the roof of my house stricken with grief, and <br>the earth had 'straightened' for me and the life had <br>become dismal for me, I heard a crier's cry from over <br>the top of the mount Sula; 'Happy tidings to you, 0, <br>Kaab.' The moment I heard this, I fell prostrate on the <br>ground and tears of joy rolled down my cheeks, as I <br>understood that the ordeal was now over. In fact, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had announced <br>the Divine forgiveness for all three of us after the <br>Salaat that morning. At this, a person ran up the top of <br>the mountain and yelled out the cry that had reached <br>me. Thereafter, a rider came galloping to deliver the <br>same happy news to me. 1 gave away as a gift the <br>clothes, I was wearing, to the messenger of glad tid- <br>ings. I swear by Allah I had no other clothes in my pos- <br>session at that time. I dressed up by borrowing clothes <br>from some friend and went to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). As I entered the musjid, the people <br>in the audience of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ran to congratulate me. Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was the first to approach me. He shook my hand <br>with a warmth that I shall never forget. Thereafter I of-<br>fered my salutation to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I found his face beaming and radiant like <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives. <br>(2) \t Their devotion and obedience to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallabo alaihe wasallam). For full fifty days the <br>whole Muslim community, even their nearest and <br>dearest, would not speak to the three persons, in <br>obedience to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) orders. The three persons themselves went <br>most steadfastly through the ordeal imposed on <br>them. <br>I <br>(3) \t Their strong faith. Kaab was so much perturbed <br>when he received the letter from the Christian <br>King, exciting him against the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). His words and his action at that <br>time are a testimony to the strong faith in his <br>heart. <br>Let us search our hearts and see how much devotion <br>we have in them for the observance of the duties we owe to <br>Islam. Leaving aside Zakaat and Hajj, which involve the <br>sacrifice of money, take the case of Salaat alone, which is <br>the most important pillar of Islam after Imaan. How many <br>of us are particular about it? <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me, you will see how I <br>treat you!' It then closes upon him so much that his <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other. As <br>many as seventy serpents are then set upon him, to <br>keep biting him till the Day of Resurrection. These ser- <br>pents are so venomous that if one of them happened to <br>spurt its venom upon the earth, not a single blade of <br>grass would ever grow.\" <br>After this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The grave is either a garden of Paradise or a pit of <br>Hell.\" <br>Fear of Allah is the basic and essential qualification of <br>a Muslim. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ad- <br>vised the believers to remember death, off and on, and to <br>keep the fear of Allah ever present in their hearts. <br>11. \tHadhrat Hanzlah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Pear of Nifaq: <br>Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) when he delivered a sermon. Our hearts <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I <br>have turned Munafiq, 0 Prophet of Allah!' He inquired <br>about the matter, and I repeated what I had said to Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Thereupon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'By Him Who con- <br>trols my life, if you could keep up for all times the <br>fervour aroused in you when you are with me, angels <br>would greet you in your walks and in your beds. But, <br>0,Hanzlah! This is rare! This is rare!\" <br>We have to attend to our personal and impersonal <br>worldly affairs, and therefore we cannot be contemplating <br>the Hereafter for all the twenty-four hours of the day. <br>According to what has been said by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), complete absorption in the Hereafter is <br>rare, and it should not be expected by all. It is only for the <br>angels to remain in the same state for ever. In case of men, <br>the state of their mind changes with circumstances and en- <br>vironments. But we can see from this story how anxious <br>the Sahabah were about the condition of their Imaan. Hanz- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) suspects Nifaq in himself wher, he <br>feels that the condition of his mind at home is not the same <br>as it is when he is with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse: <br>\"And when the heaven splitteth asunder and beco- <br>meth rosy like red hide\", <br>(LV: 37) <br>the hair of his body stood on end, and he was nearly <br>choked, with excessive weeping. He would cry and say: <br>\"Alas; what will happen to me on the day when even <br>the Heaven splitteth asunder. Woe is me!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alai-he-wasallam) said to him: <br>\"Your crying has made even the angels weep\". <br>Once an Ansari sat and wept after Tahajjud, saying: <br>\"I cry to Allah for protection from the fire of Hell\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have made the angels weep today\". <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>once weeping. His wife also began to weep on seeing him <br>in this condition. He enquired of her: <br>\"Why are you weeping?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse: <br>\"Every soul will taste of death\" <br>(111:185) <br>he began to repeat it again and again. He heard a voice from <br>a corner of the room saying: <br>\"How often are you going to repeat this verse? Your <br>recitation has already caused the death of four Jinns\". <br>It is reported about another Sheikh that (while reciting <br>the Qur'an) when he reached the verse: <br>\"Then are they returned unto Allah, their Lord, the <br>Just, is not His the Command?\" <br>(VI:62) <br>he gave out a cry, shivered and breathed his last. <br>There are many stories of this type. Fudhail, a famous <br>Sheikh, says: <br>\"Fear of Allah leads to everything that is good\". <br>Shibli, another Sheikh of high position, says: <br>\"Whenever I have felt Allah's fear in me, I have found <br>a fresh door of knowledge and wisdom opened for <br>me\". <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear <br>from the fear of Allah is safe from entrance into the fire <br>of Hell.\" <br>He also said: <br>\"When a Muslim shivers with the fear of Allah, his <br>sins fall away from him like the falling leaves of a <br>tree.\" <br>The dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"A person weeping with fear of Allah cannot go to Hell <br>until milk goes back into the teats (which is an im-<br>possibility)\". <br>Hadhrat Uqbah bin Amir (Radhiyallaho anho) once in- <br>quired of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"What is the way to salvation?\" <br>He replied: \"Hold your tongue, stay indoors and cry over <br>your sins.\" <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once inquired of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Is there anybody among your followers who will go to <br>Paradise without reckoning?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that, when he wept, he smeared his tears over <br>his face and beard saying: <br>\"I have heard that the fire of Hell does not touch the <br>place touched by these tears.\" <br>Thabit Banani was suffering from a disease of the eyes. <br>His doctor said to him: <br>\"Your eyes would be all right, provided you do not <br>weep in future.\" <br>He replied: \"What is the good of an eye if it cannot shed <br>tears.\" <br>Yazid bin Maisarah (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>'There can be seven reasons for weeping viz., extreme <br>joy, insanity, extreme pain, horror, artifice, intoxica- <br>tion and fear of Allah. A single tear shed in the fear of <br>Allah is sufficient to quench oceans of fire (of Hell).\" <br>Hadhrat Ka'ab Ahbar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I <br>\"By Him who holds my life in His (hands), I love to <br>weep for fear of Allah, with tears flowing down my <br>cheeks, rather than spend a mountain of gold in <br>charity\" <br><br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>59 3= <br>Cl a <br>There are numerous other sayings of the Saints and <br>'E;i<br>other pious people, indicating that weeping because of the <br>3,<br>rm<br>fear of Allah, and over one's sins, is very effective and ben- <br>eficial in attaining spiritual elevation. We should not, how- <br>ever, lose hope in Allah. His Mercy is all-embracing. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal!aho anho) says: <br>\"If it be announced on the Day of Judgement that all <br>except one individual shall go to Hell, my expectation <br>of the Mercy of Allah would make me hope that I may <br>be that chosen one. Again, if it be announced on that <br>day that all except one individual shall go to Paradise, <br>then my sins would make me fear that I may be that <br>condemned one.\" <br>It is therefore necessary that we should combine fear and <br>hope together in our hearts. Especially when the time of <br>death is apprdaching, we should have more hope than fear. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"None of you should die, except with a strong hope in <br>the Mercy of Allah.\" <br>When Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Radhiyallaho anho) ap- <br>proached his end, he sent for his son and asked him to read <br>to him the Ahaadith that induce hope in Allah and His <br>Mercy.</p></div>"

He said: <br>\"Abstinence is an asset of a Mo'min.\" <br>1. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Dislike <br>for gold: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"My Lord offered to turn the mounts of Mecca into <br>gold for me. But my supplication to Him was; '0, <br>Allah! I like to eat one day and feel hungry the next, so <br>that I may cry before Thee and remember Thee when I <br>am hungry; and be grateful to Thee and glorify Thee <br>when my hunger is gone!\" <br>Thus said our Prophet '(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>We profess to follow him and are proud of being in the fold <br>of his Ummat. Isn't. it incumbent upon us to follow him in <br>practice also? <br>2. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Life of <br>Abstinence: <br>Once, the prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided to stay away from his wives for one month, as he was <br>displeased with them on some account. He lived for that <br>one month in a separate room in the upper storey. A <br>rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>divorced his wives got afloat among the Sahabah. When 'U <br>mar heard of this, he came running to the musjid and <br>found the Sahabah sitting in groups, struck with grief over <br>the Prophet's suffering. He went to his daughter Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), who was a wife of the Prophet, and <br>found her weeping in her room. He said to her: <br>\"Why are you weeping now? Have I not been warning <br>you all these .times to refrain from any act likely to <br>cause the Prophet's displeasure'?\" <br><br>Ch. 111:Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 61 <br>He returned to the musjid and found some of the Sahabah <br>sitting near the pulpit and weeping. He sat there for some <br>time, but could not sit for long due to his excessive grief. <br>He went towards the room where the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was staying. He found Rabah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave, sitting on the steps. He asked him to go <br>and inquire of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>he could allow 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to see him. <br>Rabah went inside and came back to inform him that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held his peace and <br>said nothing. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>musjid and sat near the pulpit. Again the anguish eating <br>his heart would not allow him any rest, and he requested <br>Rabah to convey his request to the Prophet a second time. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did not make any <br>answer this time too. After tarrying near the pulpit for <br>some time more, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) craved per- <br>mission to see the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the third time. This time, his request was acceded to. When <br>he was ushered in, he saw the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) lying on a date leaf matting. The crossed pattern <br>of the matting could easily be seen imprinted on his hand- <br>some body. He had a leather bag filled with the bark of the <br>datepalm as his pillow. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I greeted him with Assalamo alaikum and inquired: <br>'Have you divorced your wives, 0,Prophet of Allah?\" <br>He answered in the negative. Much relieved, then I <br>made bold to remark, a bit amusingly; '0, Prophet of <br>Allah! we the Qureysh have always been having the <br>upper hand over our women, but in case of the Ansar <br>of Madinah, it is the women who have the upper hand. <br>Our women have also got influenced by the women <br>over here'. I said a few more similar things which <br>made him smile. I noticed that the contents of his <br>room consisted of only three pieces of tanned skin and <br>a handful of barley lying in a corner. I looked about, <br>but I failed to find anything else. I began to weep. He <br>said; 'Why are you weeping?' I replied: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! why should I not weep? I can see the mat's pat- <br>tern imprinted on your body, and I am also beholding <br>all that you have got in this room. 0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Pray that Allah may grant ample provisions for us. The <br>Persians and the Romans who have no true faith and <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter? Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next. I implored him: '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! Ask forgiveness for me. I was really <br>in the wrong\" <br>Look at the household effects of the sovereign in this <br>world and in the hereafter, and the beloved Prophet of <br>Allah. See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>\"It consisted of a skin filled with the bark of date- <br>palm.\" <br>The same question was put to Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha); <br>she said: <br>\"It consisted of a piece of canvas, which I spread <br>doublefolded under him. Once I laid it fourfold in an <br>effort to make it more comfortable. The next morning <br>he asked me: 'What did you spread under me last <br>night?' I replied! 'The same canvas, but I had four- <br>folded it instead of the customary double fold.' He <br>said: 'Keep it as it was before. The additional softness <br>stands in the way of getting up for Tahajjud.\"' <br>Now let us look around and survey the furniture of our <br>bedrooms. We, who live in so much comfort, never hesitate <br>to complain of hard times, instead of being grateful and <br>more obedient to Allah for his bounties. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) in a State <br>of Hunger <br>. <br>Once, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) after <br>wiping his nose with piece of fine linen remarked to him- <br>self: <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>during the night; his wife and his servant taking turns with <br>him in the prayers. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (~adhiyallaho anho) Daily Al- <br>lowance from the Bait-ul Ma1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was a cloth <br>merchant and lived by that trade. On the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), people selected him <br>as the Khalifah. Next day with some cloth slung on his <br>arms, he was proceeding to the market as usual when <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) met him in the way. <br>'Urnar: <br>\"Where are you going to, Abu Bakr?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"To the market\". <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"If you get busy with your trade, who will <br>carry out the duties of the caliphate?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t \"How am I to feed my family then?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Let's go to Abu 'Ubaidah (In charge of\"Bait-ul- <br>Mal), who will fix some daily allowance for <br>you from the 13ait-ul-Mal.\" <br>They both went to Abu 'Ubaidah (Kadhiyallaho anho). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"When Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was selected as <br>Khalifah. he said to the people: 'You well know that I <br>live bv trade, and my income therefrom is sufficient to <br>meet mv expenses. Now I have to devote my full time <br>to the affairs of the state and therefore my family al- <br>lowance shall be paid from the 'Bait-ul-Mal.'\" <br>~ a d h r a tA'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"At the time of his death, Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) directed rjle to hand over to his successor all that <br>was issued to him from the Bait-ul-Mal for his house- <br>hold needs. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>left no cash after him. Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: <br>\"Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) left a milch she-camel, <br>a bowl and a servant.\" <br>A(;c;ording to some other narrators. he left a bedding also. <br>When all these were made over to 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), his successor, he remarked: <br>\"Mav Allah be merciful to Abu Bakr! He has set a pre-<br>cedent for his successors which is very hard t o  <br>follow.\"</p></div>"

He lived for that <br>one month in a separate room in the upper storey. A <br>rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>divorced his wives got afloat among the Sahabah. When 'U <br>mar heard of this, he came running to the musjid and <br>found the Sahabah sitting in groups, struck with grief over <br>the Prophet's suffering. He went to his daughter Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), who was a wife of the Prophet, and <br>found her weeping in her room. He said to her: <br>\"Why are you weeping now? Have I not been warning <br>you all these .times to refrain from any act likely to <br>cause the Prophet's displeasure'?\" <br><br>Ch. 111:Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 61 <br>He returned to the musjid and found some of the Sahabah <br>sitting near the pulpit and weeping. He sat there for some <br>time, but could not sit for long due to his excessive grief. <br>He went towards the room where the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was staying. He found Rabah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave, sitting on the steps. He asked him to go <br>and inquire of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>he could allow 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to see him. <br>Rabah went inside and came back to inform him that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held his peace and <br>said nothing. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>musjid and sat near the pulpit. Again the anguish eating <br>his heart would not allow him any rest, and he requested <br>Rabah to convey his request to the Prophet a second time. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did not make any <br>answer this time too. After tarrying near the pulpit for <br>some time more, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) craved per- <br>mission to see the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the third time. This time, his request was acceded to. When <br>he was ushered in, he saw the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) lying on a date leaf matting. The crossed pattern <br>of the matting could easily be seen imprinted on his hand- <br>some body. He had a leather bag filled with the bark of the <br>datepalm as his pillow. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I greeted him with Assalamo alaikum and inquired: <br>'Have you divorced your wives, 0,Prophet of Allah?\" <br>He answered in the negative. Much relieved, then I <br>made bold to remark, a bit amusingly; '0, Prophet of <br>Allah! we the Qureysh have always been having the <br>upper hand over our women, but in case of the Ansar <br>of Madinah, it is the women who have the upper hand. <br>Our women have also got influenced by the women <br>over here'. I said a few more similar things which <br>made him smile. I noticed that the contents of his <br>room consisted of only three pieces of tanned skin and <br>a handful of barley lying in a corner. I looked about, <br>but I failed to find anything else. I began to weep. He <br>said; 'Why are you weeping?' I replied: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! why should I not weep? I can see the mat's pat- <br>tern imprinted on your body, and I am also beholding <br>all that you have got in this room. 0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Pray that Allah may grant ample provisions for us. The <br>Persians and the Romans who have no true faith and <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter? Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next. I implored him: '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! Ask forgiveness for me. I was really <br>in the wrong\" <br>Look at the household effects of the sovereign in this <br>world and in the hereafter, and the beloved Prophet of <br>Allah. See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>\"It consisted of a skin filled with the bark of date- <br>palm.\" <br>The same question was put to Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha); <br>she said: <br>\"It consisted of a piece of canvas, which I spread <br>doublefolded under him. Once I laid it fourfold in an <br>effort to make it more comfortable. The next morning <br>he asked me: 'What did you spread under me last <br>night?' I replied! 'The same canvas, but I had four- <br>folded it instead of the customary double fold.' He <br>said: 'Keep it as it was before. The additional softness <br>stands in the way of getting up for Tahajjud.\"' <br>Now let us look around and survey the furniture of our <br>bedrooms. We, who live in so much comfort, never hesitate <br>to complain of hard times, instead of being grateful and <br>more obedient to Allah for his bounties. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) in a State <br>of Hunger <br>. <br>Once, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) after <br>wiping his nose with piece of fine linen remarked to him- <br>self: <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>during the night; his wife and his servant taking turns with <br>him in the prayers. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (~adhiyallaho anho) Daily Al- <br>lowance from the Bait-ul Ma1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was a cloth <br>merchant and lived by that trade. On the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), people selected him <br>as the Khalifah. Next day with some cloth slung on his <br>arms, he was proceeding to the market as usual when <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) met him in the way. <br>'Urnar: <br>\"Where are you going to, Abu Bakr?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"To the market\". <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"If you get busy with your trade, who will <br>carry out the duties of the caliphate?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t \"How am I to feed my family then?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Let's go to Abu 'Ubaidah (In charge of\"Bait-ul- <br>Mal), who will fix some daily allowance for <br>you from the 13ait-ul-Mal.\" <br>They both went to Abu 'Ubaidah (Kadhiyallaho anho). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"When Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was selected as <br>Khalifah. he said to the people: 'You well know that I <br>live bv trade, and my income therefrom is sufficient to <br>meet mv expenses. Now I have to devote my full time <br>to the affairs of the state and therefore my family al- <br>lowance shall be paid from the 'Bait-ul-Mal.'\" <br>~ a d h r a tA'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"At the time of his death, Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) directed rjle to hand over to his successor all that <br>was issued to him from the Bait-ul-Mal for his house- <br>hold needs. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>left no cash after him. Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: <br>\"Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) left a milch she-camel, <br>a bowl and a servant.\" <br>A(;c;ording to some other narrators. he left a bedding also. <br>When all these were made over to 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), his successor, he remarked: <br>\"Mav Allah be merciful to Abu Bakr! He has set a pre-<br>cedent for his successors which is very hard t o  <br>follow.\" <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali. Hadhrat <br>Usman, Hadhrat Zubair and Hadhrat Talhah (Radhivallaho <br>anhum) once proposed that Hadhrat Umar's (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) allowance might be increased, as it was hardlv suffi- <br>cient for him. but nobody dared to suggest that to Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho). People approached Ummul- <br>momineen Hadhrat Hafsah (radhivallaho anha), his daugh- <br>ter, and requested her to ascertain 'Umar's (Kadhivallaho <br>anho) reaction to the suggestion without mentioning their <br>names to him. When Hadhrat Hafsah (Kadhiyallaho anha) <br>talked about it to tladhrat IJmar (Kadhivallaho anho), he <br>became angry and said: <br>\"Who are the persons making this suggestion?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Let me first know your opinion.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If I knew them, I would smite them on their faces <br>I-jafsah! just tell me what was the Prophet's best dress <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a pair of reddish brown clothes, which the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wore on Friday or <br>while receiving some envoy.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What was the best of food that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) ever took at your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Simple barley bread was the only food we used to <br>take. One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah! Go and tell these people that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has set a standard by his <br>personal example. I must follow him. My example and <br>that of my other two companions viz., the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and Abu Bakr (Radhival- <br>laho anho) is like that of three men travelling on the <br>same road. The first man started with a provision and <br>reached the goal. The second followed the first and <br>joined him. Now the third is on his way. If he follows <br>their way, he will also join them, otherwise he can <br>never reach them;' <br>Such is the life of the person who was a dread for the <br>monarchs of the world. What a simple life he lived! Once <br>he was reciting the Khutbah when it was noticed that his <br>lower cloth had as many as twelve patches, including one <br>of leather. Once he came late for his Jumu'ah prayer and <br>told the congregation: <br>\"Excuse me, people! I got late because I was washing <br>my clothes and had no other clothes to put on.\" <br>Once he was having his meal when 'Utbah bin Abi <br>Farqad (Radhiyallaho anho) asked permission to see him. <br><br>Ch. III: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 67 <br>He allowed him in and invited him to share the food with <br>him. 'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when <br>vieing with one another in running after the luxuries of this <br>world. <br>6. <br>Bilal's (Radhiyallaho anho) story about the Prophet: <br>Someone inquired of Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) how <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) met his expenses. <br>He replied: <br>\"He never kept back anything for future use. I arranged <br>money for him. Whenever a needy person, whether <br>hungry or naked, came to him, he would make him <br>over to me and I would then arrange for his needs by <br>borrowing money from somebody. This is what usually <br>happened. Once a Mushrik came to me and said: 'Look <br>here! I have a lot of money to spare. Don't borrow <br>money from anvbody else. Whenever you need it, <br>come straight to me.' I exclaimed: 'This is indeed fine.' <br>I began to borrow money from him to meet the needs <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). One day, <br>after I had taken mv Wudhu and was about to call <br>Azaan, the same Mushrik accompanied bv some <br>people came and shouted, '0,Negro!' When I attended <br>to him. he began to abuse me, using filthv language <br>and said: 'How manv davs are left of this month? 'I <br>Stories of the Saltaabah \t<br>said: 'It is about to finish. 'He said most insolently: <br>'Look here! there are only four days left of this month. <br>If you fail to clear up your debts by the end of the <br>month. 1 shall take you as my slave for my money and <br>then you will be grazing sheep as you have been doing <br>before.' After saying this he went away. I remained <br>melancholy and full of grief throughout the day. After <br>Isha when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was alone, I went and narrated the story to him, <br>saying: '0, Prophet of Allah! you have nothing with <br>you. nor can I arrange any money from somewllere so <br>quickly. I am afraid the Mushrik will disgrace me. I <br>therefore intend to keep away for such time as you get <br>sufficient money to clear the debts.' I went home, took <br>my sword, shield, and shoes, and waited for the morn- <br>ing to make for some other place. lust before dawn, <br>somebody came to me and said. 'Hurry up. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wants you.' I hur-<br>ried to the musjid and found four loaded camels sitting <br>near the Prophet. He said: 'Good news. Bilal. Allah has <br>made arrangements for clearing your debts. Take these <br>camels with their load. The Chief of Fidak has sent <br>them as a gift to me.' I thanked Allah and took the <br>camels and cleared up all the debts. In the meantime, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept sitting in <br>the musjid. When I returned, I said: 'Alhamdulillah.' <br>All the debts are now clear, 0.Prophet of Allah' He in- <br>quired: 'Is there anvthing left from the gift?\" I said, <br>\"Yes, somethirlg is still left.\" He said. \"Go and spend <br>that as well. I shall not go home until the whole lot is <br>spent.' The Propket kept sitting in the musjid all day <br>long. After Isha he inquired again if everything had <br>been spent. I said: 'Something is still left unspent. A <br>few of the poor have not turned up so far.' He slept in <br>the nlusjid that night. Next dav after Isha'a he again <br>called me to him and said: 'Bilal! Is everything fin- <br>ished now?\" I said: 'Yes, Allah has blessed you with <br>peace. Everything is now spent and gone.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) begail to hymn the Glory <br>of Allah over this news, for he did not like death to <br>overtake him while any of the riches were in his pos- <br>session. He then went home and met his family.\" <br>It is common with pious people that they do not like to <br>keep any wealth with them. How could the Prophet (Sallal- <br>e <br><br>Ch. Ill: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 69 <br>laho alaihe wasallam), being the fountain-head of all piety, <br>like to keep anything in his possession? It is said of Mau- <br>lana Abdur Rahim (May Allah have mercy on him), a Saint <br>of our time, that all that he received as gifts from the <br>people was immediately spent by him and he did not keep <br>anything for himself. A few days before his death, he gave <br>over all his clothes to one of his attendants and said: <br>\"If I need to wear any clothes in my life. I shall borrow <br>them from you.\" <br>And I also know about my late father, who whenever had <br>any money left after Maghrib, would give it to someone of <br>his creditors (he was several thousand rupees in debt) and <br>would say 'I would not like to keep this source of trouble <br>with me for the night.' <br>7. \t<br>Another story of Hadhrat Abu Hurairah's (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) Hunger: <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I wish you had seen some of us living on a starvation <br>diet for several days, successively, so much so that we <br>could not even stand erect. On account of spasms of <br>hunger, I would lie on my belly and press my stomach <br>against the ground or keep a stone tied to mv abdomen. <br>Once, I intentionally sat in wait for some notable <br>people to pass that way. As Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) came along, I joined in conversation <br>with him, intending to continue the talk till we reach <br>his home, where I expected him to invite me to share <br>his meals, as was his wont. But his answer was brief, <br>and my plan did not work. The same thing happened <br>with Hadhrat Umar, (Radhiyallaho anho) when he <br>chanced that way. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) himself was the next to come. A smile spread <br>on his face when he saw me, for he at once divined <br>why I was sitting there. 'Come with me, Abu Hurairah', <br>lie said, and I accompanied him to his house. He took <br>me in. where a bowl of milk was brought before him. <br>He asked, 'Who brought this milk?\" and was told that <br>somebody had sent it as a present. HA bade me to go <br>and invite all the Suffah friends. The Suffah people <br>were treated as everyone's guests by all the Muslims. <br>I'hev were such persons who had neither hearth nor <br>home of their own, nor anv other means of livelihood. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Their number varied with time. But at this particular <br>juncture, they mustered seventy in all. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>and returned the same to me, till all of them were <br>served. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>held the,goblet in his own hand, smiied at me, and re- <br>marked, 'Only two of us are left now!' 'Quite so', I re-<br>plied. 'Then take it,' he said. I needed no second <br>bidding, and took enough. He exhorted me to have <br>more, and I had my fill; till I declared that I had no <br>room for any more. He then took hold of the bowl, and <br>drained the still remaining milk.\" <br>I <br>8. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) opinion <br>about two persons: <br>Some people were sitting with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) when a person passed that way. The <br>Prophet (Sailallaho alaihe wasallam) asked of the company: <br>I <br>\"What do you think of this person?\" <br>They replied: <br>, <br>\"0.Pro het of Allah! He is the scion of a good family. <br>: <br>By Alla R, he is such that if he seeks in marriage the <br>hand of a woman of the most illustrious family, ne <br>would not be rejected. If he recommends anybody, his <br>recommendation would be readily accepted.\" <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>people, are far from the path of Allah. It is said in Hadith: <br>\"It will be the end of this world when there remains <br>not a single soul to hymn the name of Allah. It is by <br>the holy name of Allah that the system of this universe <br>is running.\" <br>9. \t<br>Privations go with love for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) <br>A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! I love you so much.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Think well before you say this.\" <br>The person: <br>\"I have already given thought. I love you very much, <br>0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Think once <br>again before you declare such a thing.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con- <br>tingent with food, Hadhrat Qais (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>buying three camels daily from his own men, to feed the <br>Mujahideen, with a promise to pay on return to Madinah. <br>The Amir seeing that the slaughter of camels would de- <br>prive the party of their only means of transport, prohibited <br>him to do so. He collected the dates that had been left with <br>each person and stored them in a bag. He would issue one <br>date to each man as his daily ration. When Hadhrat Jahir <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) later on narrated this story to the <br>people, one of his aud?ence inquired: <br>\"How did you manage to live upon one date only for <br>the whole day?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"We longed even for that one date, when the whole <br>stock was exhausted. We were on the verge of starva- <br>tion. We moistened the dry tree-leaves with water and <br>ate them.\" <br>When they reached this stage, Allah had mercy on them, <br>for He always brings ease after every hardship, provided it <br>is endured patiently. A big fish known as \"Ambar\" was <br>thrown out of the sea for them. The fish was so big that <br>they lived on it for eighteen days altogether. They also <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 73 2- 4<br>2 s  <br>filled their satchels with the remaining portion, which -22 <br>lasted them right up to Madinah. When the episode was $2<br>* <br>narrated to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he <br>said: <br>\"The fish was a provision arranged for you by Allah.\" <br>Difficulties and hardships are not uncommon in this <br>world to the people of Allah; these are bound to come. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"The worst trials in this world are reserved for the <br>Prophets, then for those who are next to them, and <br>then for those who are best of the rest.\" <br>The trial of a person is proportionate to his position near <br>Allah, and He bestows solace and comfort by His Grace and <br>Mercy after each trial. Look how much our ancestors in <br>Islam have suffered in the path of Allah. They had to live <br>on leaves of trees, starve and shed their blood in the service <br>of the true faith, which we now fail to preserve. <br><br>r <br>CHAPTER IV <br>PIETY AND SCRUPULOUSNESS <br>The habits and traits of character of the Sahabah, as a <br>whole, are worth following, as they were the people <br>specially chosen and selected by Allah to be the compan- <br>ions of His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been sent in the best period of human history.\" <br>The time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>itself a blessed period, and the people favoured with his <br>company were really the cream of that age. <br>? <br>1. \t The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepts a <br>woman's invitation: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) 'was once re- <br>turning from a funeral, when a woman invited him to par- <br>take of some food at her house. He went in with some of <br>his Sahabah. When the food was served, it was noticed that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was trying to <br>chew a morsel, but it would simply not go down his throat. <br>He said: <br>\"It seems that the animal has been slaughtered without <br>the permission of its owner.\" <br>The woman said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I had asked a man to purchase a <br>goat for me from the market, but he could not obtain <br>one. My neighbour also had recently purchased a goat. <br>So I sent the man thither with some money to buy the <br>! <br>same from him: My neighbour was out and his wife <br>made over the goat to my man.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) directed her to go <br>and serve the meat to the captives. <br>It has been noted of pious and saintly Muslims that <br>I <br>food obtained from doubtful sources would simply not go <br>down their throats. So this is not such a surprising thing in <br><br>the case of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who is <br>the fountain-head of all piety. <br>2. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Sleepless <br>Night: <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spent a <br>sleepless night. He would turn from side to side and could <br>not sleep. His wife asked him: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Why can you not sleep?\" <br>He responded: <br>\"A date was lying about. I took it up and ate it, lest it <br>should be wasted. Now I am troubled lest it might be <br>from Sadaqah.\" <br>Most probably the date belonged to the Prophet him- <br>self, but because people sent him their 'Sadaqah' as well <br>(for distribution), he could not sleep with the apprehension <br>that it might be of Sadaqah. This is the last word in <br>scruples from the master himself, that he could not sleep <br>because of a suspicion in his mind. How would it go with <br>those who claim themselves to be the slaves of that very <br>master but indulge in usury, corruption, theft, plunder and <br>every other type of 'haraam' business without the least <br>scruple. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and a sooth- <br>sayer's food: <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had a slave <br>who used to give him a portion of his daily income as the <br>masier's share. Once he brought him some food, and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) took a morsel out of it. <br>Then the slave remarked: <br>\"You always enquire about the source of what I bring <br>to you, but today you have not done so.\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I was feeling so hungry that I failed to do that. 'Tell <br>me now, how did you come by this food?\" <br>The slave said: <br>\"Before I embraced Islam, I practised sooth-saying. <br>During those days I came across some people for <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'The flesh nourished by haraam food, is des- <br>tined for the fire of Hell.' I, therefore, made haste to <br>vomit this morsel, lest any portion of my body should <br>receive nourishment from it.\" <br>Many stories of this nature have been reported about <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). As he was very <br>scrupulous and would not taste anything but that about <br>which he was perfectly sure, even the slightest doubt about <br>its being 'halal' would make him vomit what he had taken. <br>4. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) vomits out milk <br>of Sadaqah: <br>A person once brought some milk for Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). When he took it, he noted its queer <br>taste, and asked the person as to how he had come in pos- <br>session of the milk. He replied: <br>\"The camels given in Sadaqah were grazing in the <br>desert, and the attendants gave me this milk out of <br>what they got from them.\" <br>LJpon this. I-iadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) put his hand <br>in his throat and vomited all that he had taken. <br>These God-fearing people not only totally abstained <br>from 'haraam' food. but were most anxious to avoid anv <br><br>w <br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>3s:<br>%d<br>i;<br>doubtful morsel finding its way inside them. They could <br>.c2~<br>not dare taking anything that was 'haraam', which is so <br>usual these days. <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Bait-ul-Maal: <br>Ibn-Seereen writes: <br>\"When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he said to his daughter, Hadhrat Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), 'I did not like to take anything <br>from the Bait-ul-Maal, but Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) insisted on it, to relieve me of my occupation, <br>and to enable me to devote nly full time to the duties <br>of the 'Khilafat: and I was left no choice. Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"May Allah bless your father! He has left no chance for <br>anybodv to open his lips against him.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) received his <br>subsistence allowance from the Bait-ul-maal in the interest <br>of all the Muslirns, and that too at the request of the most <br>prominent Sahabah. Again the amount taken was almost <br>the minimum possible, and hardly sufficient for him, as we <br>have already seen in the story (in the last chapter) about his <br>wife's inability to cook one sweet dish during the whole <br>month. In spite of all this he was so scrupulous that he <br>made over his garden to the Bait-ul-nlaal i l l  lieu of ~vhat he <br>had received from the public funds. <br>6. \t<br>The story of Ali bin Ma'bad: (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>Ali bin Ma'bad (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mohaddith. He <br>savs: <br>\"I was living in a rented Iiouse. Once I wrote some- <br>thing which 1 wanted to drv up quicklv. The house <br>walls were of mud and 1 intended to scrape a little <br>mud from there to dry up the ink. But I thought: \"This <br>house is not mine, and I cannot scrape the walls with- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder- <br>ness and solitude! How fare you in the other world? <br>How has it gone with you there?' He continued: 'The <br>news from our side is that all you did leave of the <br>wealth and riches here, has long been distributed; your <br>children are orphans; your widows have long since re- <br>married. Now let us hear about you.' He then turned to <br>me: '0 Kumail! If they could speak, they would have <br>informed us that the best provision for the Hereafter is <br>Taqwa.' Tears yelled out of his eyes, as he added: '0 <br>Kumail! The grave is a container of the deeds; hut one <br>realizes it only after death.\" <br>Our good or bad actions are stored up in our graves. It <br>is said in a Hadith that every person meets his good deeds <br>in the grave in the person of an agreeable companion who <br>befriends and consoles him there. But his wicked deeds <br>assume hideous shapes emitting bad smells, which add to <br>his misery. In another Hadith it is said: <br>\"Three things accompany a person to his grave viz: His <br>wealth (as was the prevalent custom among the Arabs <br>of the time), his relatives, and his deeds. His wealth <br>and his relatives turn back after his burial, but his ac- <br>tions go in and stay with him in the grave.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else,' This brother is his <br>wordly wealth. He then questions the last brother in <br>the same strain, who makes response: 'I shall not for- <br>sake you even in your grave; and I shall accompany <br>you into that place of utter solitude. When your deeds <br>are weighed in the balance. I shall forthwith lend my <br>weight to the scale of your good deeds and weigh it <br>down.' This brother is the personification of his good <br>deeds. Now, tell me, which of the brothers you regard <br>to be the most useful to the person?' The Sahabah re- <br>plied: '0, Prophet of Allah! The last brother is really <br>the most useful to him. There is no doubt about it. The <br>other two brothers were of no avail.\" <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) verdict <br>about haraam food: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"As Allah Himself is above all blemishes, likewise. He <br>blesses with His grace only the unblemished thi~igs. He <br>enjoins upon the Muslims, what He has laid 3own for <br>His Prophets. He savs in His Holy Book: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah <br>does sometimes grant the prayers of even a Kafir (not to <br>mention the prayer or requests of a sinful Muslim). but it is <br>pnrticularlv the prayer of a pious person that is seldom re- <br>jected. That is the reason why people generally seek the <br>prayers of such persons for themselves. It follows that <br>those who wish to have their prayers often granted must <br>abstain from haraam. No wise person would like to run the <br>risk of his prayers being rejected. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) does not like his <br>wife to weigh musk: <br>I-ladhrat (Jmar (Kadhiyallaho anhn) once received some <br>nli~skfrom Bahrain. I-le said: <br>\"I tvant someone to weigh it, so that it mav be equally <br>distri1)uted among the Muslims.' <br>llis ~viit? said: \"1 shall weigh it..\" <br>tiiiclhriit Umar (Kadhivallaho anho) kept quiet. A little later <br>ht: again asked for someone to weigh the musk, and again <br>his wife volullteered to do so. But he kept quiet this tiine <br>too. C'lrhen she repeated her offer for the third time, he said: <br><br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>\"I do not like your touching the musk with your hands <br>(while weighing it) and rubbing those hands on your <br>body afterwards, as that would amount to something <br>over and above my legitimate share.\" <br>Any other person weighing the musk would, for that <br>matter, have had the same advantage, but Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) did not like this preference particu- <br>larly for any member of his own family. Look at this scru- <br>pulous anxiety to avoid charge of selfishness. <br>A similar story is related about Hadhrat Umar bin <br>Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) (who is known as the <br>second Umar). While he was holding the reins of the Khila- <br>fat, musk belonging to the Bait ul-Maal was being weighed. <br>He closed his own nostrils, with the remark: <br>\"The use of musk is to smell it.\" <br>These were the scruples of the Sahabah, and their suc- <br>cessors, and our elders in Islam. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>dismisses a governor: <br>Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) ap- <br>pointed a person as governor of a province. Somebody re- <br>marked that this person had held the same post under <br>Hajjaj-bin-Yusuf (the notorious blood shedder) also. Hadh- <br>rat Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) immediately <br>issued orders of his dismissal. The man protested: <br>\"I had been with Hajjaj only for a very short time.\" <br>To this, the Khalifa replied: <br>\"His company for a day or even less is sufficient t~ <br>render a man unfit for public service.\" <br>\"A man is known by the companv he keeps.\" The <br>company of pious people leaves an imperceptible impres- <br>sion of piety on the character, and likewise evil company <br>has its evil influence. That is why association with bad <br>people is always discouraged. Even the companv of ani- <br>mals is not without its own effect. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\" <br><br>CHAPTER V <br>DEVOTION TO SALAAT <br>Salaat is the most important of all forms of worship. It <br>is, in fact, the first and foremost item to be reckoned with <br>on the Day of Judgement. .The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the only line of demarcation between Kufr <br>and Islam.\" <br>There are many Ahadith about Salaat, which. I have col- <br>lected in a separate book. <br>1. \t Blessings of Nafl (non-obligatory) Prayers: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reported that <br>Allah told him: <br>\"My wrath descends upon a person who bears ill-will <br>towards My friends. And only those are blessed with <br>My love who implicitly carry out Fardh (obligatory) in- <br>junctions. A person keeps on advancing in my esteem <br>through 'Nafl'; till I choose him as 'My beloved'. I then <br>become his ear by which he listens, his eye by which <br>he looks, his hands by which he holds, and his feet by <br>which he walks (i.e. his listening, looking, holding and <br>walking are all in perfect accord with My injunctions, <br>and he would never even dream of employing any part <br>of his body in any action contrary to My commands). If <br>such a person prays for anything, I grant it to him and <br>if he seeks My protection I do protect him.\" <br>Those people are really blessed who, after performing <br>their Fardh, are in the habit of observing Nafl profusely. <br>May Allah give me and all my friends the strength to earn <br>this blessing. <br>2. \t<br>The Propet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spends the <br>whole night in Salaat: <br>A certain person asked A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Tell <br>me something noteworthy concerning the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to <br>me these verses?' <br>'Lo! in the creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and in <br>the difference of night and day, are tokens (of His Sov- <br>ereignty) for men of understanding, such as remember <br>Allah. standing'sitting and reclining . . . (111:190-191)' \" <br>It has been reported in many Ahadith that the Pro- <br>phet's feet would get swollen because of his very long ra- <br>kaats in Salaat; people tried to reason with him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are sinless and still you <br>labour so hard!\" <br>He would reply: \"Should I not be a grateful slave of my <br>Allah, then?\" <br>3. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recitation <br>of the Qur'an in Salaat: <br>Hadhrat 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>85 sa <br>2 2  <br>\"I was once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). He brushed his teeth with a Miswak, performed <br>.g 4<br>s w<br>his Wudhu and stood up for Salaat. I also availed of * <br>the opportunity to join him. He recited surah 'Baqarah' <br>in his first rakaat; he would pray for mercy when he re- <br>cited any verse extolling the Grace of Allah, and would <br>supplicate for Divine forgiveness when reciting any <br>verse referring to His wrath. He took as much time in <br>Ruku' and Sajdah each as he had taken in Qiyaam. In <br>Ruku' he recited: <br>'Glory to Allah the Lord of Majesty, sovereignty and <br>magnificence.' <br>He recited the next three successive Soorahs in the re- <br>maining three rakaats, and each rakaat was of about the <br>same length as the first one.\" <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) has also narrated a <br>similar story about his Salaat with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam.) <br>The Qiraat (recitation) of the Qur'an by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the above mentioned four <br>rakaats amounts to more than one-fifth of he whole Qur'an. <br>And the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited the <br>Qur'an with proper intonation (Tajweed), and would also <br>pray and seek forgiveness after relevant verses. Again his <br>Ruku' and Sajdah also would last as long as his Qiyaarn. <br>We can thus have a fair idea of how much time he must <br>have taken to say his Salaat. This can only be possible <br>when Salaat is a source of great inner satisfaction and spiri- <br>tual ecstasy. That is why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) has often been quoted as saving: <br>\"The comfort of mv eyes lies in Salaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>Salaat of a Few Eminent Sahabah: <br>Hadhrat Mujahid (Radhiyallaho anho), describing the <br>Salaat of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), and that <br>of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"They stood in Salaat motionless like pieces of wood <br>stuck in the ground.\" <br>'Ulama agree that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyai- <br>laho anho) learnt to say his Salaat from Hadhrat Abu Hakr <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! The child's life was in <br>danger, and you took least notice of it.\" <br>His answer Mas: <br>\"Had I turned my attention to anything else, what <br>would have remained of the Salaat?\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was stabbed at the <br>close of his career, and this same wound caused his death. <br>He bled profusely and remained unconscious for long in- <br>tervals. But when hewas informed of the time of Salaat, he <br>would perform it in that very condition, and say: <br>\"There is no portion in Islam for the person who dis- <br>cards Salaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) would remain in <br>Salaat all night long, finishing the whole of the Qur'an in <br>one rakaat. <br>It is reported about Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that he would turn pale and tremble at the time of Salaat. <br>Somebody asked him the reason, and he said: <br>\"It is the time to discharge that trust which Allah of- <br>fered to the Heavens and the Earth and the hills, but <br>they shrank from bearing it, and I have assumed it.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>Somebody asked Khalaf-bin-Ayub: <br>\"Do not the flies annoy you in your Salaat?\" <br>His answer was: <br>\"Even the sinful persons patiently bear the lashes of <br>the government, to boast of their endurance afterwards. <br>Why should I be made to skip about by mere flies <br>when standing in the presence of my Lord?\" <br>Muslim bin Yasaar when he stood up for Salaat, said to <br>members of his family: <br>\"You may keep on talking, I shall not be knowing what <br>you talk.\" <br>Once he was saying his Salaat in the Jaami' musjid of <br>Basrah. A portion of the musjid wall fell down with a <br>crash; and eveFy body ran pel1 me11 for safety, but he never <br>even heard the noise. <br>Somebody asked Haatim Asam as to how did he say <br>his Salaat. <br>He replied: <br>\"When the time for Salaat comes, I perform my Wudhu <br>and go to the place where I have to say my Salaat. I sit <br>down for some time, till all the parts of my body are re- <br>laxed. Then I stand up for Salaat, visualising the <br>Ka'bah in front of me, imagining my feet upon the <br>Bridge of Siraat, with Paradise to my right, and Hell to <br>my left, and Izraa-eel close behind me, and thinking <br>that it may be my last Salaat. Then I say my Salaat <br>with full sincerity and devotion. And I finish my <br>Salaat between fear and hope about its acceptance. <br>5. <br>Salaat of a Muhajir and an Ansari keeping watch: <br>While returning from a campaign, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) happened to halt for the night at <br>some place. He inquired: <br>\"Who would keep watch over the camp this night?\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar bin Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) of the Mu- <br>hajirin and Hadhrat Abbaad bin Bishr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>of the Ansar offered their services. Both of them were <br>posted to watch from a hill-top against any possible night <br>attack by the enemy. <br><br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) said to Ammar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Let us keep watch and sleep turn by turn. In the first <br>half of the night I shall keep awake, while you go to <br>sleep. In the next half. you may keep watch while I go <br>to sleep.\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) agreed and went <br>to sleep, and Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) started <br>his Salaat. But an enemy scout made him out in the dark <br>from a distance. and let flv an arrow at him. Seeing that he <br>made no movernent, he shot another and still another <br>arrow at him. Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) drew <br>out arid threw away each arrow as it struck him, and at last <br>awakened his conlpanion. The enemy fled when he saw <br>them both together. fearing that there might be many more <br>of them. Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) rioticed <br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) bleeding from three places. He <br>said: <br>\"Subhanallah! whv did you not awake me earlier?\" <br>Abbaad replied: <br>\"I had started.reciting Surah 'Kahf' in my Salaat. I did <br>not like to cut it short. but when I was struck by the <br>third arrow. ,I was greatly concerned that my death <br>might jeopardise the safety of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I therefore finished the Salaat and <br>awakened you. But for this fear. I would not have gone <br>to Ruku' before finishing the Surah even if I had been <br>killed.\" <br>I <br>Look at the devotion of'the Sahaba to Salaat. One <br>arrow after another is piercing Hadhrat Abbaad's (Rad-<br>hiyallaho anho) body and he is bleeding profusely, but is <br>not prepared to sacrifice the pleasure of reciting the Qur'an <br>in his Salaat. On the other hand, the bite of a wasp, nay of a <br>mosquito, is sufficient to distract us from our Salaat. <br>According to the Hanafiyvah school of jurisprudence, <br>Wudhu breaks with bleeding, while according to the Sha- <br>fi'iyyah it does not. lt is just possible that Abbaad might be <br>having the latter view. or that this point might not have <br>been brought to an issue till then. <br><br>6. \t<br>Hadhrht Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>m<br>Salaat: \t<br>.-<br>,om <br>V1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) was once <br>saying his Salaat in his garden. His attention was drawn to- <br>wards a bird that flitted about, but could not find a way out <br>of the dense foliage. For a short moment, he followed the <br>bird with his eyes, and forgot the number of his rakaat. <br>Upon this mishap, his sorrow knew no bounds. He re-<br>paired to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pres- <br>ence straightway and submitted thus: <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah, this garden of mine has been the <br>cause of a diversion in my Salaat. I give it away in the <br>cause of Allah. Kindly spend it as may appear proper <br>to you.\" <br>A similarchance befell one of the Ansaar in the time of <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). He was saving his <br>Salaat in his garden. The branches of the trees were <br>weighed down with ripe juicy dates, luxurious abundance, <br>which caught his eyes, and he felt pleased with it. This <br>made him forget the number of his rakaat. He was so much <br>stricken with grief that he decided to part with the garden <br>that had distracted him from his Salaat. He approached <br>Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) and made over the garden to <br>him for utilising it in the path of Allah. LJsman (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) had the garden sold for fifty thousand dirhams <br>and spent the money as desired. This shows the value the <br>Sahaba set on their faith; and Hadhrat Abu Talha (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) could give away his orchard worth fifty <br>thousand dirhams because it had interfered with his Salaat. <br>According to Shah Waliullah, the Sufis give preference to <br>obedience to Allah over anything that distracts from it. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eye. A doctor told him: <br>\"A treatment is possible, provided you are willing to <br>take precautions. For five davs, it will be essential for <br>you to avoid prostrating yourself on the ground. You <br>can, however, use a wooden desk for performing <br>Sajdah.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once <br>visited the market. He noticed that at the time of Salaat, <br>everybody closed his shop and flocked to the musjid. He <br>remarked: <br>\"These are people about whom Allah has remarked: <br>\"Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when <br>hearts and eyeballs will be overturned. <br>(XXIV: 3 7)\" <br>i <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"These people were completely absorbed in their <br>trade, but when they heard Azaan they left everything <br>and hastened towards the musjid.\" \t<br>I <br>He once remarked: \"By Allah, they were such traders <br>whose trade did not hinder them from the remembrance of <br>I <br>Allah.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>91 SJZ <br>L. -<br>\"9 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>once chanced to be in the market when Azaan was called <br>3,<br>m<br>out. He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning. Again it <br>will be asked, 'who are those who kept away from their <br>beds and passed their nights in worshipping their Cre- <br>ator.' Another group will arise and enter Paradise with- <br>out any reckoning. The angel will ask yet again, 'where <br>are those whom trade did not hinder from remember- <br>ing Allah.' And yet another group will arise and enter <br>Paradise without any reckoning. After these three <br>groups have departed, and reckoning would com-<br>mence for the people in general.\" <br>9. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Khubaib, Hadhrat Zaid and <br>Hadhrat 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anhum): <br>The Qureysh writhed with fury and rage at the loss of <br>some of their greatest men in Uhud. Sulaifah, whose two <br>sons had fallen in action, had taken a solemn vow that she <br>would drink wine in the skull of 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>who had killed both of them, if she could get possession of <br>his head. She had proclaimed a prize of one hundred <br>camels (a stupendous sum for the place and the time) for <br>the person who brought 'Asim's head to her. Sufyan bin <br>Khalid worked out a plan to secure the prize. He sent a few <br>men of Adhal Waqarah to Madinah, who pretended to em: <br>brace Islam: they besought the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) to detail some persons to accompany them to <br>their locality to preach Islam to the populace. They made a <br>special request for 'Asim (Kadhiyallaho anho) saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Our people will very much appreciate his mode of <br>address.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed ten (or <br>six according to another report) of his companions to go <br>with them, and 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) was of course in- <br>cluded in these. They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations. Allah, <br>the most beloved, is with you, and your celestial <br>spouses are this minute waiting for you.\" <br>With these words, he rushed into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and when his spear broke he fought on with his <br>sword. Thus he fell fighting to the last. His last prayer was: <br>\"0,Allah! inform the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) about our fate.\" <br>Allah, in His compassion, answered his prayer by revealing <br>the news to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). As <br>'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) had come to know about Sula- <br>fah's vow to drink wine in his skull, he also prayed: <br>\"0,Allah! I have laid down my life in Thy cause: 0, <br>Allah, do save my head from the sacriligeous hands of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>This prayer was also granted. After his death, a swarm of <br>bees (or wasps according to another report) settled upon <br>his body, and foiled all attempts of the enemy to sever his <br>head. They left the body alone, intending to do their.dirty <br>job during the night, when the bees would have gone. But <br>during the night, there was a cloud-burst, which washed <br>the body away. <br>I <br><br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise. I would rather join my martyred brothers than go <br>alive with you.\" <br>He then refused to follow them in captivity. They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then. The two re- <br>maining captives were taken by them to Mecca and sold to <br>the Qureysh. Safwan bin Umayyah paid fifty camels for <br>Zaid bin Wathna (Kadhiyallaho anho] to kill him in re- <br>venge for the death of his father Umayyah in 'Uhud', and <br>Hujair bin Abi Ahaab bought Khubaib (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>for one hundred camels to avenge the fall of his father in <br>the same battle. <br>Safwan made over Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>to his slave to be killed outside the limits of the Haram. A <br>crowd followed them to watch Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anhp) meet his end, and Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also happened to be one of the spectators. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) stood prepared to meet his doom, Abu <br>Sufyan asked him thus: <br>\"Don't yo11 \\I ,11 hluhalnmad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to be in vour place today, and you be let off to <br>enjoy life with your family?\" <br>Zaid's (Kadhivallaho anho) replv amazed them all: <br>\"Hv Allah!\" he said. \"the trerv tho~~ght <br>of enjoying life <br>with nlv family is unbearable to me. if the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were even to suffer a <br>thorn-prick in his foot for that.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Qureysh simply could not understand this reply, and <br>Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"There is absolutely no parallel, anywhere in the <br>world, to the love that the companions of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bear him.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was then martyred. <br>Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the <br>captivity of Hujair for a long time. A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing <br>the child with the razor. But to remove their fears on <br>observing their alarm, Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhoj remarked: 'Do you think that I would stoop to <br>the killing of an innocent child? This heinous crime is <br>simply not possible for me.'\" <br>When he was brought to the gallows, and asked to <br>make his last wish, if any, he requested: <br>\"Allow me to say two rakaat of Salaat, for it is time for <br>me to leave the'world and meet my Allah.\" <br>They let him say his Salaat. On finishing the two rakaat <br>most calmly, he said: <br>\"But for your thinking that I was afraid of death, I <br>would have said another two rakaats.\" <br>He was then tied to the gallows. At that time he said: <br>\"0,Allah! There is nobodv to convey my last Salaam <br>to Thy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>And Allah sent his Salaam to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through an angel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) answered: <br>\"Wa alaikumus salaam! 0 Khubaib.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>3 I11<br>and observed to the Sahabah: \t<br>'C C, <br>\"Khubaib has been martyred by the Qureysh.\" <br>m <br>S m  <br>At the gallows, forty of the Querysh speared him simul- <br>taneously. One of those teased him: <br>Say by Allah, if you now wish Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) to be in your place and you to be let <br>off.\" <br>He replied: \t \"By Allah the Most Magnificent. I will not tol- <br>erate a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in ransom for my life.\" <br>Every word of this story is a lesson for us all. The de- <br>votion and love of the Sahabah narrated therein is really <br>something to esteem and covet. They would lay down their <br>very lives, but they would not tolerate even a thorn piick- <br>ing the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Again, look at <br>Hadhrat Khubaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) last wish. He <br>neither remembers his family members nor wishes to see <br>any of them; what he wishes is to send his last Salaam to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and to say two last <br>rakaats of Salaat. <br>10. Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) company in <br>Paradise: <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"1 used to remain in attendance upon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) at night. I would keep water, <br>miswak, praying mat, etc., ready for his Tahajjud. Once <br>he (being very pleased with my services) asked me, <br>'What would you wish most?' I submitted, '0,Prophet <br>of Allah. I wish your company in Paradise.' He asked <br>me if there was anything else I wished for. But I re-<br>plied. 'This is the only thing I long for.' Upon this, he <br>remarked. 'All right. You should help me by prostrat- <br>ing in prayer frequently.' \" <br>Here is a lesson for us. We should not depend on <br>verbal prayers alone, but we should also make some practi- <br>cal efforts to gain our object. The best of all efforts is Salaat. <br>Also, it would be wrong to depend entirely on the prayers <br>of saints and pious people alone. This is a world of cause <br>and effect: and, no doubt, Allah sometimes in His Wisdom <br>and Might does bring into effect things for which there is <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too). <br><br>CHAPTER VI <br>SYMPATHY AND SELF-SACRIFICE <br>The Sahabah, as a class, were an embodiment of right- <br>eousness. They attained a standard that is rather difficult to <br>emulate in a modern society. We would be fortunate if we <br>really attain even a partial resemblance to their character. <br>Some of their qualities are peculiarly their own, and self- <br>sacrifice is one of these. Allah has made a mention of this <br>in the Holv Qur'an in these'words. <br>\"They prkfer others above themselves. even though <br>poverty become their lot. (LIX: 9).\" <br>1. Feeding the guest in darkness: <br>A Sahabi came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and complained of hunger and distress. Just then, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had nothing in hand, <br>or in his home to feed him. He asked the Sahabah: <br>\"Would anybody entertain him as a guest tonight on <br>my behalf?\" <br>One of the Ansaar said: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah, I will do that.\" <br>The Ansari took the person to his house and instructed his <br>wife: <br>\"Look here, this man is a guest of the Prophet [Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We will entertain him as best as <br>we can, and won't spare anything in doing so.\" <br>The wife replied: <br>\"By Allah! I have got no food in the house, except a <br>verv little-something just enough for the children.\" <br>The Ansari said: <br>\"You lull the children to sleep without feeding them, <br>while I sit with the guest over the meagre meal. When <br>we start eating, put out the lamp pretending to set it <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight. When we sit at the meal, <br>put out the lamp, pretending to set it right, and you are <br>not to eat anything until the guest has taken his fill.\" <br>The scheme worked out as in the last story. The husband <br>and wife sat with the guest and the simple soul never sus- <br>pected in the least that neither of them had partaken at all <br>of the food, though their hands and jaws seemed to be <br>moving all right. When Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) repaired to tbe Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) presence next morning, he was greeted with the <br>happy news; <br>\"0,Thabit! Allah has very much appreciated your en- <br>tertainment of the guest last night.\" <br>3. <br>Overpaymentof Zakaat: <br>Hadhrat Ubay bin Kaab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once dep- <br>uted me to collect Zakaat dues from a locality. I went <br>to a person there, and asked about the details of his <br>possessions. A baby camel one year old was due from <br>him in Zakaat. When he heard this, he exclaimed, 'Of <br>what use is a baby camel, one year old? You can <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she-camel in-stead; which he refused to accept <br>without your permission. I have now come to you with <br>the she-camel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) observed, 'No doubt only that much is due from <br>you which he has worked out, but if you are willing to <br>give more than that, of your own accord, it would be <br>accepted.' I then presented the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which he accord- <br>ingly accepted and sought Allah's blessings for the <br>donor.\" <br>Look, with what magnanimity of heart the Sahabah <br>parted with their best things for the sake of Allah. On the <br>other hand, we too claim to be the true followers of Islam, <br>and ardent devotees of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) but, leaving apart the bestowing of alms in general <br>to the poor and the needy, we are most reluctant to pay the <br>actual obligatory dues. Zakaat, as a pillar of Islam, is not <br>even known to our upper classes. Of the middle classes, <br>only the religiously conscious strata keep up a form of <br>paying Zakaat, in as much as even the expenditure in- <br>curred on their own relatives and acquaintances, and all <br>other charitable donations squeezed out of them by the <br>force of circumstances and face-savings are debited to this <br>account. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) trying to emulate <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>for contributions in the path of Allah. In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam): <br>'How mu~h'?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Exactly one-half.' <br>By and by, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>along with his load. It transpired that he had brought <br>everything that he possessed. <br>This is what I heard: ' <br>The Prophet (Sa/lallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'What did you leave for your family, Abu Bakr?' <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'I have left Allah and his Prophet for them.' <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that on that day <br>he admitted to himself that he could never hope to surpass <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Allah says in his Holy Book. <br>\"Vie one with another in good works (V:48).\" <br>Such healthy emulation in sacrifice is therefore quite <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>101 \t & <br>b a<br>0s <br>desirable and welcome. This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well. Thereupon, I hurried as fast as I could to <br>my cousin, and, lo! in the meantime he had also joined <br>the other two. <br>j <br>U! jp,6! <br>Many an incident of such self-denial and heroic sacri- <br>fice is recorded in the books of Hadith. This is the last <br>word in self-sacrifice, that each dying person should forego <br>slaking his own thirst in favour of his other needy brother. <br>May Allah bless their souls with His choicest favours for <br>their sacrifice for others even at the time of death, when a <br>person has seldom the sense to make a choice. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) shroud: <br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dear uncle, <br>and one of his earliest supporters. Hadhrat Hamzah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) fell in Uhud, and the ruthless enemy bru- <br>tally cut off his nose, ears and vitals. He was ripped open, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it, she simply exclaimed, <br>'Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon' and offered a prayer <br>for his soul.\" <br>In another Hadith, Hadhrat ZuLair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself narrates the incident. He says: <br>\"We rnade out a woman drawing near the place where <br>the martyrs of Uhud had been gathered. On her close <br>approach, I recognised her to be my own mother. I ad-<br>vanced to stop her, but she proved to be too strong for <br>me. She thrust me aside, with the words, 'Leave me <br>alone.' Whgn I told her that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had prohibited her from seeing the <br>dead body, she at once desisted from her purpose and <br>explained. \"Hearing the news of my brother's death, I <br>have brought a couple of sheets for his shroud. Take <br>these sheets and make use of them.' We took the sheets <br>and had begun to enshroud the body, when the dead <br>body of an Ansari named Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) caught our eyes. It was also lying close by <br>in the same condition. We considered it a shame to <br>enshroud Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) in two <br>sheets, while the body of another Muslim brother lay <br>bare. We, therefore, decided to use one sheet each for <br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of <br>sympathy, equality and self-sacrifice? Is it not shameful on <br>our part that we, who call ourselves the followers of these <br>illustrious people, do not possess any of these qualities. <br>7. <br>The Story of the Goat's Head: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"One of the Sahabah received a goat's head as a pres- <br>ent. He thought of a neighbour who had a larger family <br>and was in greater need of it thar, himself, and pre- <br>sented the same to him. 'This brother, on receipt of the <br>present, recollected yet another person whom he con- <br>sidered even more deserving than himself, and sent on <br>the head to him. The goat's head is, thus, said to have <br>changed hands no less than seven times, and at last <br>came back to the original person from whom the circu- <br>lation had started.\" <br>We learn from the $tory how poor and needy the Saha- <br>bah usually were, and yet how they indeed preferred others <br>above themselves. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\" <br>The person: <br>\"Please mind your own business.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Do tell me please. May be that I can help you.\" <br>The Derson: <br>\"If you must know, inside there is my wife groaning <br>with labour pains.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Is there anybody else to attend her?\" <br>The person: <br>\"No one.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), thereupon, got up <br>and hurried homewards. He broached the subject to his <br>wife Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) thus: <br>\"Allah has brought you an opportunity to receive great <br>blessings.\" <br>Wife: <br>' <br>\"What is it, 0,Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br><br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with <br>cooking something which those people could eat. After <br>some time, Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>called out from inside the tent, <br>\"Amir-ul-Mominin, congratulate your friend on the <br>birth of a son.\" <br>The person was much embarrassed when he heard the ad- <br>dress of 'Amir-ul-Mominin' and realized the position of the <br>person who had been serving him. But Hadhrat 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) put all his fears to rest, saying: <br>\"That is all right, there is nothing to worry about.\" <br>He then placed the pan near the tent, asking his wife to <br>take it and feed the woman. She fed her and returned the <br>pan. Then Hadhrat U'mar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked the <br>bedouin to partake of the food, as he had kept awake the <br>whole night. <br>Having rendered this service, Hadhrat U'mar (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) returned home with his wife, telling the person <br>\"Come to me tomorrow, and I shall see what I can do for <br>you.\" <br>Is there any king, nay a petty chief, or even an ordinary <br>middle class person of our time, who will thus take his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse, <br>\"You will not attain unto piety until you spend of that <br>which Ye love (111: 92).\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) repaired to the <br>I<br>Prophet's presence and thus opened his heart, <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I love Bir Ha very much. As <br>Allah wants us toppend precisely that which we love, <br>I make over that garden to be spent in the path of Allah <br>as you please.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was very much <br>pleased, and remarked: <br>\"What a fine present (to Allah)! I think it would be <br>best utilized if you distribute it among your own <br>heirs.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and acted <br>upon the Prophet's advice. <br>. <br>Are we prepared to part with any of our dear things for <br>l<br>the sake of Allah so quickly, after reading a verse of the <br>I <br>Qur'an or listening to a well-delivered sermon? <br><br>Ch.

Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) reprimands his <br>servant: <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) was well <br>known for his piety and abstinence. He kept no money <br>with him, and likewise did not like others to hosrd it. He <br>was always fighting against the moneyed class. Hadhrat <br>Usman, (Radhiyallaho anho), therefore, during his caliph- <br>ate advised him to shift to Rabzah (a small village in the <br>desert). He had a few camels to live on, and an old servant <br>to look after them. A tribesman from Banu Sulaim onca <br>presented himself with a request: <br>\"I wish to stay with you to benefit from your knowl- <br>edge of Allah's commandments and the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) ways and habits; I shall also <br>help your servant in looking after the camels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"I cannot keep with me a person who does not comply <br>with my wishes; but if you can always do as bidden, <br>you may remain with me, else I wish good-bye to you.\" <br>The person asked: <br>\"In what way do you like me to carry out your <br>wishes.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"When I ask you to spend from my belongings, you are <br>required to spend the best of them.\" <br>The person says, \"I accepted Hadhrat Abuzar's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) condition and stayed on with him. One <br>day, somebody informed him that there were some poor <br>folk camping near the spring close-by and were in dire <br>need of food. He asked me to fetch a camel. Accordingly, I <br>went and intended to select the best of the lot, as I had <br>pledged to do. It was a very fine and submissive animal <br>and good for riding. so I decided to let it be, and selected <br>the second best, as after all it was only to be slaughtered <br>and eaten and, for this purpose, just as good as the other. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I: \t<br>'I did not forget you instructions, but thought it better <br>to preserve the one for transport duties, while the <br>other was as good for eating.' <br>Abuzar: 'Was it for my personal need that you left it?' <br>I: \t<br>'Yes.' <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Come, let me tell you the occasion of my needs. That <br>is the day when I shall be laid all alone in the solitude <br>of the grave. Remember, there are three partners in <br>your wealth, viz. (1)Your destiny, which does not wait <br>to take away its share. Good or bad it would take away <br>all that it has to take. (2) Your heirs, who are waiting <br>for the day of your death, so that they may take over <br>their share, and (3) Yourself. If you can manage, don't <br>be the most helpless of the three partners. Take your <br>full share, while you can. Allah says: <br>'Ye will not attain unto piety until you spend of tnat <br>. \t<br>which you love. (111: 92). I, therefore, think it advisable <br>to send in advance the things which I love best, so that <br>they may be in safe deposit for me there.' <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>u <br>Ch.

It is very <br>seldom that the heirs give away in the path of Allah the <br>wealth inherited from another person, so that his soul may <br>benefit by it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>remarked: <br>\"Man cherishes his worldly belongings, hugging them <br>to his soul, and gloating, 'my wealth, my wealth,' but <br>in reality only that much of it is his wealth, which he <br>either enjoys in the form of food or dress or spends in <br>the path of Allah to be stored up for him in the Here- <br>after. What is left of his wealth belongs to others; he is <br>only acting as a custodian.\" <br>In another Hadith, it is reported that once the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired of the Sahabah. <br>\"Which of you would rather like to see his wealth in <br>the hands of his heirs than keep it with himself?\" <br>They replied: \"Who would like to be such a person, 0<br>Prophet of Allah? (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex-<br>plained: <br>\"Whatever you send in advance by spending it in the <br>path of Allah is yours, and whatever is left behind be- <br>longs to your heirs.\" <br>11. The Story of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far and Hadhrat <br>.Abdullah Bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma): <br>Hadhrat Ja'far Tayyar (Radhiyallaho anho) is a cousin <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a brother of <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). His whole family is re- <br>nowned for magnanimity, generosity, valour and heroism, <br>but Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) had a special love <br>for the poor and often mingled and associated with them. <br>He emigrated to Abyssinia with the other Muslims at the <br>time of the persecution by Qureysh, and he was the spokes- <br>man who so successfully defended the emigrants in the <br>court of the Negus. This story we have already given in <br>Chapter I. After returning from Abyssinia, he emigrated to <br>Madinah and was martyred in the expedition of Mootah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity <br>just then and this grieved him very much. Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) purchased the whole lot through <br>his agent, and distributed it (free) among the people. He <br>always acted as a host to all the strangers who were <br>stranded in the city during the night. <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), when participat- <br>ing in his last battle, called his son Hadhrat Abdullah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to his side and confided to him that he had <br>a premonition that this was going to be his last fight, in <br>which he was destiried to fall, adding that if it turned out <br>to be so, Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) was to <br>clear all his debts. He further admonished his son to call <br>upon his 'Master' if he encountered any difficulty in doing <br>so. His son, a bit puzzled, inquired as to who his Master <br>was? \"Allah,\" replied Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>The same day he met his fate. When Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) checked the accounts of his <br>father, he discovered debts that amounted to no less than <br>two million dirhams. Having the reputation of being as <br>honest and trustworthy a person as any that ever breathed, <br>people flocked to him for the safe deposit of their money. <br>He invariably address them like this: <br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>8 <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money <br>was due to Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) from his father. He therefore went to him again and <br>said: <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Excuse me. It was my mistake. In fact my father owed <br>you that much money.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If that is the case, I remit the debt.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"No, I must pay it.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You may pay it at your convenience.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Will you accept some land in lieu thereof? (He had re- <br>ceived some land as his share of booty. and he wanted <br>to dispose of it.\") <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yes, if it suits you.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). says, \"I <br>made over to him a piece of waterless land. He asked his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual. <br><br>CHAPTER VII <br>VALOUR AND HEROISM <br>Fear of death was unknown to the Sahabah. They were <br>therefore most fearless and valorous. A person who can <br>look death in the face can meet all situations. There is left <br>for him no attraction in the wealth of this world, and no <br>fear of an enemy. I wish I could inherit this quality from <br>these true heroes. <br>1. \t Ibn Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) and Sa'd (Radhiyal- <br>laho d o )  Pray for Each Other: <br>On the eve'of Uhud, Abdullah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"0.Sa'd! come, let us pray together. Let each pray to <br>Allah for the grant of his sole desire, and the other <br>would say Ameen to it. This way, the praye:s are more <br>likely to be answered by Allah.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) agreed, and they both went to a <br>corner to pray. <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was first to pray, saying: <br>\"0,Allah, when the battle rages tomorrow, let me face <br>a very strong and fierce enemy. Let him attack me with <br>might and main, and let me repulse him with all my <br>strength. Then 0,Allah, let me be triumphant by kill- <br>ing him for your sake, and allow me to have his pos- <br>sessions as booty.\" <br>Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) said; \"Ameen .\" <br>Then Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anno) started his prayer, <br>saying: <br>\"0,Allah, let me face one of the toughest fighters <br>among the enemy tomorrow. Let him attack me with <br>full fury and let me attack him with my full strength. <br>Then let him have the upper hand and kill me. lie may <br>cut my nose and ears from my body. And when I <br>appear before You on the day of Judgement, You may <br>ask me, 'How did you lose your nose and ears, 0,Ab-<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2. Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) valour in Uhud: <br>Neglect of the Prophet's orders changed the victory at <br>Uhud into a defeat, the details of which we have already <br>seen in Chapter I. That was a very hard time for the Mus- <br>lims. They were simply caught between the two groups of <br>the enemy, and many were killed. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was surrounded by the enemy, who <br>spread the rumour that he had died. Most of the Sahabah <br>lost their balance of mind at this rumour, and that was the <br>main cause of their c6nfusion. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were surrounded by the enemy, and I could not <br>see the Prophet (sallalaho alaihe wasallam). I first sea- <br>rched for him among the living and then among the <br>I <br>dead, but I could not find him. I said to myself, 'It is <br>impossible for him to fly from the battle-field. It seems <br>that Allah is angry with us due to our sins, and He has <br>lifted him up to the heavens. There is no way left for <br>me except to jump into the enemy lines and fight till I <br>am killed.' I therefore attacked the enemy, clearing <br>them with my sword till I caught sight of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); I was very happy and was <br>sure that Allah had been protecting him through His <br><br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both.\" <br>Look at the valour of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He jumps into the enemy lines singlehanded, when he is <br>unable to find the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>This also shows his extreme love and devotion to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>3. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anhoj is martyred <br>When the battle of Uhud started, Hadhrat Hanzalah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had just been wedded and therefore <br>did not join the battle from the beginning. It is said that he <br>had just left the bed of his wife and had hardly started <br>taking his bath, when he heard somebody breaking the <br>news about the defeat. He postponed the bath and, with <br>sword in hand, rushed towards the battle-field. He jumped <br>into the enemy concentration, fighting and penetrating till <br>he was killed. Now the body of the person killed in the <br>path of Allah is not washed, unless a bath has been incum- <br>bent on him before his death. Not knowing his failure to <br>take the bath incumbent on him, the Sahabah buried him <br>without a wash. Just before his burial, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I see the angels washing Hanzalah's body.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>very much to join the battle. People said to him: <br>\"You ar excusable, as you are lame. You need not go <br>to the battle.\" <br>He replied: \t \"How sad! that my sons go to Paradise, and I <br>stay behind.\" <br>His wife also wanted him to fight and get martyred, so that <br>she might have the honour of being the widow of a martyr. <br>To exhort him, she said to him: <br>\"I do not believe that people have stopped you from <br>going. It seems that you are yourself afraid to go to the <br>battlefield.\" <br>Hearing this, Hadhrat 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) equipped <br>himself with arms and, facing Qiblah, prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>He then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said: <br>\"I had always wished for martyrdom, but my people <br>have always been stopping me from going into the <br><br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud, <br>again and again. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was informed of this, he said: <br>\"The camel is charged to do that. Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam. In the battle of <br>Uhud, Musab (Radhiyallaho anho) held the flag of Islam. <br>When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in <br>confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. <br>An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the <br>flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at <br>once took the flag in the other hand. The enemy then cut <br>the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with the <br>help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his <br>body with an arrow. He fell dead and, with him fell the flag <br>that he had not allowed to fall while he was alive. Another <br>Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, <br>he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too <br>short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the <br>feet would be exposed, and when it was drawn to cover the <br>feet, the head would become uncovered. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Cover his head with the sheet, and his feet with 'Azk-<br>har'leaves.\" <br>Such was the end of the youth who was brought up in <br>luxury and comfort. The person who used to wear a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams does not have sufficient cloth <br>to cover his dead body. Look! With what valour he tried to <br><br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind <br>in Madinah. Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was very <br>brave and considered to be one of the heroes of Arabia. Iraq <br>was a part of the Persian Empire and Yazdjard was the Em- <br>peror at that time. He sent for one of his best generals <br>named Rustam and charged him with the task of checking <br>the Muslim advance. Rustam tried to avoid going to the <br>front, because of the fear of the Muslims, and requested the <br>Emperor again and again to keep him back, saying: <br>\"I shall make arrangements for the despatch of re-<br>inforcements and shall be of use to your Majesty at the <br>time of counsel.\" <br>But the Emperor did not agree, and he had to go to the <br>battlefield. <br>When Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>leave Madinah, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gave <br>him the following instructions: <br>\"0,Sa'd! Let this fact not beguile you that you are one <br>of the trusted companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and that people call you his uncle. <br>Allah does not repel evil with evil, but He repels evil <br>with good. Allah has no relation with His creation. All <br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\" <br>Ask the people who are addicted to liquor, how much <br>they love to taste it. The Sahabah loved to meet death in <br>the Path of Allah even more. This was the chief cause of <br>their success. <br>7. \t Hadhrat Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) was a shepherd <br>and had been a ~usl\"lm for some time. He lived in his vil- <br>lage in the desert. He came to Madinah to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was accompanied by his <br>nephew and his herd of goats, which he had tied with a <br>rope. He learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was in Uhud. He left his goats and went to Uhud to <br>fight by the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). A group of the enemy was at that time advancing to <br>attack the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet announced: <br>b <br>\"The person who disperses these people will be my <br>companion in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) attacked them fiercely <br>and repulsed all of them. A second and third group of the <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>121 2 3  <br>0s<br>I<br>enemy tried to advance, and each time it was Hadhrat <br>.gs<br>Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) who fought them and put them <br>$ g<br>m<br>to flight single handed. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) gave him good tidings of Paradise. No sooner did <br>he hear this, than he jumped into the enemy lines and <br>fought till he was no more. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I have never seen a person fighting so bravely and <br>fearlessly as Wahb did. I saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) standing beside his dead body, <br>saying, '0Wahb! You have pleased me. May Allah be <br>pleased with you.\" <br>Although the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself <br>was wounded in this battle, yet he buried Wahb's body <br>with his own hands. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to say: <br>\"I never envied anybody more than Wahb (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho). I wish I could appear before Allah with a <br>record as good as his.\" <br>What is it in the life of Hadhrat Wahb (Radhivallaho <br>anho) that makes an illustrious and exalted person like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to envy him. It is the <br>same spirit of sacrifice for the sake of Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even though Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and other Sahabah have better <br>deeds. <br>8. \t<br>Tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona. <br>In the tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona, seventy Sahabah were <br>massacred. All of them were Hafiz of Qur'an. Their Jama'at <br>was called the Jama'at of Qwaa and consisted mostly of <br>Ansaar. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) loved them <br>very much, for they engaged themselves in Zikr and recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an during the night, and attended upon the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his family during <br>the day. A person named Amir bin Malik and known as <br>Abu Bara, belonging to Bani Amir clan of Najd, came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took this Jama'at <br>with him for the Tabligh and the Ta'leem of his clan. The <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better <br>than of three.\" <br>'Amir bin Tufail was the nephew of 'Amir bin Malik, who <br>had brought the Jama'at. He was a bitter enemy of Islam <br>and hated the Muslims to the core. When Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) delivered the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) epistle to him, he did not even care to <br>read it and attacked Hadhrat Haraam (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>with his spear, which pierced through the latter's body. <br>Hadhrat Haraam (RadHiyallaho anho) uttered \"By the Lord <br>of the Ka'bah, I have triumphed,\" and died. The heartless <br>person had no consideration for the guarantee given by his <br>uncle, nor for the accepted tradition all over the world, that <br>nobody would kill the envoy. He then assembled the <br>people of his clan and exhorted them to kill all the Saha- <br>bah camping at Bi'r Ma'oona. The people hesitated, in view <br>of the guarantee given by 'Amir bin Malik. He collected a <br>large number of people from the neighbouring tribes and <br>attacked the Muslims. They massacred each one of them, <br>except Hadhrat Ka'b bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>had some life left in him and the enemy left him as dead. <br>Hadhrat <br>Munzir <br>and <br>Hadhrat <br>Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), while grazing the camels, noticed vultures hover-</p></div>"

He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time. I <br>cannot do that.\" <br>Saying this, he threw away the dates, and with sword in <br>hand jumped into the battle-field and fought till he was <br>killed. <br>In fact, these people appreciated the value of Paradise, <br>for their Yaqeen was firm. If we too get that Yaqeen in our <br>hearts, nothing will be too difficult or too much for us. <br>10. \t Hadhrat 'Umar's IRadhiyallaho anho) Emigration to <br>Madinah. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) is well known for <br>his valour and heroism by one and all. When the Muslims <br>were very weak in the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) prayed to Allah to strengthen the Mus- <br>lims with Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Islam. This <br>prayer was answered by Allah in no time, as we have seen <br>in Chapter I. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma'sood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"We could not say our Salaat in the Haram till %mar <br>had accepted Islam.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I \t<br>! <br>I <br>i</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was naturally very much upset when <br>the news reached him. He collected an army, 3 000-strong, <br>to advance against the enemy. While nominating Hadhrat <br>Zaid bin Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) to command the <br>army, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"If Zaid is killed, then Ja'far bin Abi Talib will be your <br>Amir and if he is also martyred, then Abdullah bin Ra- <br>wahah will take the command. If he also dies, then you <br>can select a commander from among yourselves.\" <br>A Jew, who was listening to this, said: <br>\"All the three must die. This is exactly how the earlier <br>Prophets used to prophesy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave Hadhrat <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) a white flag made by himself. He <br>then accompanied the army for some distance out of Madi- <br>nah and prayed for them saying: <br>\"May Allah bring you back safely and triumphantly. <br>May He guard you against all evils.\" <br>At that moment, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was o poet too. recited three couplets. <br>which meant: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred. We have never <br>fought by dint of our strength in arms and numbers. <br>We have always fought on the score of Islam, through <br>which Allah has exalted us. You are sure of one of the <br>two triumphs: Victory or Martyrdom.\" <br>Thus exhorted by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the Sahabah decided to advance till <br>they faced the Christian army in the battle-field of Moota. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with flag in his hand di- <br>rected the field operations. A fierce battle raged; Sharjeel's <br>brother was killed in action. Sharjeel himself fled from the <br>field and took shelter in a fort. He sent a message to the <br>Caesar, who immediately despatched for his help and an <br>army, which was 200 000-strong. The Muslims were fight- <br>ing against very heavy odds. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was killed and the flag was taken over by Hadhrat <br>Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho). He intentionally disabled his <br>horse to dispel any idea of returning home from the battle- <br>field. He then recited a few couplets, which meant: <br>\"0,people! What a beautiful place is Paradise. And <br>how happy is its approach! How fine and how cool is <br>its water. The Roman's doom is at hand, I must finish <br>them all.\" <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>With flag in one hand and sword in the other, he jumped .$<br>into the enemy lines. The enemy cut his right hand, which 8~<br>held the flag. He at once transferred it to his left. When that <br>was cut off, he held the flag in his teeth and supported it <br>with his bleeding arms. His body was cut into two by <br>somebody from behind and fell dead. He was thirty-three at <br>that time. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When we removed him from the battle-field, we <br>counted as many as ninety wounds on his body--all <br>on the front side.\" <br>When Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was eating <br>a piece of meat in a corner of the battle-field. He had been <br>hungry for three days. On hearing about Hadhrat Ja'far's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) death, he threw away that piece of <br>meat, saying to himself: <br>\"Abdullah! You are busy in eating. while Ja'far has <br>reached Paradise.\" <br>He took the flag and began to fight. His finger was severely <br>injured and hung loose. He put the hanging finger under <br>his foot and tore it off from the hand, and then rushed for- <br>ward. Knowing the Muslims were fighting against very <br>overwhelming odds, and his own weakness, made him <br>pause for a moment. He at once recovered from his despair <br>and said to himself: <br>\"0, Heart! what makes you tarry now? Is it for the love <br>of wife? If so, then I divorce her this very moment. Is it <br>for the slaves? Then I set them all free. Is it for the <br>garden? I give it over in Sadaqah. He then recited a few <br>couplets, which meant: '0,Abdullah! You have to go <br>down after all; whether you do it willingly or unwil- <br>lingly. You have had enough of peace. 0,you, who are <br>only a drop of dirty fluid! See how the disbelievers are <br>assaulting the Muslims. Why does Paradise not entice <br>you? Even if you are not killed in this battle, remem- <br>ber, you have to die one day.\" <br>He then got down from his horse. Meanwhile his cousin <br>brought him a slice of meat, sayin \"You have had neither <br>sleep nor food for so many days. %at thiranrftake a little <br>rest before you fight.\" He held the slice and was about to</p></div>"

He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>I<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings, <br>never lagged behind in propagating the faith, yet we treat <br>them as the worst among rulers because of the contrast <br>with the just and God-fearing rulers. He was the viceroy of <br>king Abdul Malik bin Marwan for Hijaz and Iraq. The king <br>lived in Damascus and Hajjaj had his headquarters at <br>Koofah. Saeed bin Jubair had fought against Hajjaj on the <br>side of Ibnul Ash-ath. After the defeat. Saeed (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) ran away and took asylum in Mecca. The Govern- <br>ment posted a very stern person as the Governor of Mecca, <br>with instructions to'arrest Saeed. The Governor assembled <br>all the people of Mecca and read before them the order of <br>Abdul Malik, which said: <br>\"Any person who gives shelter to Hadhrat Saeed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) shall meet the same fate as Hadhrat <br>Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) himself.\" <br>He then announced to the people: <br>\"By Allah, I must kill the person who gives shelter to <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullah alaih). His and his neigh- <br>bours houses shall be razed to the ground.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was arrested with great <br>difficulty and sent to Koofah. When he was brought before <br>Hajjaj, the following conversation took place:</p></div>"

In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam): <br>'How mu~h'?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Exactly one-half.' <br>By and by, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>along with his load. It transpired that he had brought <br>everything that he possessed. <br>This is what I heard: ' <br>The Prophet (Sa/lallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'What did you leave for your family, Abu Bakr?' <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'I have left Allah and his Prophet for them.' <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that on that day <br>he admitted to himself that he could never hope to surpass <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Allah says in his Holy Book. <br>\"Vie one with another in good works (V:48).\" <br>Such healthy emulation in sacrifice is therefore quite</p></div>"

This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well. Thereupon, I hurried as fast as I could to <br>my cousin, and, lo! in the meantime he had also joined <br>the other two. <br>j <br>U! jp,6! <br>Many an incident of such self-denial and heroic sacri- <br>fice is recorded in the books of Hadith. This is the last <br>word in self-sacrifice, that each dying person should forego <br>slaking his own thirst in favour of his other needy brother. <br>May Allah bless their souls with His choicest favours for <br>their sacrifice for others even at the time of death, when a <br>person has seldom the sense to make a choice. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) shroud: <br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dear uncle, <br>and one of his earliest supporters. Hadhrat Hamzah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) fell in Uhud, and the ruthless enemy bru- <br>tally cut off his nose, ears and vitals. He was ripped open, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it, she simply exclaimed, <br>'Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon' and offered a prayer <br>for his soul.\" <br>In another Hadith, Hadhrat ZuLair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself narrates the incident. He says: <br>\"We rnade out a woman drawing near the place where <br>the martyrs of Uhud had been gathered. On her close <br>approach, I recognised her to be my own mother. I ad-<br>vanced to stop her, but she proved to be too strong for <br>me. She thrust me aside, with the words, 'Leave me <br>alone.' Whgn I told her that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had prohibited her from seeing the <br>dead body, she at once desisted from her purpose and <br>explained. \"Hearing the news of my brother's death, I <br>have brought a couple of sheets for his shroud. Take <br>these sheets and make use of them.' We took the sheets <br>and had begun to enshroud the body, when the dead <br>body of an Ansari named Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) caught our eyes. It was also lying close by <br>in the same condition. We considered it a shame to <br>enshroud Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) in two <br>sheets, while the body of another Muslim brother lay <br>bare. We, therefore, decided to use one sheet each for <br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of <br>sympathy, equality and self-sacrifice? Is it not shameful on <br>our part that we, who call ourselves the followers of these <br>illustrious people, do not possess any of these qualities. <br>7. <br>The Story of the Goat's Head: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"One of the Sahabah received a goat's head as a pres- <br>ent. He thought of a neighbour who had a larger family <br>and was in greater need of it thar, himself, and pre- <br>sented the same to him. 'This brother, on receipt of the <br>present, recollected yet another person whom he con- <br>sidered even more deserving than himself, and sent on <br>the head to him. The goat's head is, thus, said to have <br>changed hands no less than seven times, and at last <br>came back to the original person from whom the circu- <br>lation had started.\" <br>We learn from the $tory how poor and needy the Saha- <br>bah usually were, and yet how they indeed preferred others <br>above themselves. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\" <br>The person: <br>\"Please mind your own business.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Do tell me please. May be that I can help you.\" <br>The Derson: <br>\"If you must know, inside there is my wife groaning <br>with labour pains.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Is there anybody else to attend her?\" <br>The person: <br>\"No one.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), thereupon, got up <br>and hurried homewards. He broached the subject to his <br>wife Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) thus: <br>\"Allah has brought you an opportunity to receive great <br>blessings.\" <br>Wife: <br>' <br>\"What is it, 0,Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br><br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with <br>cooking something which those people could eat. After <br>some time, Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>called out from inside the tent, <br>\"Amir-ul-Mominin, congratulate your friend on the <br>birth of a son.\" <br>The person was much embarrassed when he heard the ad- <br>dress of 'Amir-ul-Mominin' and realized the position of the <br>person who had been serving him.

This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well. Thereupon, I hurried as fast as I could to <br>my cousin, and, lo! in the meantime he had also joined <br>the other two. <br>j <br>U! jp,6! <br>Many an incident of such self-denial and heroic sacri- <br>fice is recorded in the books of Hadith. This is the last <br>word in self-sacrifice, that each dying person should forego <br>slaking his own thirst in favour of his other needy brother. <br>May Allah bless their souls with His choicest favours for <br>their sacrifice for others even at the time of death, when a <br>person has seldom the sense to make a choice. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) shroud: <br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dear uncle, <br>and one of his earliest supporters. Hadhrat Hamzah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) fell in Uhud, and the ruthless enemy bru- <br>tally cut off his nose, ears and vitals. He was ripped open, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it, she simply exclaimed, <br>'Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon' and offered a prayer <br>for his soul.\" <br>In another Hadith, Hadhrat ZuLair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself narrates the incident. He says: <br>\"We rnade out a woman drawing near the place where <br>the martyrs of Uhud had been gathered. On her close <br>approach, I recognised her to be my own mother. I ad-<br>vanced to stop her, but she proved to be too strong for <br>me. She thrust me aside, with the words, 'Leave me <br>alone.' Whgn I told her that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had prohibited her from seeing the <br>dead body, she at once desisted from her purpose and <br>explained. \"Hearing the news of my brother's death, I <br>have brought a couple of sheets for his shroud. Take <br>these sheets and make use of them.' We took the sheets <br>and had begun to enshroud the body, when the dead <br>body of an Ansari named Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) caught our eyes. It was also lying close by <br>in the same condition. We considered it a shame to <br>enshroud Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) in two <br>sheets, while the body of another Muslim brother lay <br>bare. We, therefore, decided to use one sheet each for</p></div>"

Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of <br>sympathy, equality and self-sacrifice? Is it not shameful on <br>our part that we, who call ourselves the followers of these <br>illustrious people, do not possess any of these qualities. <br>7. <br>The Story of the Goat's Head: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"One of the Sahabah received a goat's head as a pres- <br>ent. He thought of a neighbour who had a larger family <br>and was in greater need of it thar, himself, and pre- <br>sented the same to him. 'This brother, on receipt of the <br>present, recollected yet another person whom he con- <br>sidered even more deserving than himself, and sent on <br>the head to him. The goat's head is, thus, said to have <br>changed hands no less than seven times, and at last <br>came back to the original person from whom the circu- <br>lation had started.\" <br>We learn from the $tory how poor and needy the Saha- <br>bah usually were, and yet how they indeed preferred others <br>above themselves.</p></div>"

During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\" <br>The person: <br>\"Please mind your own business.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Do tell me please.

He broached the subject to his <br>wife Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) thus: <br>\"Allah has brought you an opportunity to receive great <br>blessings.\" <br>Wife: <br>' <br>\"What is it, 0,Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br><br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with <br>cooking something which those people could eat. After <br>some time, Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>called out from inside the tent, <br>\"Amir-ul-Mominin, congratulate your friend on the <br>birth of a son.\" <br>The person was much embarrassed when he heard the ad- <br>dress of 'Amir-ul-Mominin' and realized the position of the <br>person who had been serving him.

Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort.

I think it would be <br>best utilized if you distribute it among your own <br>heirs.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and acted <br>upon the Prophet's advice. <br>. <br>Are we prepared to part with any of our dear things for <br>l<br>the sake of Allah so quickly, after reading a verse of the <br>I <br>Qur'an or listening to a well-delivered sermon?</p></div>"

Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) reprimands his <br>servant: <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) was well <br>known for his piety and abstinence. He kept no money <br>with him, and likewise did not like others to hosrd it. He <br>was always fighting against the moneyed class. Hadhrat <br>Usman, (Radhiyallaho anho), therefore, during his caliph- <br>ate advised him to shift to Rabzah (a small village in the <br>desert). He had a few camels to live on, and an old servant <br>to look after them. A tribesman from Banu Sulaim onca <br>presented himself with a request: <br>\"I wish to stay with you to benefit from your knowl- <br>edge of Allah's commandments and the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) ways and habits; I shall also <br>help your servant in looking after the camels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"I cannot keep with me a person who does not comply <br>with my wishes; but if you can always do as bidden, <br>you may remain with me, else I wish good-bye to you.\" <br>The person asked: <br>\"In what way do you like me to carry out your <br>wishes.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"When I ask you to spend from my belongings, you are <br>required to spend the best of them.\" <br>The person says, \"I accepted Hadhrat Abuzar's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) condition and stayed on with him. One <br>day, somebody informed him that there were some poor <br>folk camping near the spring close-by and were in dire <br>need of food. He asked me to fetch a camel. Accordingly, I <br>went and intended to select the best of the lot, as I had <br>pledged to do. It was a very fine and submissive animal <br>and good for riding. so I decided to let it be, and selected <br>the second best, as after all it was only to be slaughtered <br>and eaten and, for this purpose, just as good as the other. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I: \t<br>'I did not forget you instructions, but thought it better <br>to preserve the one for transport duties, while the <br>other was as good for eating.' <br>Abuzar: 'Was it for my personal need that you left it?' <br>I: \t<br>'Yes.' <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Come, let me tell you the occasion of my needs. That <br>is the day when I shall be laid all alone in the solitude <br>of the grave. Remember, there are three partners in <br>your wealth, viz. (1)Your destiny, which does not wait <br>to take away its share. Good or bad it would take away <br>all that it has to take. (2) Your heirs, who are waiting <br>for the day of your death, so that they may take over <br>their share, and (3) Yourself. If you can manage, don't <br>be the most helpless of the three partners. Take your <br>full share, while you can. Allah says: <br>'Ye will not attain unto piety until you spend of tnat <br>. \t<br>which you love. (111: 92). I, therefore, think it advisable <br>to send in advance the things which I love best, so that <br>they may be in safe deposit for me there.' <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>u <br>Ch.

It is very <br>seldom that the heirs give away in the path of Allah the <br>wealth inherited from another person, so that his soul may <br>benefit by it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>remarked: <br>\"Man cherishes his worldly belongings, hugging them <br>to his soul, and gloating, 'my wealth, my wealth,' but <br>in reality only that much of it is his wealth, which he <br>either enjoys in the form of food or dress or spends in <br>the path of Allah to be stored up for him in the Here- <br>after. What is left of his wealth belongs to others; he is <br>only acting as a custodian.\" <br>In another Hadith, it is reported that once the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired of the Sahabah. <br>\"Which of you would rather like to see his wealth in <br>the hands of his heirs than keep it with himself?\" <br>They replied: \"Who would like to be such a person, 0<br>Prophet of Allah? (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex-<br>plained: <br>\"Whatever you send in advance by spending it in the <br>path of Allah is yours, and whatever is left behind be- <br>longs to your heirs.\" <br>11. The Story of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far and Hadhrat <br>.Abdullah Bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma): <br>Hadhrat Ja'far Tayyar (Radhiyallaho anho) is a cousin <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a brother of <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). His whole family is re- <br>nowned for magnanimity, generosity, valour and heroism, <br>but Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) had a special love <br>for the poor and often mingled and associated with them. <br>He emigrated to Abyssinia with the other Muslims at the <br>time of the persecution by Qureysh, and he was the spokes- <br>man who so successfully defended the emigrants in the <br>court of the Negus. This story we have already given in <br>Chapter I. After returning from Abyssinia, he emigrated to <br>Madinah and was martyred in the expedition of Mootah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity <br>just then and this grieved him very much. Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) purchased the whole lot through <br>his agent, and distributed it (free) among the people. He <br>always acted as a host to all the strangers who were <br>stranded in the city during the night. <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), when participat- <br>ing in his last battle, called his son Hadhrat Abdullah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to his side and confided to him that he had <br>a premonition that this was going to be his last fight, in <br>which he was destiried to fall, adding that if it turned out <br>to be so, Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) was to <br>clear all his debts. He further admonished his son to call <br>upon his 'Master' if he encountered any difficulty in doing <br>so. His son, a bit puzzled, inquired as to who his Master <br>was? \"Allah,\" replied Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>The same day he met his fate. When Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) checked the accounts of his <br>father, he discovered debts that amounted to no less than <br>two million dirhams. Having the reputation of being as <br>honest and trustworthy a person as any that ever breathed, <br>people flocked to him for the safe deposit of their money. <br>He invariably address them like this: <br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>8 <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money <br>was due to Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) from his father. He therefore went to him again and <br>said: <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Excuse me. It was my mistake. In fact my father owed <br>you that much money.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If that is the case, I remit the debt.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"No, I must pay it.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You may pay it at your convenience.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Will you accept some land in lieu thereof? (He had re- <br>ceived some land as his share of booty. and he wanted <br>to dispose of it.\") <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yes, if it suits you.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). says, \"I <br>made over to him a piece of waterless land. He asked his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual. <br><br>CHAPTER VII <br>VALOUR AND HEROISM <br>Fear of death was unknown to the Sahabah. They were <br>therefore most fearless and valorous. A person who can <br>look death in the face can meet all situations. There is left <br>for him no attraction in the wealth of this world, and no <br>fear of an enemy. I wish I could inherit this quality from <br>these true heroes. <br>1. \t Ibn Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) and Sa'd (Radhiyal- <br>laho d o )  Pray for Each Other: <br>On the eve'of Uhud, Abdullah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"0.Sa'd! come, let us pray together. Let each pray to <br>Allah for the grant of his sole desire, and the other <br>would say Ameen to it. This way, the praye:s are more <br>likely to be answered by Allah.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) agreed, and they both went to a <br>corner to pray. <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was first to pray, saying: <br>\"0,Allah, when the battle rages tomorrow, let me face <br>a very strong and fierce enemy. Let him attack me with <br>might and main, and let me repulse him with all my <br>strength. Then 0,Allah, let me be triumphant by kill- <br>ing him for your sake, and allow me to have his pos- <br>sessions as booty.\" <br>Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) said; \"Ameen .\" <br>Then Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anno) started his prayer, <br>saying: <br>\"0,Allah, let me face one of the toughest fighters <br>among the enemy tomorrow. Let him attack me with <br>full fury and let me attack him with my full strength. <br>Then let him have the upper hand and kill me. lie may <br>cut my nose and ears from my body. And when I <br>appear before You on the day of Judgement, You may <br>ask me, 'How did you lose your nose and ears, 0,Ab-<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2. Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) valour in Uhud: <br>Neglect of the Prophet's orders changed the victory at <br>Uhud into a defeat, the details of which we have already <br>seen in Chapter I. That was a very hard time for the Mus- <br>lims. They were simply caught between the two groups of <br>the enemy, and many were killed. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was surrounded by the enemy, who <br>spread the rumour that he had died. Most of the Sahabah <br>lost their balance of mind at this rumour, and that was the <br>main cause of their c6nfusion. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were surrounded by the enemy, and I could not <br>see the Prophet (sallalaho alaihe wasallam). I first sea- <br>rched for him among the living and then among the <br>I <br>dead, but I could not find him. I said to myself, 'It is <br>impossible for him to fly from the battle-field. It seems <br>that Allah is angry with us due to our sins, and He has <br>lifted him up to the heavens. There is no way left for <br>me except to jump into the enemy lines and fight till I <br>am killed.' I therefore attacked the enemy, clearing <br>them with my sword till I caught sight of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); I was very happy and was <br>sure that Allah had been protecting him through His <br><br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both.\" <br>Look at the valour of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He jumps into the enemy lines singlehanded, when he is <br>unable to find the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>This also shows his extreme love and devotion to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>3. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anhoj is martyred <br>When the battle of Uhud started, Hadhrat Hanzalah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had just been wedded and therefore <br>did not join the battle from the beginning. It is said that he <br>had just left the bed of his wife and had hardly started <br>taking his bath, when he heard somebody breaking the <br>news about the defeat. He postponed the bath and, with <br>sword in hand, rushed towards the battle-field. He jumped <br>into the enemy concentration, fighting and penetrating till <br>he was killed. Now the body of the person killed in the <br>path of Allah is not washed, unless a bath has been incum- <br>bent on him before his death. Not knowing his failure to <br>take the bath incumbent on him, the Sahabah buried him <br>without a wash. Just before his burial, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I see the angels washing Hanzalah's body.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>very much to join the battle. People said to him: <br>\"You ar excusable, as you are lame. You need not go <br>to the battle.\" <br>He replied: \t \"How sad! that my sons go to Paradise, and I <br>stay behind.\" <br>His wife also wanted him to fight and get martyred, so that <br>she might have the honour of being the widow of a martyr. <br>To exhort him, she said to him: <br>\"I do not believe that people have stopped you from <br>going. It seems that you are yourself afraid to go to the <br>battlefield.\" <br>Hearing this, Hadhrat 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) equipped <br>himself with arms and, facing Qiblah, prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>He then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said: <br>\"I had always wished for martyrdom, but my people <br>have always been stopping me from going into the <br><br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud, <br>again and again. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was informed of this, he said: <br>\"The camel is charged to do that. Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam. In the battle of <br>Uhud, Musab (Radhiyallaho anho) held the flag of Islam. <br>When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in <br>confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. <br>An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the <br>flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at <br>once took the flag in the other hand. The enemy then cut <br>the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with the <br>help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his <br>body with an arrow. He fell dead and, with him fell the flag <br>that he had not allowed to fall while he was alive. Another <br>Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, <br>he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too <br>short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the <br>feet would be exposed, and when it was drawn to cover the <br>feet, the head would become uncovered. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Cover his head with the sheet, and his feet with 'Azk-<br>har'leaves.\" <br>Such was the end of the youth who was brought up in <br>luxury and comfort. The person who used to wear a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams does not have sufficient cloth <br>to cover his dead body. Look! With what valour he tried to <br><br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind <br>in Madinah. Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was very <br>brave and considered to be one of the heroes of Arabia. Iraq <br>was a part of the Persian Empire and Yazdjard was the Em- <br>peror at that time. He sent for one of his best generals <br>named Rustam and charged him with the task of checking <br>the Muslim advance. Rustam tried to avoid going to the <br>front, because of the fear of the Muslims, and requested the <br>Emperor again and again to keep him back, saying: <br>\"I shall make arrangements for the despatch of re-<br>inforcements and shall be of use to your Majesty at the <br>time of counsel.\" <br>But the Emperor did not agree, and he had to go to the <br>battlefield. <br>When Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>leave Madinah, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gave <br>him the following instructions: <br>\"0,Sa'd! Let this fact not beguile you that you are one <br>of the trusted companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and that people call you his uncle. <br>Allah does not repel evil with evil, but He repels evil <br>with good. Allah has no relation with His creation. All <br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\" <br>Ask the people who are addicted to liquor, how much <br>they love to taste it. The Sahabah loved to meet death in <br>the Path of Allah even more. This was the chief cause of <br>their success. <br>7. \t Hadhrat Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) was a shepherd <br>and had been a ~usl\"lm for some time. He lived in his vil- <br>lage in the desert. He came to Madinah to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was accompanied by his <br>nephew and his herd of goats, which he had tied with a <br>rope. He learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was in Uhud. He left his goats and went to Uhud to <br>fight by the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). A group of the enemy was at that time advancing to <br>attack the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet announced: <br>b <br>\"The person who disperses these people will be my <br>companion in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) attacked them fiercely <br>and repulsed all of them. A second and third group of the <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>121 2 3  <br>0s<br>I<br>enemy tried to advance, and each time it was Hadhrat <br>.gs<br>Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) who fought them and put them <br>$ g<br>m<br>to flight single handed. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) gave him good tidings of Paradise. No sooner did <br>he hear this, than he jumped into the enemy lines and <br>fought till he was no more. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I have never seen a person fighting so bravely and <br>fearlessly as Wahb did. I saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) standing beside his dead body, <br>saying, '0Wahb! You have pleased me. May Allah be <br>pleased with you.\" <br>Although the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself <br>was wounded in this battle, yet he buried Wahb's body <br>with his own hands. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to say: <br>\"I never envied anybody more than Wahb (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho). I wish I could appear before Allah with a <br>record as good as his.\" <br>What is it in the life of Hadhrat Wahb (Radhivallaho <br>anho) that makes an illustrious and exalted person like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to envy him. It is the <br>same spirit of sacrifice for the sake of Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even though Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and other Sahabah have better <br>deeds. <br>8. \t<br>Tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona. <br>In the tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona, seventy Sahabah were <br>massacred. All of them were Hafiz of Qur'an. Their Jama'at <br>was called the Jama'at of Qwaa and consisted mostly of <br>Ansaar. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) loved them <br>very much, for they engaged themselves in Zikr and recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an during the night, and attended upon the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his family during <br>the day. A person named Amir bin Malik and known as <br>Abu Bara, belonging to Bani Amir clan of Najd, came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took this Jama'at <br>with him for the Tabligh and the Ta'leem of his clan. The <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better <br>than of three.\" <br>'Amir bin Tufail was the nephew of 'Amir bin Malik, who <br>had brought the Jama'at. He was a bitter enemy of Islam <br>and hated the Muslims to the core. When Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) delivered the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) epistle to him, he did not even care to <br>read it and attacked Hadhrat Haraam (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>with his spear, which pierced through the latter's body. <br>Hadhrat Haraam (RadHiyallaho anho) uttered \"By the Lord <br>of the Ka'bah, I have triumphed,\" and died. The heartless <br>person had no consideration for the guarantee given by his <br>uncle, nor for the accepted tradition all over the world, that <br>nobody would kill the envoy. He then assembled the <br>people of his clan and exhorted them to kill all the Saha- <br>bah camping at Bi'r Ma'oona. The people hesitated, in view <br>of the guarantee given by 'Amir bin Malik. He collected a <br>large number of people from the neighbouring tribes and <br>attacked the Muslims. They massacred each one of them, <br>except Hadhrat Ka'b bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>had some life left in him and the enemy left him as dead. <br>Hadhrat <br>Munzir <br>and <br>Hadhrat <br>Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), while grazing the camels, noticed vultures hover- <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made, 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) free and let him go. 'Amir bin Fuhairah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave of Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), was <br>also among those who were killed at Bi'r Ma'oona. Jabbar <br>bin Salmi, who killed him says: <br>When I thrust my spear through him, he uttered, 'By <br>Allah, I have triumphed and to my amazement I saw <br>his body lifted upwards towards the sky. I made enqui- <br>ries later on as to what was the triumph that 'Amir bin <br>Fuhairah (Radhiyallaho anho) meant when he uttered, <br>'By Allah, I have triumphed.' I was told that it was that <br>of entering into Paradise. This made me embrace <br>Islam. <br>These are the illustrious people, of whom Islam is <br>rightly proud. Death had really more attraction for them <br>than wine for their enemies. As they did deeds which were <br>sure to win Allah's pleasure, they felt most triumphant at <br>the time of surrendering their souls. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up Eating <br>Dates. <br>In Badr, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>sitting in a tent. He exhorted the Sahabah to fight, saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time. I <br>cannot do that.\" <br>Saying this, he threw away the dates, and with sword in <br>hand jumped into the battle-field and fought till he was <br>killed. <br>In fact, these people appreciated the value of Paradise, <br>for their Yaqeen was firm. If we too get that Yaqeen in our <br>hearts, nothing will be too difficult or too much for us. <br>10. \t Hadhrat 'Umar's IRadhiyallaho anho) Emigration to <br>Madinah. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) is well known for <br>his valour and heroism by one and all. When the Muslims <br>were very weak in the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) prayed to Allah to strengthen the Mus- <br>lims with Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Islam. This <br>prayer was answered by Allah in no time, as we have seen <br>in Chapter I. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma'sood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"We could not say our Salaat in the Haram till %mar <br>had accepted Islam.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I \t<br>! <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was naturally very much upset when <br>the news reached him. He collected an army, 3 000-strong, <br>to advance against the enemy. While nominating Hadhrat <br>Zaid bin Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) to command the <br>army, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"If Zaid is killed, then Ja'far bin Abi Talib will be your <br>Amir and if he is also martyred, then Abdullah bin Ra- <br>wahah will take the command. If he also dies, then you <br>can select a commander from among yourselves.\" <br>A Jew, who was listening to this, said: <br>\"All the three must die. This is exactly how the earlier <br>Prophets used to prophesy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave Hadhrat <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) a white flag made by himself. He <br>then accompanied the army for some distance out of Madi- <br>nah and prayed for them saying: <br>\"May Allah bring you back safely and triumphantly. <br>May He guard you against all evils.\" <br>At that moment, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was o poet too. recited three couplets. <br>which meant: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred. We have never <br>fought by dint of our strength in arms and numbers. <br>We have always fought on the score of Islam, through <br>which Allah has exalted us. You are sure of one of the <br>two triumphs: Victory or Martyrdom.\" <br>Thus exhorted by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the Sahabah decided to advance till <br>they faced the Christian army in the battle-field of Moota. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with flag in his hand di- <br>rected the field operations. A fierce battle raged; Sharjeel's <br>brother was killed in action. Sharjeel himself fled from the <br>field and took shelter in a fort. He sent a message to the <br>Caesar, who immediately despatched for his help and an <br>army, which was 200 000-strong. The Muslims were fight- <br>ing against very heavy odds. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was killed and the flag was taken over by Hadhrat <br>Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho). He intentionally disabled his <br>horse to dispel any idea of returning home from the battle- <br>field. He then recited a few couplets, which meant: <br>\"0,people! What a beautiful place is Paradise. And <br>how happy is its approach! How fine and how cool is <br>its water. The Roman's doom is at hand, I must finish <br>them all.\" <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>With flag in one hand and sword in the other, he jumped .$<br>into the enemy lines. The enemy cut his right hand, which 8~<br>held the flag. He at once transferred it to his left. When that <br>was cut off, he held the flag in his teeth and supported it <br>with his bleeding arms. His body was cut into two by <br>somebody from behind and fell dead. He was thirty-three at <br>that time. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When we removed him from the battle-field, we <br>counted as many as ninety wounds on his body--all <br>on the front side.\" <br>When Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was eating <br>a piece of meat in a corner of the battle-field. He had been <br>hungry for three days. On hearing about Hadhrat Ja'far's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) death, he threw away that piece of <br>meat, saying to himself: <br>\"Abdullah! You are busy in eating. while Ja'far has <br>reached Paradise.\" <br>He took the flag and began to fight. His finger was severely <br>injured and hung loose. He put the hanging finger under <br>his foot and tore it off from the hand, and then rushed for- <br>ward. Knowing the Muslims were fighting against very <br>overwhelming odds, and his own weakness, made him <br>pause for a moment. He at once recovered from his despair <br>and said to himself: <br>\"0, Heart! what makes you tarry now? Is it for the love <br>of wife? If so, then I divorce her this very moment. Is it <br>for the slaves? Then I set them all free. Is it for the <br>garden? I give it over in Sadaqah. He then recited a few <br>couplets, which meant: '0,Abdullah! You have to go <br>down after all; whether you do it willingly or unwil- <br>lingly. You have had enough of peace. 0,you, who are <br>only a drop of dirty fluid! See how the disbelievers are <br>assaulting the Muslims. Why does Paradise not entice <br>you? Even if you are not killed in this battle, remem- <br>ber, you have to die one day.\" <br>He then got down from his horse. Meanwhile his cousin <br>brought him a slice of meat, sayin \"You have had neither <br>sleep nor food for so many days. %at thiranrftake a little <br>rest before you fight.\" He held the slice and was about to <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>I<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings, <br>never lagged behind in propagating the faith, yet we treat <br>them as the worst among rulers because of the contrast <br>with the just and God-fearing rulers. He was the viceroy of <br>king Abdul Malik bin Marwan for Hijaz and Iraq. The king <br>lived in Damascus and Hajjaj had his headquarters at <br>Koofah. Saeed bin Jubair had fought against Hajjaj on the <br>side of Ibnul Ash-ath. After the defeat. Saeed (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) ran away and took asylum in Mecca. The Govern- <br>ment posted a very stern person as the Governor of Mecca, <br>with instructions to'arrest Saeed. The Governor assembled <br>all the people of Mecca and read before them the order of <br>Abdul Malik, which said: <br>\"Any person who gives shelter to Hadhrat Saeed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) shall meet the same fate as Hadhrat <br>Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) himself.\" <br>He then announced to the people: <br>\"By Allah, I must kill the person who gives shelter to <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullah alaih). His and his neigh- <br>bours houses shall be razed to the ground.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was arrested with great <br>difficulty and sent to Koofah. When he was brought before <br>Hajjaj, the following conversation took place: <br><br>Ch. VII:, Valour and Heroism <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My name is Saeed (lit. auspicious).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your father's name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Jubair (lit. Trimmed).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"No, you are in fact Shaqi (lit. wretched) <br>son of Kusair (lit. a broken thing).\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My mother knew my name better than <br>you do.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"You are wretched and your mother is also <br>wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The Knower of the hidden things is <br>Hajjaj: <br>-<br>someone else\" <br>\"Look! I am putting you to sword.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Then my mother was right in giving me <br>this name.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I shall send you to Hell.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"If I knew that you had that power. <br>would have taken you as my god.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"What is your belief about the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"He was an apostle of Mercy and a <br>Prophet of Allah, sent'with the best Guid- <br>ance for the whole creation.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What do you say about the Khalifas?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not a warder over them. Everybody <br>is responsiLle for his own actions.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Who is the most exalted of the four Khali- <br>. fahs?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The one who had been able to please <br>. Allah more than the rest.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Which of them had 'been able to please <br>Allah more than the rest?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"This is known only to Him Who knows <br>what is hidden in the bosoms and what <br>the hearts conceal.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem- <br>peraments.\" <br>\"I am now going to kill you.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The time and mode of my death have <br>already been decreed.\" <br>~ a j j a j  <br>\"Allah has preferred me to you.\" <br>f <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Nobody can be proud of his relation with <br>Allfh, unless he knows his position; and <br>Allah is the only knower of the unseen.\" <br>\"Why should I not be proud of my relation <br>Hajjaj: <br>with Allah, when I am with the Amir-ul- <br>Mominin and you are with the rebels.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am with the other Muslims. I myself <br>shun mischief, but nobody can change the <br>decree of Allah.\" <br>\"What do y0.u say about what we collect <br>Hajjaj: <br>for Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do-not know what you collect for him.\" <br>Hajjaj sent for gold, silver and dresses fiom the trea- <br>sury and showed these to Saeed. <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>131 sc <br>%2 <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"These are useful, provided you are able to <br>obtain with them the things that may pro- <br>-84 <br>$,<br>vide you peace on the Day of Consterna- <br>tion (i.e Day of Judgement), when every <br>nursing mother will forget her nursing, <br>and every pregnant one will be delivered <br>of her burden, and when nothing but good <br>will be of any avail.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Are our collections not good?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"You have collected them, and you are the <br>best judge.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Do you like any of these things for your- <br>self?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I only like the things which Allah likes.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Woe to you!\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Woe is for the person who is deprived of <br>Paradise and is made to enter Hell.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>(Annoyed): \"Say how should I kill you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"As you would like to be killed.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Should I forgive you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah's forgiveness is real. Your aforgive- <br>ness is of no value.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>(To the executioner): \"Kill this man.\" <br>Hadhrat, Saeed laughed while he was being taken for <br>execution. Hajjaj was informed of this. He called him back. <br>\"What made you laugh?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Your boldness with Allah, and His,clem- <br>ency to you. \" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I am killing a person who has caused dis- <br>sent among the Muslims. (To the ex-<br>ecutioner) Kill him in front of me.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Let me say my Salaat of two rakaats.\" <br>After finishing Salaat, he faced Qiblah and recited: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts. <br>\"Make him lie on his face. We are only re- <br>Hajjaj: <br>sponsible for appearance.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was made to lie on his <br>face. <br>Saeed: <br>\"Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return <br>you, and thqnce We bring you forth a second time.\" <br>(XX:55). <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Kill him\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: I call you to witness what I recite: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, who <br>is all alone and Who has no partner and I bear witness <br>that Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is His <br>slave and His Prophet.\" <br><br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path. <br><br>CHAPTER-VIII <br>ZEAL FOR KNOWLEDGE <br>The Kalimah is the essence of Islam and the basis for <br>all achievements. No good action is acceptable with out <br>belief in Kalimah. The Sahabah, therefore, devoted most of <br>their energy, specially in the early days of Islam, to the <br>propagation of the Kalimah and to fighting with the forces <br>that resisted it. Although their engagements left them very <br>little time to drink deep from the ocean of learning with the <br>single-mindedness demanded thereof, yet their zeal even in <br>this direction has left us a legacy in the form of knowledge <br>about the Qur'an and Hadith, which is quite highly credita- <br>ble and a glaring example. When Sahabah go) a little lei- <br>sure from the work that kept them engtiged in the <br>beginning of Islam, and also when the number of people in <br>Islam grew considerably. Allah revealed the following <br>verse in the Qur'an: <br>\"And the believers should not all go out (in the path of <br>Allah). Of every group of them, a party only should go <br>forth that they (who are left behind) may gain sound <br>knowledge in feligion and that they may warn their <br>folk when they come to them, so that they may <br>beware.\" <br>(IX: 122). <br>Hadhrat ~bdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The verses of the Qur'an which were revealed in the <br>beginning of Islam, demanding every Muslim to move <br>out in the path of Allah; for example: <br>\"If you go not forth, He will afflict you with a painful <br>doom; <br>(IX:39)\"</p></div>"

VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>'Go forth, light and heavily armed, and strive with f 3  <br>your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah; <br>s m  <br>m<br>(IX:41).' <br>These verses were later on superceded by the foregoing <br>verse, which advised only a party from each group to leave <br>their places. <br>The Sahabah, very few in number as they were, had to <br>assume the responsibilities of Islam in all fields. Allah <br>therefore endowed them with the versatility that was <br>theirs. After the Sahabah, the Islam spread far and wide <br>and the Mu~lims swelled in number. Again, the later <br>people lacked the versatility of the Sahabah. Allah then <br>caused different people to specialize in different branches <br>of Islamic learning. Mohaddit.hin were to devote them- <br>selves to the collection and propagation of Hadith. Simi- <br>larly the Fuqaha (jurists) Soofia (Experts in Zikr), Qurraa <br>(Experts in recitation of Qur'an), Mujahidin (Fighters in the <br>path of Allah), etc, each own group had its own field to <br>take up as a whole-time task. This was very necessary at <br>that time, for otherwise different branches of Islamic learn- <br>ing would not have developed so nicely, as it is difficult for <br>one man to specialize in all the branches. The Prophets <br>(alaihimus salaam), and specially Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) the chief among them, were specially en- <br>dowed with such a capacity. This will explain why the <br>stories of other eminent personalities, besides the Sahabah <br>have also been narrated in this chapter. <br>1. Sahabah's Panel for Fatwa. <br>Although all the Sahabah, along with their engagement <br>in Jihad and propagation of faith, were devoted to acquir- <br>ing and further spreading of knowledge, yet there was a <br>panel of Sahabah who were exclusively entrusted with <br>Fatwa, even during the life tirne of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The panel comprised the following Saha- <br>bah:-<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr, Hadhrat 'Umar, Hadhrat Usman, <br>Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf. Hadhrat</p></div>"

It is very <br>seldom that the heirs give away in the path of Allah the <br>wealth inherited from another person, so that his soul may <br>benefit by it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>remarked: <br>\"Man cherishes his worldly belongings, hugging them <br>to his soul, and gloating, 'my wealth, my wealth,' but <br>in reality only that much of it is his wealth, which he <br>either enjoys in the form of food or dress or spends in <br>the path of Allah to be stored up for him in the Here- <br>after. What is left of his wealth belongs to others; he is <br>only acting as a custodian.\" <br>In another Hadith, it is reported that once the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired of the Sahabah. <br>\"Which of you would rather like to see his wealth in <br>the hands of his heirs than keep it with himself?\" <br>They replied: \"Who would like to be such a person, 0<br>Prophet of Allah? (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex-<br>plained: <br>\"Whatever you send in advance by spending it in the <br>path of Allah is yours, and whatever is left behind be- <br>longs to your heirs.\" <br>11. The Story of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far and Hadhrat <br>.Abdullah Bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma): <br>Hadhrat Ja'far Tayyar (Radhiyallaho anho) is a cousin <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a brother of <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). His whole family is re- <br>nowned for magnanimity, generosity, valour and heroism, <br>but Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) had a special love <br>for the poor and often mingled and associated with them. <br>He emigrated to Abyssinia with the other Muslims at the <br>time of the persecution by Qureysh, and he was the spokes- <br>man who so successfully defended the emigrants in the <br>court of the Negus. This story we have already given in <br>Chapter I. After returning from Abyssinia, he emigrated to <br>Madinah and was martyred in the expedition of Mootah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity <br>just then and this grieved him very much. Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) purchased the whole lot through <br>his agent, and distributed it (free) among the people. He <br>always acted as a host to all the strangers who were <br>stranded in the city during the night. <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), when participat- <br>ing in his last battle, called his son Hadhrat Abdullah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to his side and confided to him that he had <br>a premonition that this was going to be his last fight, in <br>which he was destiried to fall, adding that if it turned out <br>to be so, Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) was to <br>clear all his debts. He further admonished his son to call <br>upon his 'Master' if he encountered any difficulty in doing <br>so. His son, a bit puzzled, inquired as to who his Master <br>was? \"Allah,\" replied Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>The same day he met his fate. When Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) checked the accounts of his <br>father, he discovered debts that amounted to no less than <br>two million dirhams. Having the reputation of being as <br>honest and trustworthy a person as any that ever breathed, <br>people flocked to him for the safe deposit of their money. <br>He invariably address them like this: <br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>8 <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money <br>was due to Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) from his father. He therefore went to him again and <br>said: <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Excuse me. It was my mistake. In fact my father owed <br>you that much money.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If that is the case, I remit the debt.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"No, I must pay it.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You may pay it at your convenience.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Will you accept some land in lieu thereof? (He had re- <br>ceived some land as his share of booty. and he wanted <br>to dispose of it.\") <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yes, if it suits you.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). says, \"I <br>made over to him a piece of waterless land. He asked his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual. <br><br>CHAPTER VII <br>VALOUR AND HEROISM <br>Fear of death was unknown to the Sahabah. They were <br>therefore most fearless and valorous. A person who can <br>look death in the face can meet all situations. There is left <br>for him no attraction in the wealth of this world, and no <br>fear of an enemy. I wish I could inherit this quality from <br>these true heroes. <br>1. \t Ibn Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) and Sa'd (Radhiyal- <br>laho d o )  Pray for Each Other: <br>On the eve'of Uhud, Abdullah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"0.Sa'd! come, let us pray together. Let each pray to <br>Allah for the grant of his sole desire, and the other <br>would say Ameen to it. This way, the praye:s are more <br>likely to be answered by Allah.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) agreed, and they both went to a <br>corner to pray. <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was first to pray, saying: <br>\"0,Allah, when the battle rages tomorrow, let me face <br>a very strong and fierce enemy. Let him attack me with <br>might and main, and let me repulse him with all my <br>strength. Then 0,Allah, let me be triumphant by kill- <br>ing him for your sake, and allow me to have his pos- <br>sessions as booty.\" <br>Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) said; \"Ameen .\" <br>Then Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anno) started his prayer, <br>saying: <br>\"0,Allah, let me face one of the toughest fighters <br>among the enemy tomorrow. Let him attack me with <br>full fury and let me attack him with my full strength. <br>Then let him have the upper hand and kill me. lie may <br>cut my nose and ears from my body. And when I <br>appear before You on the day of Judgement, You may <br>ask me, 'How did you lose your nose and ears, 0,Ab-<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2. Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) valour in Uhud: <br>Neglect of the Prophet's orders changed the victory at <br>Uhud into a defeat, the details of which we have already <br>seen in Chapter I. That was a very hard time for the Mus- <br>lims. They were simply caught between the two groups of <br>the enemy, and many were killed. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was surrounded by the enemy, who <br>spread the rumour that he had died. Most of the Sahabah <br>lost their balance of mind at this rumour, and that was the <br>main cause of their c6nfusion. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were surrounded by the enemy, and I could not <br>see the Prophet (sallalaho alaihe wasallam). I first sea- <br>rched for him among the living and then among the <br>I <br>dead, but I could not find him. I said to myself, 'It is <br>impossible for him to fly from the battle-field. It seems <br>that Allah is angry with us due to our sins, and He has <br>lifted him up to the heavens. There is no way left for <br>me except to jump into the enemy lines and fight till I <br>am killed.' I therefore attacked the enemy, clearing <br>them with my sword till I caught sight of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); I was very happy and was <br>sure that Allah had been protecting him through His <br><br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both.\" <br>Look at the valour of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He jumps into the enemy lines singlehanded, when he is <br>unable to find the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>This also shows his extreme love and devotion to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>3. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anhoj is martyred <br>When the battle of Uhud started, Hadhrat Hanzalah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had just been wedded and therefore <br>did not join the battle from the beginning. It is said that he <br>had just left the bed of his wife and had hardly started <br>taking his bath, when he heard somebody breaking the <br>news about the defeat. He postponed the bath and, with <br>sword in hand, rushed towards the battle-field. He jumped <br>into the enemy concentration, fighting and penetrating till <br>he was killed. Now the body of the person killed in the <br>path of Allah is not washed, unless a bath has been incum- <br>bent on him before his death. Not knowing his failure to <br>take the bath incumbent on him, the Sahabah buried him <br>without a wash. Just before his burial, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I see the angels washing Hanzalah's body.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>very much to join the battle. People said to him: <br>\"You ar excusable, as you are lame. You need not go <br>to the battle.\" <br>He replied: \t \"How sad! that my sons go to Paradise, and I <br>stay behind.\" <br>His wife also wanted him to fight and get martyred, so that <br>she might have the honour of being the widow of a martyr. <br>To exhort him, she said to him: <br>\"I do not believe that people have stopped you from <br>going. It seems that you are yourself afraid to go to the <br>battlefield.\" <br>Hearing this, Hadhrat 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) equipped <br>himself with arms and, facing Qiblah, prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>He then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said: <br>\"I had always wished for martyrdom, but my people <br>have always been stopping me from going into the <br><br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud, <br>again and again. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was informed of this, he said: <br>\"The camel is charged to do that. Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam. In the battle of <br>Uhud, Musab (Radhiyallaho anho) held the flag of Islam. <br>When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in <br>confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. <br>An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the <br>flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at <br>once took the flag in the other hand. The enemy then cut <br>the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with the <br>help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his <br>body with an arrow. He fell dead and, with him fell the flag <br>that he had not allowed to fall while he was alive. Another <br>Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, <br>he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too <br>short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the <br>feet would be exposed, and when it was drawn to cover the <br>feet, the head would become uncovered. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Cover his head with the sheet, and his feet with 'Azk-<br>har'leaves.\" <br>Such was the end of the youth who was brought up in <br>luxury and comfort. The person who used to wear a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams does not have sufficient cloth <br>to cover his dead body. Look! With what valour he tried to <br><br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind <br>in Madinah. Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was very <br>brave and considered to be one of the heroes of Arabia. Iraq <br>was a part of the Persian Empire and Yazdjard was the Em- <br>peror at that time. He sent for one of his best generals <br>named Rustam and charged him with the task of checking <br>the Muslim advance. Rustam tried to avoid going to the <br>front, because of the fear of the Muslims, and requested the <br>Emperor again and again to keep him back, saying: <br>\"I shall make arrangements for the despatch of re-<br>inforcements and shall be of use to your Majesty at the <br>time of counsel.\" <br>But the Emperor did not agree, and he had to go to the <br>battlefield. <br>When Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>leave Madinah, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gave <br>him the following instructions: <br>\"0,Sa'd! Let this fact not beguile you that you are one <br>of the trusted companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and that people call you his uncle. <br>Allah does not repel evil with evil, but He repels evil <br>with good. Allah has no relation with His creation. All <br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\" <br>Ask the people who are addicted to liquor, how much <br>they love to taste it. The Sahabah loved to meet death in <br>the Path of Allah even more. This was the chief cause of <br>their success. <br>7. \t Hadhrat Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) was a shepherd <br>and had been a ~usl\"lm for some time. He lived in his vil- <br>lage in the desert. He came to Madinah to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was accompanied by his <br>nephew and his herd of goats, which he had tied with a <br>rope. He learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was in Uhud. He left his goats and went to Uhud to <br>fight by the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). A group of the enemy was at that time advancing to <br>attack the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet announced: <br>b <br>\"The person who disperses these people will be my <br>companion in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) attacked them fiercely <br>and repulsed all of them. A second and third group of the <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>121 2 3  <br>0s<br>I<br>enemy tried to advance, and each time it was Hadhrat <br>.gs<br>Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) who fought them and put them <br>$ g<br>m<br>to flight single handed. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) gave him good tidings of Paradise. No sooner did <br>he hear this, than he jumped into the enemy lines and <br>fought till he was no more. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I have never seen a person fighting so bravely and <br>fearlessly as Wahb did. I saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) standing beside his dead body, <br>saying, '0Wahb! You have pleased me. May Allah be <br>pleased with you.\" <br>Although the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself <br>was wounded in this battle, yet he buried Wahb's body <br>with his own hands. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to say: <br>\"I never envied anybody more than Wahb (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho). I wish I could appear before Allah with a <br>record as good as his.\" <br>What is it in the life of Hadhrat Wahb (Radhivallaho <br>anho) that makes an illustrious and exalted person like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to envy him. It is the <br>same spirit of sacrifice for the sake of Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even though Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and other Sahabah have better <br>deeds. <br>8. \t<br>Tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona. <br>In the tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona, seventy Sahabah were <br>massacred. All of them were Hafiz of Qur'an. Their Jama'at <br>was called the Jama'at of Qwaa and consisted mostly of <br>Ansaar. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) loved them <br>very much, for they engaged themselves in Zikr and recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an during the night, and attended upon the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his family during <br>the day. A person named Amir bin Malik and known as <br>Abu Bara, belonging to Bani Amir clan of Najd, came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took this Jama'at <br>with him for the Tabligh and the Ta'leem of his clan. The <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better <br>than of three.\" <br>'Amir bin Tufail was the nephew of 'Amir bin Malik, who <br>had brought the Jama'at. He was a bitter enemy of Islam <br>and hated the Muslims to the core. When Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) delivered the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) epistle to him, he did not even care to <br>read it and attacked Hadhrat Haraam (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>with his spear, which pierced through the latter's body. <br>Hadhrat Haraam (RadHiyallaho anho) uttered \"By the Lord <br>of the Ka'bah, I have triumphed,\" and died. The heartless <br>person had no consideration for the guarantee given by his <br>uncle, nor for the accepted tradition all over the world, that <br>nobody would kill the envoy. He then assembled the <br>people of his clan and exhorted them to kill all the Saha- <br>bah camping at Bi'r Ma'oona. The people hesitated, in view <br>of the guarantee given by 'Amir bin Malik. He collected a <br>large number of people from the neighbouring tribes and <br>attacked the Muslims. They massacred each one of them, <br>except Hadhrat Ka'b bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>had some life left in him and the enemy left him as dead. <br>Hadhrat <br>Munzir <br>and <br>Hadhrat <br>Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), while grazing the camels, noticed vultures hover- <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made, 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) free and let him go. 'Amir bin Fuhairah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave of Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), was <br>also among those who were killed at Bi'r Ma'oona. Jabbar <br>bin Salmi, who killed him says: <br>When I thrust my spear through him, he uttered, 'By <br>Allah, I have triumphed and to my amazement I saw <br>his body lifted upwards towards the sky. I made enqui- <br>ries later on as to what was the triumph that 'Amir bin <br>Fuhairah (Radhiyallaho anho) meant when he uttered, <br>'By Allah, I have triumphed.' I was told that it was that <br>of entering into Paradise. This made me embrace <br>Islam. <br>These are the illustrious people, of whom Islam is <br>rightly proud. Death had really more attraction for them <br>than wine for their enemies. As they did deeds which were <br>sure to win Allah's pleasure, they felt most triumphant at <br>the time of surrendering their souls. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up Eating <br>Dates. <br>In Badr, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>sitting in a tent. He exhorted the Sahabah to fight, saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time. I <br>cannot do that.\" <br>Saying this, he threw away the dates, and with sword in <br>hand jumped into the battle-field and fought till he was <br>killed. <br>In fact, these people appreciated the value of Paradise, <br>for their Yaqeen was firm. If we too get that Yaqeen in our <br>hearts, nothing will be too difficult or too much for us. <br>10. \t Hadhrat 'Umar's IRadhiyallaho anho) Emigration to <br>Madinah. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) is well known for <br>his valour and heroism by one and all. When the Muslims <br>were very weak in the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) prayed to Allah to strengthen the Mus- <br>lims with Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Islam. This <br>prayer was answered by Allah in no time, as we have seen <br>in Chapter I. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma'sood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"We could not say our Salaat in the Haram till %mar <br>had accepted Islam.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I \t<br>! <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was naturally very much upset when <br>the news reached him. He collected an army, 3 000-strong, <br>to advance against the enemy. While nominating Hadhrat <br>Zaid bin Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) to command the <br>army, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"If Zaid is killed, then Ja'far bin Abi Talib will be your <br>Amir and if he is also martyred, then Abdullah bin Ra- <br>wahah will take the command. If he also dies, then you <br>can select a commander from among yourselves.\" <br>A Jew, who was listening to this, said: <br>\"All the three must die. This is exactly how the earlier <br>Prophets used to prophesy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave Hadhrat <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) a white flag made by himself. He <br>then accompanied the army for some distance out of Madi- <br>nah and prayed for them saying: <br>\"May Allah bring you back safely and triumphantly. <br>May He guard you against all evils.\" <br>At that moment, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was o poet too. recited three couplets. <br>which meant: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred. We have never <br>fought by dint of our strength in arms and numbers. <br>We have always fought on the score of Islam, through <br>which Allah has exalted us. You are sure of one of the <br>two triumphs: Victory or Martyrdom.\" <br>Thus exhorted by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the Sahabah decided to advance till <br>they faced the Christian army in the battle-field of Moota. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with flag in his hand di- <br>rected the field operations. A fierce battle raged; Sharjeel's <br>brother was killed in action. Sharjeel himself fled from the <br>field and took shelter in a fort. He sent a message to the <br>Caesar, who immediately despatched for his help and an <br>army, which was 200 000-strong. The Muslims were fight- <br>ing against very heavy odds. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was killed and the flag was taken over by Hadhrat <br>Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho). He intentionally disabled his <br>horse to dispel any idea of returning home from the battle- <br>field. He then recited a few couplets, which meant: <br>\"0,people! What a beautiful place is Paradise. And <br>how happy is its approach! How fine and how cool is <br>its water. The Roman's doom is at hand, I must finish <br>them all.\" <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>With flag in one hand and sword in the other, he jumped .$<br>into the enemy lines. The enemy cut his right hand, which 8~<br>held the flag. He at once transferred it to his left. When that <br>was cut off, he held the flag in his teeth and supported it <br>with his bleeding arms. His body was cut into two by <br>somebody from behind and fell dead. He was thirty-three at <br>that time. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When we removed him from the battle-field, we <br>counted as many as ninety wounds on his body--all <br>on the front side.\" <br>When Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was eating <br>a piece of meat in a corner of the battle-field. He had been <br>hungry for three days. On hearing about Hadhrat Ja'far's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) death, he threw away that piece of <br>meat, saying to himself: <br>\"Abdullah! You are busy in eating. while Ja'far has <br>reached Paradise.\" <br>He took the flag and began to fight. His finger was severely <br>injured and hung loose. He put the hanging finger under <br>his foot and tore it off from the hand, and then rushed for- <br>ward. Knowing the Muslims were fighting against very <br>overwhelming odds, and his own weakness, made him <br>pause for a moment. He at once recovered from his despair <br>and said to himself: <br>\"0, Heart! what makes you tarry now? Is it for the love <br>of wife? If so, then I divorce her this very moment. Is it <br>for the slaves? Then I set them all free. Is it for the <br>garden? I give it over in Sadaqah. He then recited a few <br>couplets, which meant: '0,Abdullah! You have to go <br>down after all; whether you do it willingly or unwil- <br>lingly. You have had enough of peace. 0,you, who are <br>only a drop of dirty fluid! See how the disbelievers are <br>assaulting the Muslims. Why does Paradise not entice <br>you? Even if you are not killed in this battle, remem- <br>ber, you have to die one day.\" <br>He then got down from his horse. Meanwhile his cousin <br>brought him a slice of meat, sayin \"You have had neither <br>sleep nor food for so many days. %at thiranrftake a little <br>rest before you fight.\" He held the slice and was about to <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>I<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings, <br>never lagged behind in propagating the faith, yet we treat <br>them as the worst among rulers because of the contrast <br>with the just and God-fearing rulers. He was the viceroy of <br>king Abdul Malik bin Marwan for Hijaz and Iraq. The king <br>lived in Damascus and Hajjaj had his headquarters at <br>Koofah. Saeed bin Jubair had fought against Hajjaj on the <br>side of Ibnul Ash-ath. After the defeat. Saeed (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) ran away and took asylum in Mecca. The Govern- <br>ment posted a very stern person as the Governor of Mecca, <br>with instructions to'arrest Saeed. The Governor assembled <br>all the people of Mecca and read before them the order of <br>Abdul Malik, which said: <br>\"Any person who gives shelter to Hadhrat Saeed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) shall meet the same fate as Hadhrat <br>Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) himself.\" <br>He then announced to the people: <br>\"By Allah, I must kill the person who gives shelter to <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullah alaih). His and his neigh- <br>bours houses shall be razed to the ground.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was arrested with great <br>difficulty and sent to Koofah. When he was brought before <br>Hajjaj, the following conversation took place: <br><br>Ch. VII:, Valour and Heroism <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My name is Saeed (lit. auspicious).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your father's name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Jubair (lit. Trimmed).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"No, you are in fact Shaqi (lit. wretched) <br>son of Kusair (lit. a broken thing).\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My mother knew my name better than <br>you do.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"You are wretched and your mother is also <br>wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The Knower of the hidden things is <br>Hajjaj: <br>-<br>someone else\" <br>\"Look! I am putting you to sword.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Then my mother was right in giving me <br>this name.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I shall send you to Hell.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"If I knew that you had that power. <br>would have taken you as my god.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"What is your belief about the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"He was an apostle of Mercy and a <br>Prophet of Allah, sent'with the best Guid- <br>ance for the whole creation.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What do you say about the Khalifas?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not a warder over them. Everybody <br>is responsiLle for his own actions.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Who is the most exalted of the four Khali- <br>. fahs?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The one who had been able to please <br>. Allah more than the rest.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Which of them had 'been able to please <br>Allah more than the rest?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"This is known only to Him Who knows <br>what is hidden in the bosoms and what <br>the hearts conceal.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem- <br>peraments.\" <br>\"I am now going to kill you.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The time and mode of my death have <br>already been decreed.\" <br>~ a j j a j  <br>\"Allah has preferred me to you.\" <br>f <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Nobody can be proud of his relation with <br>Allfh, unless he knows his position; and <br>Allah is the only knower of the unseen.\" <br>\"Why should I not be proud of my relation <br>Hajjaj: <br>with Allah, when I am with the Amir-ul- <br>Mominin and you are with the rebels.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am with the other Muslims. I myself <br>shun mischief, but nobody can change the <br>decree of Allah.\" <br>\"What do y0.u say about what we collect <br>Hajjaj: <br>for Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do-not know what you collect for him.\" <br>Hajjaj sent for gold, silver and dresses fiom the trea- <br>sury and showed these to Saeed. <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>131 sc <br>%2 <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"These are useful, provided you are able to <br>obtain with them the things that may pro- <br>-84 <br>$,<br>vide you peace on the Day of Consterna- <br>tion (i.e Day of Judgement), when every <br>nursing mother will forget her nursing, <br>and every pregnant one will be delivered <br>of her burden, and when nothing but good <br>will be of any avail.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Are our collections not good?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"You have collected them, and you are the <br>best judge.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Do you like any of these things for your- <br>self?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I only like the things which Allah likes.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Woe to you!\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Woe is for the person who is deprived of <br>Paradise and is made to enter Hell.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>(Annoyed): \"Say how should I kill you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"As you would like to be killed.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Should I forgive you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah's forgiveness is real. Your aforgive- <br>ness is of no value.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>(To the executioner): \"Kill this man.\" <br>Hadhrat, Saeed laughed while he was being taken for <br>execution. Hajjaj was informed of this. He called him back. <br>\"What made you laugh?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Your boldness with Allah, and His,clem- <br>ency to you. \" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I am killing a person who has caused dis- <br>sent among the Muslims. (To the ex-<br>ecutioner) Kill him in front of me.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Let me say my Salaat of two rakaats.\" <br>After finishing Salaat, he faced Qiblah and recited: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts. <br>\"Make him lie on his face. We are only re- <br>Hajjaj: <br>sponsible for appearance.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was made to lie on his <br>face. <br>Saeed: <br>\"Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return <br>you, and thqnce We bring you forth a second time.\" <br>(XX:55). <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Kill him\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: I call you to witness what I recite: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, who <br>is all alone and Who has no partner and I bear witness <br>that Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is His <br>slave and His Prophet.\" <br><br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path. <br><br>CHAPTER-VIII <br>ZEAL FOR KNOWLEDGE <br>The Kalimah is the essence of Islam and the basis for <br>all achievements. No good action is acceptable with out <br>belief in Kalimah. The Sahabah, therefore, devoted most of <br>their energy, specially in the early days of Islam, to the <br>propagation of the Kalimah and to fighting with the forces <br>that resisted it. Although their engagements left them very <br>little time to drink deep from the ocean of learning with the <br>single-mindedness demanded thereof, yet their zeal even in <br>this direction has left us a legacy in the form of knowledge <br>about the Qur'an and Hadith, which is quite highly credita- <br>ble and a glaring example. When Sahabah go) a little lei- <br>sure from the work that kept them engtiged in the <br>beginning of Islam, and also when the number of people in <br>Islam grew considerably. Allah revealed the following <br>verse in the Qur'an: <br>\"And the believers should not all go out (in the path of <br>Allah). Of every group of them, a party only should go <br>forth that they (who are left behind) may gain sound <br>knowledge in feligion and that they may warn their <br>folk when they come to them, so that they may <br>beware.\" <br>(IX: 122). <br>Hadhrat ~bdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The verses of the Qur'an which were revealed in the <br>beginning of Islam, demanding every Muslim to move <br>out in the path of Allah; for example: <br>\"If you go not forth, He will afflict you with a painful <br>doom; <br>(IX:39)\" <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>'Go forth, light and heavily armed, and strive with f 3  <br>your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah; <br>s m  <br>m<br>(IX:41).' <br>These verses were later on superceded by the foregoing <br>verse, which advised only a party from each group to leave <br>their places. <br>The Sahabah, very few in number as they were, had to <br>assume the responsibilities of Islam in all fields. Allah <br>therefore endowed them with the versatility that was <br>theirs. After the Sahabah, the Islam spread far and wide <br>and the Mu~lims swelled in number. Again, the later <br>people lacked the versatility of the Sahabah. Allah then <br>caused different people to specialize in different branches <br>of Islamic learning. Mohaddit.hin were to devote them- <br>selves to the collection and propagation of Hadith. Simi- <br>larly the Fuqaha (jurists) Soofia (Experts in Zikr), Qurraa <br>(Experts in recitation of Qur'an), Mujahidin (Fighters in the <br>path of Allah), etc, each own group had its own field to <br>take up as a whole-time task. This was very necessary at <br>that time, for otherwise different branches of Islamic learn- <br>ing would not have developed so nicely, as it is difficult for <br>one man to specialize in all the branches. The Prophets <br>(alaihimus salaam), and specially Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) the chief among them, were specially en- <br>dowed with such a capacity. This will explain why the <br>stories of other eminent personalities, besides the Sahabah <br>have also been narrated in this chapter. <br>1. Sahabah's Panel for Fatwa. <br>Although all the Sahabah, along with their engagement <br>in Jihad and propagation of faith, were devoted to acquir- <br>ing and further spreading of knowledge, yet there was a <br>panel of Sahabah who were exclusively entrusted with <br>Fatwa, even during the life tirne of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The panel comprised the following Saha- <br>bah:-<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr, Hadhrat 'Umar, Hadhrat Usman, <br>Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf. Hadhrat</p></div>"

One night I <br>noticed that he was very restless. He was tossing about <br>in the bed and could not sleep. I got worried over this <br>and inquired, 'Are you suffering from any trouble or <br>worried about anything.' But he did not speak and re- <br>mained restless throughout the night. Next morning he <br>called me and said, 'Bring the collection of Hadith that <br>I gave you to keep.' I brought the book and he set fire <br>to it, till it was burnt. He said, 'The collection con- <br>tained many Hadiths that I had heard from other <br>people. I thought if I died and left behind a Hadith ac- <br>cepted as authentic by me, but really not so, then I <br>should have to answer for that.\" <br>It was Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (Radhiyallaho anho) zeal for <br>knowledge, that cau2ed him to compile a book of five hun- <br>dred Hadiths. But it was due to his extreme cautiousness <br>that he burnt the collection. <br>The Sahabah were very careful and cautious about <br>Hadith. That is why you find very few Hadiths narrated by <br>eminent Sahabah; those people who do riot hesitate to <br>quote Hadith (without authority) in their sermons from the <br>pulpit should take a lesson from this story. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the Prophet's com- <br>pany for most of his time; many Sahabah say: <br>L <br>Hadhrat \"Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was the most <br>learned amongst us;\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p></div>"

VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>137 4,<br>~r * <br>0 s  <br>\"After the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>.K8 54 <br>Q*<br>sallam), when the Khalifah's selection was under con- <br>sideration, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) * <br>addressed the people quoting all those verses of the <br>Qur'an and all such Hadiths of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) which dealt with the virtues and <br>privileges of the Ansar.\" <br>This shows how much knowledge of the Qu'ran he had, <br>and how many Hadiths he remembered. In spite of all this, <br>there are very few Ahadith that have been narrated by <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). For similar <br>reasons, Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) too was <br>not so liberal in reporting Hadith. <br>3. \t Hadhrat Mu'sab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) Car- <br>ries out Tabligh. <br>A story about Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has already been given in Chapter VII. When the <br>first group of people from Madinah embraced Islam in <br>Mina, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) to go with <br>them to teach Islam and preach to others. He remained <br>busy all the time in teaching the Qur'an and other Islamic <br>practices to the people. He stayed with Hadhrat As'ad bin <br>Zararah (Radhiyallaho anho) and was known as 'Muqree' <br>(the teacher). <br>Sa'd bin Ma'az and Usaid bin Hudhairiyah, who were <br>among the chiefs of Madinah, did not like Mus'ab's activi- <br>ties. Sa'd said to Usaid: <br>You go to As'ad and tell that we do not like his having <br>brought a stranger with him to Madinah, who misleads <br>the poor and simple folk of the town.\" <br>Usaid went to Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho anho) and <br>talked to him very harshly. Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to him: <br>\"You first listen to him; if you like his teachings, you <br>may accept them; if not, you have every right to de- <br>nounce and stop him.\" <br>Usaid agreed to it. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) ex- <br>plained the virtues of Islam and recited a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before him. Usaid said:</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>138 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"These teachings are very fine and these verses are <br>simply beautiful. How do you admit a person to your <br>faith?\" <br>He said: \t \"You take a bath, put on clean clothes and recite <br>the Kalimah.\" <br>Usaid immediately complied with all these formalities and <br>embraced Islam. He then went to Sa'd and brought him to <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) to listen to his Tabligh. Sa'd <br>also embraced Islam. No sooner had Sa'd accepted Islam <br>than he went to people of his clan (Banu Ash-hal) and said <br>to them: <br>\"What type of person do you think I am?\" <br>They replied: \"You are the best and the noblest of <br>clan.\" <br>the <br>He then said: \"I have vowed not to talk to your men and <br>women until you all embrace Islam and be- <br>lieve in Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe was- <br>sallam).\" <br>All the men and women of Banu Ash-ha1 embraced Islam <br>then and there. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>to teach them and train them in Islam. <br>No sooner did anybody embrace Islam than he began <br>to preach it. Everyone of them considered it incumbent <br>upon him to preach and teach to others what he know <br>about Islam. His trade, farm or occupation was no barrier to <br>Tabligh. <br>4. \t Hadhrat 'Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is one <br>of the most eminent Sahabah and was an expert in the reci- <br>tation of the Qur'an. Very few Arabs were literate before <br>Islam, and he was one of these. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) used to dictate the revealed Qur'an to <br>him. He memorised the Qur'an during the life time of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and had thorough <br>. <br>understanding of it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is the <br>greatest Qari of my Ummat.\" <br><br>He used \t to finish the Qur'an once in Tahajjud in eight <br>nights. Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassalam) said <br>to him: <br>\"Allah has commanded me to recite the Qur'an to <br>you.\" <br>He said: \t \"0, Prophet of Allah! Did Allah mention me by <br>my name?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Yes, He mentioned you by your name.\" <br>Tears began to roll down his cheeks with excessive joy. <br>Hadhrat Jundub bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When I went to Madinah to acquire knowledge, I <br>found that people were sitting in groups, and each <br>group wag entrusted to a teacher. In one of the groups I <br>saw a person teaching Hadith, clad in two sheets of <br>cloth and looking like a traveller. I asked the people, <br>'Who is this person?' They said, 'He is our esteemed <br>Imam, Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho).' <br>When he finished teaching, I followed him to his <br>house. He was staying in a very old and dilapidated <br>building, with little or no furniture. I noticed Hadhrat <br>Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) living in a very simple and <br>ascetic life.' <br>Hadhrat Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Once the Prohet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) tested <br>me in my knowledge of the Qur'an. He asked me, <br>'Ubayy, which is the most august verse of the Qur'an?' <br>I said, 'Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) know best.' He again asked my the same question <br>and I gave the same modest and respectful reply. When <br>he put the same question once again, I replied, 'The <br>most august verse in the Qur'an is Ayatul Kursi (11: <br>255).' My reply made him very happy. He said, 'May <br>-<br>Allah bless you through your knowledge.' <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was leading <br>Salaat when he missed one verse. Ubayy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) pointed out the correction from behind. On finishing <br>Salaat, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired <br>'Who corrected me?' He was told that it was Hadhrat Ubayy</p></div>"

He remarked, 'I also thought that it <br>was he.\" <br>In spite of his devotion to knowledge and his special <br>job of writing the Qur'an, he took part in all the battles by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He did <br>not miss a single campaign or expedition led by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Huzaifah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Anxiety Re- <br>garding Tribulations. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the <br>well-known Sahabah. He is known as 'Keeper of Secrets.' <br>The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) had confided to <br>him the names of Munafiqin, and had informed him in <br>chronological order all the tribulations which the Muslims <br>were to face till the last day. He gave him full details (viz. <br>the name of the mischief maker, his parents' names, his <br>community, etc.) about the incidents that were going to <br>affect three hundred or more people. Hadhrat Huzaifah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Other people used to -ask the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about good things, while I always <br>asked him about the adverse events, so that I might <br>guard against them.\" <br>He then narrated the following conversation with the <br>Prophet: <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Shall we revert to <br>evil, after the good that you have brought <br>us?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes. The evil is coming.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"Shall we have good again after that evil?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"Huzaiiah! Go and read the Qur'an, medi- <br>tate on its meaning and follow its com-<br>mandments.\" <br>But Huzaifah anxiety grew more and more, and he con- <br>tinued his queries about evils that were to befall the ,Mus- <br>lims. <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Tell me if good will <br>come after that evil?\" <br><br>TheProphet: \t \"Yes, good will come again, but the hearts <br>of the people will not be so clear as before.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"And will there by any evil coming after <br>this good?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes, There will be such persons who will <br>misguide the people and take them to Hell.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"What should I do if I witness that time?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"If there be a group of Muslims united <br>under one Amir, then join them, otherwise <br>dissociate yourself from all such factions <br>and be secluded in a corner, or take refuge <br>under a tree (i.e., in the forest) and be there <br>till you die.\" <br>As the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had dis- <br>closed to him the identities of the Munafiqin of that time, <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to ask him: <br>\"Is there any Munafiq among my deputies?\" <br>Heonce replied: \t \"Yes. There is one, but I shall not dis- <br>close his name.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) dismissed the man, <br>probably by his own discernment. <br>Whenever somebody died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) would inquire if Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was participating in the funeral prayer. If <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) did not do so, then Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) would also absent himself from <br>that funeral: <br>'when Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he wept in anxiety and uneasiness. People <br>said to him:- <br>\"Are you weeping over your departure <br>from this world?\" <br>He said: <br>\"No. I am not weeping over that. I love to <br>die. I weep because 1 do not know <br>whether, at this time of my departure <br>from this world. Allah is pleased with <br>me or not .\" <br>He then prayed: \"0,Allah, these are the last moments of</p></div>"

Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me. I <br>would be with the Prop-het (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) at times when no one else was there. I once com- <br>plained to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>about my poor memory. He said, 'Spread your shawl!' I <br>did so. He made some signs on the shawl with his own <br>hands and said, 'Now wrap this shawl around you.' I <br>wrapped it around my breast. Since then, i never have <br>forgotten anything that I have wished to remember.\" <br>The people of Suftah were residents in the Prophet's <br>mosque. They had no regular source of income. They were <br>the guests of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who <br>transferred to them the Sadaqah and shared with them the <br>gifts that he received. Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was one of them. He would, sometimes, go without food for <br>days together and sometimes would behave like a lunatic, <br>due to 5p-.cessive hunger, as we have already seen in Chap- <br>ter I1I:Iri spite of such difficulties, he was all the time occu- <br>pied in memorising the sayings of the Prophet. <br>This enabled him to narrate such a large number of <br>Ahadith Imaam Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullahi alaih) has attribu- <br>ted as many as 5 374 Ahadith to him. Once he narrated the <br>following Hadith:-</p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br><br>0,<br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br><br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br><br>17 / <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br><br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br><br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse: <br>\"Lo! I, indeed I am Alfah. There is none worthy of <br>worship savz Me. So serve me and establish Salaat for <br>My remembrance.\" <br>He said: \"Alright, take me to Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came out from insidwand said: <br>\"0,'Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday (on Thurs- <br>day night) the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>prayed to Allah, '0,Allah strengthen Islam with either <br>'Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest'. It seems <br>that his prayer has been answered in your favour.\" <br>'Umar then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and embraced Islam on Friday morning. 'Umar's Islam <br>was a terrible blow to the morale of the unbelievers, but <br>still the Muslims were few in number and the whole coun- <br>try was against them. The disbelievers intensified ,their <br>efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims and the <br>extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on <br>their side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in <br><br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new, <br>and returned to their country. On approaching Mecca, they <br>learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions wen: <br>going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to <br>Abyssinia and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protec- <br>tion of a few inflyential people. This is known as the first <br>migration to Abyssinia. Later on, a bigger group of eighty- <br>three men and eighteen women emigrated to Abyssinia <br>(separately). This is called the second emigration to that <br>country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. <br>The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought <br>of peace enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They <br>sent a delegation to Abyssinia with handsome presents for <br>the king, his courtiers and the clergy. The delegation first <br>met the chiefs and the priests and, by offering them pres- <br>ents, succeeded in winning the court officials to their side. <br>Having thus made their way to the royal court, they pros- <br>trated themselves before the king and then presenting the <br>gifts put their case before him. They &id: <br>\"0,king! A few foolish lads of our community have re- <br>nounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an <br>absolutely new religion, which is opposed to'our as <br>well as your religions. They have come and-settled in <br>your country. The nobility of Mecca, their own parents <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they <br>could make to the charges brought against them. Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) rose and addressed the king thus: <br>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither <br>knew Allah nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped <br>stones. We used to eat carrion and commit all sorts of <br>undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did not make <br>good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among <br>us would thrive,at the expense of the weak. Till at last, <br>Allah raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>our reformation. His noble descent, up-right conduct, <br>integrity of purpose, and pure life are only too well <br>known amongst us. He called upon us to worship Al- <br>lah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone- <br>worship. He enjoined upon us right conduct, and for- <br>bade us from indecency. He taught us to tell the truth, <br>to make good our trust, to have regard for our kith and <br>kin, and to do good to our neighbours. From him we <br>learnt to observe Salaat. Fasting, Zakaat and good con- <br>duct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid blood- <br>shed. He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, <br>misappropriating the orphan's heritage, bringing false <br>accusations against others, and all other indecent <br>things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, the won- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\" <br>and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no <br>means hand over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed <br>and disgraced, they held a counsel. One of them said: <br>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's <br>wrath upon their heads.\" <br>Although the others did not agree to sukh a drastic step (for <br>after all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would <br>not listen. The next day, they excited the king by telling <br>him that those heretics denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) <br>and did not believe in his Divinity. The Muslims were <br>again summoned to the court. They were much more dis- <br>tressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief <br>in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam). they said: <br>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him to <br>our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a <br>servant and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which <br>He conveyed to the virgin and pure Maryam.\" <br>Negus said: \"'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does :not say <br>anything beyond that.\" <br>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king <br>would not listen to them. He returned to the de1t:gatioil the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness. <br>This is to meditate over the greatness of Allah. If this is <br>done, it becomes very easy- to perform all other acts of <br>righteousness with full sincerity. Is it so very difficult to <br>devote a few minutes, out of the twenty four hours of a day <br>at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation? <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passing <br>near the ruins of Thamud during Tabuk expedition: <br>The Tabuk expedition is one of the major campaigns of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and the last one <br>in which he personally took part. When he received the <br>news that the Caesar (of Rome) had mustered a large force <br>to crush the power of Islam and was on his way (through <br>Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah <br>to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 <br>A.H., the devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the <br>weather was hot and the fighting was expected to be very <br>tough. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made an <br>open declaration that the Muslims should gather in <br>strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman <br>Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the <br>equipment of the expedition. It was on this occasion that <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not even <br>dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on ac- <br>count of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. <br>Except the women, children (who were excusable), those <br>who were ordered to stay behind by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, nearly every- <br>body joined the expedition. Also among those left behind <br>were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for <br>themselves, nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) able to provide them with any. It is about such people <br>that Allah says in his Book: <br>\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in <br>sorrow that they could not find means to spend.\" <br>(IX:92) <br>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any <br>excuse whatsoever were three in number. Their story <br>would be presently related. On their way to Syria when the <br>expedition reached the habitat ion of Tharnud, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his face with his shirt <br>and quickened the pace of his camel. He also instructed the <br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying: <br>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" <br>Allah's reply to thie was: <br>(*\\ $9)I> bi *ju ji <br>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\" <br>From amongst the .f&thful, there were only three persons <br>who failed to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura- <br>rah bin Rabi, Hilal MR Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Rad- <br>hipallaho anhum). Murarah had orchards of dates, laden <br>with fruit. He pershaded himself to lag behind with the <br>piea: <br>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What <br>possible harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this <br>one?\" <br>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this <br>prevented him from going out. But when he realised his <br>folly, he gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, <br>too, that had caused him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's case was different. Some <br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>4 7<br>of his kinsfolk who had been away for a long time had just <br>returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their company <br>that he did not join the expedition. He also had partici- <br>pated in all the campaigns previously and thought (like <br>Murarah) that it would not matter much if he missed just <br>that one campaign. When he came to know of the serious- <br>ness of his default, he made up his mind to sever all his <br>connections with those relatives who had been the cause of <br>that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, <br>which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says: <br>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at the <br>time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had <br>never possessed this number before. It was a habit with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never <br>disclosed the destination of his expeditions, but he <br>would k e e ~  <br>enquiring about the conditions prevailing <br>elsewhere. But this time in view of the distance, the <br>hot season, and the strength of the enemy, he had de- <br>clared his destination, so that preparations could be <br>made thorough and complete. The number of the par- <br>ticipants was so large that it was difficult to note down <br>their names even, so much so, that absentees could <br>hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of <br>Madinah were full of fruit. I intended every morning to <br>make preparation for the journey but, somehow or <br>other, the days passed by and I made no progress. I <br>was satisfied that I had all the necessary means at my <br>disposal and that I would be ready in no time if I once <br>did decide to do so. I was still in this state of indeci- <br>sion when I learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho daihe <br>wasallam) had left with his companions. The idea still <br>lingered in my mind that I would take a day or two to <br>get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination <br>continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in <br>Tabuk drew very near. I then tried to get ready but <br>again, somehow or other, I did not do so. Now, when I <br>came to look at the people left behind, I realised that <br>there was none in Madinah except those who had been <br>condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially <br>exempted from going for certain reasons. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk in-<br>quired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' <br>Somebody said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in <br>wealth and ease has caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az <br>Stories of the ~ a h a a b a h  <br>interrupted and said, No, this is wrong. As far as our <br>knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's <br>return. I was struck with grief and remorse. Good ex- <br>cuses one after the other entered my mind, and I was <br>sure that I could escape the Prophet's wrath with one <br>of them for the time being, and later on I could pray for <br>forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice of the wise <br>men of my family in the matter. But when I knew that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had actually <br>arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth <br>would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain <br>truth. It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that whenever he returned from a journey <br>he would repair to the musjid, first of all, say two <br>rakaat 'Tahiyyatul musjid' and then stay there for a <br>while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in the <br>musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on <br>solemn oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany <br>him on the campaign. He took them at their words, <br>leaving the rest to Allah. Just then I came and greeted <br>him with 'salaam'. He turned his face with a sardonic <br>smile. I besought him with the words: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! You turn your face from me. By Allah! I am <br>neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my <br>faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. He then <br>said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had <br>you not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly <br>man, I am sure I would escape his displeasure through <br>(seemingly) reasonable excuses, for Allah has endowed <br>me with the gift of the gab. But in your case I am sure <br>that if 1 appease you with a false statement, Allah <br>would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, <br>I am sure that if I displease you by confessing the <br>simple truth, then Allah would very soon blow away <br>your displeasure. I, therefore, make bold to speak the <br>very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all. I had never <br>been so we11 to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking <br>the truth.' He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will <br>decide about you. When I left the musjid, many a man <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>of my clan blamed me and admonished me thus; <br>'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after <br>making some good excuse for once, you had requested <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pray for <br>your goodness, surely his prayer would have sufficed <br>you.' I inquired of them if there were any more people <br>like me. They informed me that there were two other <br>persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, <br>who also had admitted their faults like me and re-<br>ceived the same reply from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I knew that both of them were very <br>good Muslims and had participated in the campaign of <br>Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) issued <br>instructions that none was to speak with the three of <br>us.' <br>It is a cqmmon principle that displeasure is shbwn <br>where some attachment exists, and a reprimand is given <br>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incor- <br>rigible person would be a futile effort. <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho<br>alaihe wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted <br>us. Nobody was prepared to mix with or even speak to <br>us. It seemed as if I was living in a strange land alto- <br>gether. My own birth-place looked like a foreign local- <br>ity and my bosom friends behaved like strangers. 'The <br>earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur'an IX: <br>113)for me. The thing that worried me most was that, <br>if I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not lead my funeral prayer, <br>and if the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) died in <br>the meantime, I would be doomed for ever, with none <br>to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. The <br>other two companions of mine confined themselves to <br>their houses. I was the most daring of the three: I <br>would go to the market, and join the Jamaat for Salaat, <br>but nobody would talk to me. I would approach the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say 'Assa- <br>lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his <br>lips moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete <br>the Salaat by standing close to him, and I would look <br>at him from the corner of my eye to learn if he ever <br>cast a single glance at me. I noticed that when I was <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>made over a letter to me from the Christian King of <br>Ghassan. Thus it read: 'We have come to know that <br>your master has ill-treated you. Allah may not-keep <br>you in abasement and in disgrace. You had better come <br>to us. We shall extend all help to you.' When I read <br>this letter, I uttered \"Inna-lillahi-wa-Inna-ilaihi-raaji-<br>oon\" To Allah we belong and to Him is our return; and <br>said; 'So my state of affairs (had) reached such an ebb <br>that even the Kafirs were aspiring to draw me away <br>from Islam.' I codld not imagine a calamity worse than <br>that. I went and threw the letter into an oven. There- <br>after I presented myself to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and exclaimed: '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Your indifference towards me has lowered me to such <br>an extent that even the Kafirs are building up their <br>hopes over me.\" <br>When forty days had passed in this condition, a mess- <br>enger of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>brought me this mandate: 'Be separated from your <br>wife' I inquired, 'Am I to divorce her?' He replied: 'No, <br>only be separated.' A similar message was delivered to <br>my other two companions as well. I consequently said <br>to my wife: 'Go to your parents and wait till Allah de- <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>sitting on the roof of my house stricken with grief, and <br>the earth had 'straightened' for me and the life had <br>become dismal for me, I heard a crier's cry from over <br>the top of the mount Sula; 'Happy tidings to you, 0, <br>Kaab.' The moment I heard this, I fell prostrate on the <br>ground and tears of joy rolled down my cheeks, as I <br>understood that the ordeal was now over. In fact, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had announced <br>the Divine forgiveness for all three of us after the <br>Salaat that morning. At this, a person ran up the top of <br>the mountain and yelled out the cry that had reached <br>me. Thereafter, a rider came galloping to deliver the <br>same happy news to me. 1 gave away as a gift the <br>clothes, I was wearing, to the messenger of glad tid- <br>ings. I swear by Allah I had no other clothes in my pos- <br>session at that time. I dressed up by borrowing clothes <br>from some friend and went to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). As I entered the musjid, the people <br>in the audience of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ran to congratulate me. Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was the first to approach me. He shook my hand <br>with a warmth that I shall never forget. Thereafter I of-<br>fered my salutation to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I found his face beaming and radiant like <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives. <br>(2) \t Their devotion and obedience to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallabo alaihe wasallam). For full fifty days the <br>whole Muslim community, even their nearest and <br>dearest, would not speak to the three persons, in <br>obedience to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) orders. The three persons themselves went <br>most steadfastly through the ordeal imposed on <br>them. <br>I <br>(3) \t Their strong faith. Kaab was so much perturbed <br>when he received the letter from the Christian <br>King, exciting him against the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). His words and his action at that <br>time are a testimony to the strong faith in his <br>heart. <br>Let us search our hearts and see how much devotion <br>we have in them for the observance of the duties we owe to <br>Islam. Leaving aside Zakaat and Hajj, which involve the <br>sacrifice of money, take the case of Salaat alone, which is <br>the most important pillar of Islam after Imaan. How many <br>of us are particular about it? <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me, you will see how I <br>treat you!' It then closes upon him so much that his <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other. As <br>many as seventy serpents are then set upon him, to <br>keep biting him till the Day of Resurrection. These ser- <br>pents are so venomous that if one of them happened to <br>spurt its venom upon the earth, not a single blade of <br>grass would ever grow.\" <br>After this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The grave is either a garden of Paradise or a pit of <br>Hell.\" <br>Fear of Allah is the basic and essential qualification of <br>a Muslim. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ad- <br>vised the believers to remember death, off and on, and to <br>keep the fear of Allah ever present in their hearts. <br>11. \tHadhrat Hanzlah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Pear of Nifaq: <br>Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) when he delivered a sermon. Our hearts <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I <br>have turned Munafiq, 0 Prophet of Allah!' He inquired <br>about the matter, and I repeated what I had said to Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Thereupon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'By Him Who con- <br>trols my life, if you could keep up for all times the <br>fervour aroused in you when you are with me, angels <br>would greet you in your walks and in your beds. But, <br>0,Hanzlah! This is rare! This is rare!\" <br>We have to attend to our personal and impersonal <br>worldly affairs, and therefore we cannot be contemplating <br>the Hereafter for all the twenty-four hours of the day. <br>According to what has been said by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), complete absorption in the Hereafter is <br>rare, and it should not be expected by all. It is only for the <br>angels to remain in the same state for ever. In case of men, <br>the state of their mind changes with circumstances and en- <br>vironments. But we can see from this story how anxious <br>the Sahabah were about the condition of their Imaan. Hanz- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) suspects Nifaq in himself wher, he <br>feels that the condition of his mind at home is not the same <br>as it is when he is with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse: <br>\"And when the heaven splitteth asunder and beco- <br>meth rosy like red hide\", <br>(LV: 37) <br>the hair of his body stood on end, and he was nearly <br>choked, with excessive weeping. He would cry and say: <br>\"Alas; what will happen to me on the day when even <br>the Heaven splitteth asunder. Woe is me!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alai-he-wasallam) said to him: <br>\"Your crying has made even the angels weep\". <br>Once an Ansari sat and wept after Tahajjud, saying: <br>\"I cry to Allah for protection from the fire of Hell\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have made the angels weep today\". <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>once weeping. His wife also began to weep on seeing him <br>in this condition. He enquired of her: <br>\"Why are you weeping?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse: <br>\"Every soul will taste of death\" <br>(111:185) <br>he began to repeat it again and again. He heard a voice from <br>a corner of the room saying: <br>\"How often are you going to repeat this verse? Your <br>recitation has already caused the death of four Jinns\". <br>It is reported about another Sheikh that (while reciting <br>the Qur'an) when he reached the verse: <br>\"Then are they returned unto Allah, their Lord, the <br>Just, is not His the Command?\" <br>(VI:62) <br>he gave out a cry, shivered and breathed his last. <br>There are many stories of this type. Fudhail, a famous <br>Sheikh, says: <br>\"Fear of Allah leads to everything that is good\". <br>Shibli, another Sheikh of high position, says: <br>\"Whenever I have felt Allah's fear in me, I have found <br>a fresh door of knowledge and wisdom opened for <br>me\". <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear <br>from the fear of Allah is safe from entrance into the fire <br>of Hell.\" <br>He also said: <br>\"When a Muslim shivers with the fear of Allah, his <br>sins fall away from him like the falling leaves of a <br>tree.\" <br>The dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"A person weeping with fear of Allah cannot go to Hell <br>until milk goes back into the teats (which is an im-<br>possibility)\". <br>Hadhrat Uqbah bin Amir (Radhiyallaho anho) once in- <br>quired of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"What is the way to salvation?\" <br>He replied: \"Hold your tongue, stay indoors and cry over <br>your sins.\" <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once inquired of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Is there anybody among your followers who will go to <br>Paradise without reckoning?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that, when he wept, he smeared his tears over <br>his face and beard saying: <br>\"I have heard that the fire of Hell does not touch the <br>place touched by these tears.\" <br>Thabit Banani was suffering from a disease of the eyes. <br>His doctor said to him: <br>\"Your eyes would be all right, provided you do not <br>weep in future.\" <br>He replied: \"What is the good of an eye if it cannot shed <br>tears.\" <br>Yazid bin Maisarah (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>'There can be seven reasons for weeping viz., extreme <br>joy, insanity, extreme pain, horror, artifice, intoxica- <br>tion and fear of Allah. A single tear shed in the fear of <br>Allah is sufficient to quench oceans of fire (of Hell).\" <br>Hadhrat Ka'ab Ahbar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I <br>\"By Him who holds my life in His (hands), I love to <br>weep for fear of Allah, with tears flowing down my <br>cheeks, rather than spend a mountain of gold in <br>charity\" <br><br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>59 3= <br>Cl a <br>There are numerous other sayings of the Saints and <br>'E;i<br>other pious people, indicating that weeping because of the <br>3,<br>rm<br>fear of Allah, and over one's sins, is very effective and ben- <br>eficial in attaining spiritual elevation. We should not, how- <br>ever, lose hope in Allah. His Mercy is all-embracing. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal!aho anho) says: <br>\"If it be announced on the Day of Judgement that all <br>except one individual shall go to Hell, my expectation <br>of the Mercy of Allah would make me hope that I may <br>be that chosen one. Again, if it be announced on that <br>day that all except one individual shall go to Paradise, <br>then my sins would make me fear that I may be that <br>condemned one.\" <br>It is therefore necessary that we should combine fear and <br>hope together in our hearts. Especially when the time of <br>death is apprdaching, we should have more hope than fear. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"None of you should die, except with a strong hope in <br>the Mercy of Allah.\" <br>When Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Radhiyallaho anho) ap- <br>proached his end, he sent for his son and asked him to read <br>to him the Ahaadith that induce hope in Allah and His <br>Mercy. <br><br>CHAPTER I11 <br>ABSTINENCE AND SELF-DENIAL OF THE SAHABAH <br>There is such a wealth of Ahadith about this aspect of <br>the Prophet's life that it is really difficult to chose a few ex- <br>amples. He said: <br>\"Abstinence is an asset of a Mo'min.\" <br>1. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Dislike <br>for gold: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"My Lord offered to turn the mounts of Mecca into <br>gold for me. But my supplication to Him was; '0, <br>Allah! I like to eat one day and feel hungry the next, so <br>that I may cry before Thee and remember Thee when I <br>am hungry; and be grateful to Thee and glorify Thee <br>when my hunger is gone!\" <br>Thus said our Prophet '(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>We profess to follow him and are proud of being in the fold <br>of his Ummat. Isn't. it incumbent upon us to follow him in <br>practice also? <br>2. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Life of <br>Abstinence: <br>Once, the prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided to stay away from his wives for one month, as he was <br>displeased with them on some account. He lived for that <br>one month in a separate room in the upper storey. A <br>rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>divorced his wives got afloat among the Sahabah. When 'U <br>mar heard of this, he came running to the musjid and <br>found the Sahabah sitting in groups, struck with grief over <br>the Prophet's suffering. He went to his daughter Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), who was a wife of the Prophet, and <br>found her weeping in her room. He said to her: <br>\"Why are you weeping now? Have I not been warning <br>you all these .times to refrain from any act likely to <br>cause the Prophet's displeasure'?\" <br><br>Ch. 111:Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 61 <br>He returned to the musjid and found some of the Sahabah <br>sitting near the pulpit and weeping. He sat there for some <br>time, but could not sit for long due to his excessive grief. <br>He went towards the room where the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was staying. He found Rabah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave, sitting on the steps. He asked him to go <br>and inquire of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>he could allow 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to see him. <br>Rabah went inside and came back to inform him that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held his peace and <br>said nothing. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>musjid and sat near the pulpit. Again the anguish eating <br>his heart would not allow him any rest, and he requested <br>Rabah to convey his request to the Prophet a second time. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did not make any <br>answer this time too. After tarrying near the pulpit for <br>some time more, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) craved per- <br>mission to see the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the third time. This time, his request was acceded to. When <br>he was ushered in, he saw the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) lying on a date leaf matting. The crossed pattern <br>of the matting could easily be seen imprinted on his hand- <br>some body. He had a leather bag filled with the bark of the <br>datepalm as his pillow. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I greeted him with Assalamo alaikum and inquired: <br>'Have you divorced your wives, 0,Prophet of Allah?\" <br>He answered in the negative. Much relieved, then I <br>made bold to remark, a bit amusingly; '0, Prophet of <br>Allah! we the Qureysh have always been having the <br>upper hand over our women, but in case of the Ansar <br>of Madinah, it is the women who have the upper hand. <br>Our women have also got influenced by the women <br>over here'. I said a few more similar things which <br>made him smile. I noticed that the contents of his <br>room consisted of only three pieces of tanned skin and <br>a handful of barley lying in a corner. I looked about, <br>but I failed to find anything else. I began to weep. He <br>said; 'Why are you weeping?' I replied: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! why should I not weep? I can see the mat's pat- <br>tern imprinted on your body, and I am also beholding <br>all that you have got in this room. 0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Pray that Allah may grant ample provisions for us. The <br>Persians and the Romans who have no true faith and <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter? Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next. I implored him: '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! Ask forgiveness for me. I was really <br>in the wrong\" <br>Look at the household effects of the sovereign in this <br>world and in the hereafter, and the beloved Prophet of <br>Allah. See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>\"It consisted of a skin filled with the bark of date- <br>palm.\" <br>The same question was put to Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha); <br>she said: <br>\"It consisted of a piece of canvas, which I spread <br>doublefolded under him. Once I laid it fourfold in an <br>effort to make it more comfortable. The next morning <br>he asked me: 'What did you spread under me last <br>night?' I replied! 'The same canvas, but I had four- <br>folded it instead of the customary double fold.' He <br>said: 'Keep it as it was before. The additional softness <br>stands in the way of getting up for Tahajjud.\"' <br>Now let us look around and survey the furniture of our <br>bedrooms. We, who live in so much comfort, never hesitate <br>to complain of hard times, instead of being grateful and <br>more obedient to Allah for his bounties. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) in a State <br>of Hunger <br>. <br>Once, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) after <br>wiping his nose with piece of fine linen remarked to him- <br>self: <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>during the night; his wife and his servant taking turns with <br>him in the prayers. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (~adhiyallaho anho) Daily Al- <br>lowance from the Bait-ul Ma1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was a cloth <br>merchant and lived by that trade. On the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), people selected him <br>as the Khalifah. Next day with some cloth slung on his <br>arms, he was proceeding to the market as usual when <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) met him in the way. <br>'Urnar: <br>\"Where are you going to, Abu Bakr?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"To the market\". <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"If you get busy with your trade, who will <br>carry out the duties of the caliphate?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t \"How am I to feed my family then?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Let's go to Abu 'Ubaidah (In charge of\"Bait-ul- <br>Mal), who will fix some daily allowance for <br>you from the 13ait-ul-Mal.\" <br>They both went to Abu 'Ubaidah (Kadhiyallaho anho). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"When Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was selected as <br>Khalifah. he said to the people: 'You well know that I <br>live bv trade, and my income therefrom is sufficient to <br>meet mv expenses. Now I have to devote my full time <br>to the affairs of the state and therefore my family al- <br>lowance shall be paid from the 'Bait-ul-Mal.'\" <br>~ a d h r a tA'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"At the time of his death, Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) directed rjle to hand over to his successor all that <br>was issued to him from the Bait-ul-Mal for his house- <br>hold needs. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>left no cash after him. Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: <br>\"Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) left a milch she-camel, <br>a bowl and a servant.\" <br>A(;c;ording to some other narrators. he left a bedding also. <br>When all these were made over to 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), his successor, he remarked: <br>\"Mav Allah be merciful to Abu Bakr! He has set a pre-<br>cedent for his successors which is very hard t o  <br>follow.\" <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali. Hadhrat <br>Usman, Hadhrat Zubair and Hadhrat Talhah (Radhivallaho <br>anhum) once proposed that Hadhrat Umar's (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) allowance might be increased, as it was hardlv suffi- <br>cient for him. but nobody dared to suggest that to Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho). People approached Ummul- <br>momineen Hadhrat Hafsah (radhivallaho anha), his daugh- <br>ter, and requested her to ascertain 'Umar's (Kadhivallaho <br>anho) reaction to the suggestion without mentioning their <br>names to him. When Hadhrat Hafsah (Kadhiyallaho anha) <br>talked about it to tladhrat IJmar (Kadhivallaho anho), he <br>became angry and said: <br>\"Who are the persons making this suggestion?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Let me first know your opinion.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If I knew them, I would smite them on their faces <br>I-jafsah! just tell me what was the Prophet's best dress <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a pair of reddish brown clothes, which the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wore on Friday or <br>while receiving some envoy.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What was the best of food that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) ever took at your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Simple barley bread was the only food we used to <br>take. One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah! Go and tell these people that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has set a standard by his <br>personal example. I must follow him. My example and <br>that of my other two companions viz., the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and Abu Bakr (Radhival- <br>laho anho) is like that of three men travelling on the <br>same road. The first man started with a provision and <br>reached the goal. The second followed the first and <br>joined him. Now the third is on his way. If he follows <br>their way, he will also join them, otherwise he can <br>never reach them;' <br>Such is the life of the person who was a dread for the <br>monarchs of the world. What a simple life he lived! Once <br>he was reciting the Khutbah when it was noticed that his <br>lower cloth had as many as twelve patches, including one <br>of leather. Once he came late for his Jumu'ah prayer and <br>told the congregation: <br>\"Excuse me, people! I got late because I was washing <br>my clothes and had no other clothes to put on.\" <br>Once he was having his meal when 'Utbah bin Abi <br>Farqad (Radhiyallaho anho) asked permission to see him. <br><br>Ch. III: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 67 <br>He allowed him in and invited him to share the food with <br>him. 'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when <br>vieing with one another in running after the luxuries of this <br>world. <br>6. <br>Bilal's (Radhiyallaho anho) story about the Prophet: <br>Someone inquired of Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) how <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) met his expenses. <br>He replied: <br>\"He never kept back anything for future use. I arranged <br>money for him. Whenever a needy person, whether <br>hungry or naked, came to him, he would make him <br>over to me and I would then arrange for his needs by <br>borrowing money from somebody. This is what usually <br>happened. Once a Mushrik came to me and said: 'Look <br>here! I have a lot of money to spare. Don't borrow <br>money from anvbody else. Whenever you need it, <br>come straight to me.' I exclaimed: 'This is indeed fine.' <br>I began to borrow money from him to meet the needs <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). One day, <br>after I had taken mv Wudhu and was about to call <br>Azaan, the same Mushrik accompanied bv some <br>people came and shouted, '0,Negro!' When I attended <br>to him. he began to abuse me, using filthv language <br>and said: 'How manv davs are left of this month? 'I <br>Stories of the Saltaabah \t<br>said: 'It is about to finish. 'He said most insolently: <br>'Look here! there are only four days left of this month. <br>If you fail to clear up your debts by the end of the <br>month. 1 shall take you as my slave for my money and <br>then you will be grazing sheep as you have been doing <br>before.' After saying this he went away. I remained <br>melancholy and full of grief throughout the day. After <br>Isha when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was alone, I went and narrated the story to him, <br>saying: '0, Prophet of Allah! you have nothing with <br>you. nor can I arrange any money from somewllere so <br>quickly. I am afraid the Mushrik will disgrace me. I <br>therefore intend to keep away for such time as you get <br>sufficient money to clear the debts.' I went home, took <br>my sword, shield, and shoes, and waited for the morn- <br>ing to make for some other place. lust before dawn, <br>somebody came to me and said. 'Hurry up. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wants you.' I hur-<br>ried to the musjid and found four loaded camels sitting <br>near the Prophet. He said: 'Good news. Bilal. Allah has <br>made arrangements for clearing your debts. Take these <br>camels with their load. The Chief of Fidak has sent <br>them as a gift to me.' I thanked Allah and took the <br>camels and cleared up all the debts. In the meantime, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept sitting in <br>the musjid. When I returned, I said: 'Alhamdulillah.' <br>All the debts are now clear, 0.Prophet of Allah' He in- <br>quired: 'Is there anvthing left from the gift?\" I said, <br>\"Yes, somethirlg is still left.\" He said. \"Go and spend <br>that as well. I shall not go home until the whole lot is <br>spent.' The Propket kept sitting in the musjid all day <br>long. After Isha he inquired again if everything had <br>been spent. I said: 'Something is still left unspent. A <br>few of the poor have not turned up so far.' He slept in <br>the nlusjid that night. Next dav after Isha'a he again <br>called me to him and said: 'Bilal! Is everything fin- <br>ished now?\" I said: 'Yes, Allah has blessed you with <br>peace. Everything is now spent and gone.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) begail to hymn the Glory <br>of Allah over this news, for he did not like death to <br>overtake him while any of the riches were in his pos- <br>session. He then went home and met his family.\" <br>It is common with pious people that they do not like to <br>keep any wealth with them. How could the Prophet (Sallal- <br>e <br><br>Ch. Ill: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 69 <br>laho alaihe wasallam), being the fountain-head of all piety, <br>like to keep anything in his possession? It is said of Mau- <br>lana Abdur Rahim (May Allah have mercy on him), a Saint <br>of our time, that all that he received as gifts from the <br>people was immediately spent by him and he did not keep <br>anything for himself. A few days before his death, he gave <br>over all his clothes to one of his attendants and said: <br>\"If I need to wear any clothes in my life. I shall borrow <br>them from you.\" <br>And I also know about my late father, who whenever had <br>any money left after Maghrib, would give it to someone of <br>his creditors (he was several thousand rupees in debt) and <br>would say 'I would not like to keep this source of trouble <br>with me for the night.' <br>7. \t<br>Another story of Hadhrat Abu Hurairah's (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) Hunger: <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I wish you had seen some of us living on a starvation <br>diet for several days, successively, so much so that we <br>could not even stand erect. On account of spasms of <br>hunger, I would lie on my belly and press my stomach <br>against the ground or keep a stone tied to mv abdomen. <br>Once, I intentionally sat in wait for some notable <br>people to pass that way. As Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) came along, I joined in conversation <br>with him, intending to continue the talk till we reach <br>his home, where I expected him to invite me to share <br>his meals, as was his wont. But his answer was brief, <br>and my plan did not work. The same thing happened <br>with Hadhrat Umar, (Radhiyallaho anho) when he <br>chanced that way. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) himself was the next to come. A smile spread <br>on his face when he saw me, for he at once divined <br>why I was sitting there. 'Come with me, Abu Hurairah', <br>lie said, and I accompanied him to his house. He took <br>me in. where a bowl of milk was brought before him. <br>He asked, 'Who brought this milk?\" and was told that <br>somebody had sent it as a present. HA bade me to go <br>and invite all the Suffah friends. The Suffah people <br>were treated as everyone's guests by all the Muslims. <br>I'hev were such persons who had neither hearth nor <br>home of their own, nor anv other means of livelihood. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Their number varied with time. But at this particular <br>juncture, they mustered seventy in all. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>and returned the same to me, till all of them were <br>served. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>held the,goblet in his own hand, smiied at me, and re- <br>marked, 'Only two of us are left now!' 'Quite so', I re-<br>plied. 'Then take it,' he said. I needed no second <br>bidding, and took enough. He exhorted me to have <br>more, and I had my fill; till I declared that I had no <br>room for any more. He then took hold of the bowl, and <br>drained the still remaining milk.\" <br>I <br>8. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) opinion <br>about two persons: <br>Some people were sitting with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) when a person passed that way. The <br>Prophet (Sailallaho alaihe wasallam) asked of the company: <br>I <br>\"What do you think of this person?\" <br>They replied: <br>, <br>\"0.Pro het of Allah! He is the scion of a good family. <br>: <br>By Alla R, he is such that if he seeks in marriage the <br>hand of a woman of the most illustrious family, ne <br>would not be rejected. If he recommends anybody, his <br>recommendation would be readily accepted.\" <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>people, are far from the path of Allah. It is said in Hadith: <br>\"It will be the end of this world when there remains <br>not a single soul to hymn the name of Allah. It is by <br>the holy name of Allah that the system of this universe <br>is running.\" <br>9. \t<br>Privations go with love for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) <br>A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! I love you so much.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Think well before you say this.\" <br>The person: <br>\"I have already given thought. I love you very much, <br>0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Think once <br>again before you declare such a thing.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con- <br>tingent with food, Hadhrat Qais (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>buying three camels daily from his own men, to feed the <br>Mujahideen, with a promise to pay on return to Madinah. <br>The Amir seeing that the slaughter of camels would de- <br>prive the party of their only means of transport, prohibited <br>him to do so. He collected the dates that had been left with <br>each person and stored them in a bag. He would issue one <br>date to each man as his daily ration. When Hadhrat Jahir <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) later on narrated this story to the <br>people, one of his aud?ence inquired: <br>\"How did you manage to live upon one date only for <br>the whole day?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"We longed even for that one date, when the whole <br>stock was exhausted. We were on the verge of starva- <br>tion. We moistened the dry tree-leaves with water and <br>ate them.\" <br>When they reached this stage, Allah had mercy on them, <br>for He always brings ease after every hardship, provided it <br>is endured patiently. A big fish known as \"Ambar\" was <br>thrown out of the sea for them. The fish was so big that <br>they lived on it for eighteen days altogether. They also <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 73 2- 4<br>2 s  <br>filled their satchels with the remaining portion, which -22 <br>lasted them right up to Madinah. When the episode was $2<br>* <br>narrated to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he <br>said: <br>\"The fish was a provision arranged for you by Allah.\" <br>Difficulties and hardships are not uncommon in this <br>world to the people of Allah; these are bound to come. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"The worst trials in this world are reserved for the <br>Prophets, then for those who are next to them, and <br>then for those who are best of the rest.\" <br>The trial of a person is proportionate to his position near <br>Allah, and He bestows solace and comfort by His Grace and <br>Mercy after each trial. Look how much our ancestors in <br>Islam have suffered in the path of Allah. They had to live <br>on leaves of trees, starve and shed their blood in the service <br>of the true faith, which we now fail to preserve. <br><br>r <br>CHAPTER IV <br>PIETY AND SCRUPULOUSNESS <br>The habits and traits of character of the Sahabah, as a <br>whole, are worth following, as they were the people <br>specially chosen and selected by Allah to be the compan- <br>ions of His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been sent in the best period of human history.\" <br>The time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>itself a blessed period, and the people favoured with his <br>company were really the cream of that age. <br>? <br>1. \t The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepts a <br>woman's invitation: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) 'was once re- <br>turning from a funeral, when a woman invited him to par- <br>take of some food at her house. He went in with some of <br>his Sahabah. When the food was served, it was noticed that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was trying to <br>chew a morsel, but it would simply not go down his throat. <br>He said: <br>\"It seems that the animal has been slaughtered without <br>the permission of its owner.\" <br>The woman said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I had asked a man to purchase a <br>goat for me from the market, but he could not obtain <br>one. My neighbour also had recently purchased a goat. <br>So I sent the man thither with some money to buy the <br>! <br>same from him: My neighbour was out and his wife <br>made over the goat to my man.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) directed her to go <br>and serve the meat to the captives. <br>It has been noted of pious and saintly Muslims that <br>I <br>food obtained from doubtful sources would simply not go <br>down their throats. So this is not such a surprising thing in <br><br>the case of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who is <br>the fountain-head of all piety. <br>2. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Sleepless <br>Night: <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spent a <br>sleepless night. He would turn from side to side and could <br>not sleep. His wife asked him: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Why can you not sleep?\" <br>He responded: <br>\"A date was lying about. I took it up and ate it, lest it <br>should be wasted. Now I am troubled lest it might be <br>from Sadaqah.\" <br>Most probably the date belonged to the Prophet him- <br>self, but because people sent him their 'Sadaqah' as well <br>(for distribution), he could not sleep with the apprehension <br>that it might be of Sadaqah. This is the last word in <br>scruples from the master himself, that he could not sleep <br>because of a suspicion in his mind. How would it go with <br>those who claim themselves to be the slaves of that very <br>master but indulge in usury, corruption, theft, plunder and <br>every other type of 'haraam' business without the least <br>scruple. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and a sooth- <br>sayer's food: <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had a slave <br>who used to give him a portion of his daily income as the <br>masier's share. Once he brought him some food, and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) took a morsel out of it. <br>Then the slave remarked: <br>\"You always enquire about the source of what I bring <br>to you, but today you have not done so.\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I was feeling so hungry that I failed to do that. 'Tell <br>me now, how did you come by this food?\" <br>The slave said: <br>\"Before I embraced Islam, I practised sooth-saying. <br>During those days I came across some people for <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'The flesh nourished by haraam food, is des- <br>tined for the fire of Hell.' I, therefore, made haste to <br>vomit this morsel, lest any portion of my body should <br>receive nourishment from it.\" <br>Many stories of this nature have been reported about <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). As he was very <br>scrupulous and would not taste anything but that about <br>which he was perfectly sure, even the slightest doubt about <br>its being 'halal' would make him vomit what he had taken. <br>4. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) vomits out milk <br>of Sadaqah: <br>A person once brought some milk for Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). When he took it, he noted its queer <br>taste, and asked the person as to how he had come in pos- <br>session of the milk. He replied: <br>\"The camels given in Sadaqah were grazing in the <br>desert, and the attendants gave me this milk out of <br>what they got from them.\" <br>LJpon this. I-iadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) put his hand <br>in his throat and vomited all that he had taken. <br>These God-fearing people not only totally abstained <br>from 'haraam' food. but were most anxious to avoid anv <br><br>w <br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>3s:<br>%d<br>i;<br>doubtful morsel finding its way inside them. They could <br>.c2~<br>not dare taking anything that was 'haraam', which is so <br>usual these days. <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Bait-ul-Maal: <br>Ibn-Seereen writes: <br>\"When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he said to his daughter, Hadhrat Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), 'I did not like to take anything <br>from the Bait-ul-Maal, but Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) insisted on it, to relieve me of my occupation, <br>and to enable me to devote nly full time to the duties <br>of the 'Khilafat: and I was left no choice. Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"May Allah bless your father! He has left no chance for <br>anybodv to open his lips against him.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) received his <br>subsistence allowance from the Bait-ul-maal in the interest <br>of all the Muslirns, and that too at the request of the most <br>prominent Sahabah. Again the amount taken was almost <br>the minimum possible, and hardly sufficient for him, as we <br>have already seen in the story (in the last chapter) about his <br>wife's inability to cook one sweet dish during the whole <br>month. In spite of all this he was so scrupulous that he <br>made over his garden to the Bait-ul-nlaal i l l  lieu of ~vhat he <br>had received from the public funds. <br>6. \t<br>The story of Ali bin Ma'bad: (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>Ali bin Ma'bad (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mohaddith. He <br>savs: <br>\"I was living in a rented Iiouse. Once I wrote some- <br>thing which 1 wanted to drv up quicklv. The house <br>walls were of mud and 1 intended to scrape a little <br>mud from there to dry up the ink. But I thought: \"This <br>house is not mine, and I cannot scrape the walls with- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder- <br>ness and solitude! How fare you in the other world? <br>How has it gone with you there?' He continued: 'The <br>news from our side is that all you did leave of the <br>wealth and riches here, has long been distributed; your <br>children are orphans; your widows have long since re- <br>married. Now let us hear about you.' He then turned to <br>me: '0 Kumail! If they could speak, they would have <br>informed us that the best provision for the Hereafter is <br>Taqwa.' Tears yelled out of his eyes, as he added: '0 <br>Kumail! The grave is a container of the deeds; hut one <br>realizes it only after death.\" <br>Our good or bad actions are stored up in our graves. It <br>is said in a Hadith that every person meets his good deeds <br>in the grave in the person of an agreeable companion who <br>befriends and consoles him there. But his wicked deeds <br>assume hideous shapes emitting bad smells, which add to <br>his misery. In another Hadith it is said: <br>\"Three things accompany a person to his grave viz: His <br>wealth (as was the prevalent custom among the Arabs <br>of the time), his relatives, and his deeds. His wealth <br>and his relatives turn back after his burial, but his ac- <br>tions go in and stay with him in the grave.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else,' This brother is his <br>wordly wealth. He then questions the last brother in <br>the same strain, who makes response: 'I shall not for- <br>sake you even in your grave; and I shall accompany <br>you into that place of utter solitude. When your deeds <br>are weighed in the balance. I shall forthwith lend my <br>weight to the scale of your good deeds and weigh it <br>down.' This brother is the personification of his good <br>deeds. Now, tell me, which of the brothers you regard <br>to be the most useful to the person?' The Sahabah re- <br>plied: '0, Prophet of Allah! The last brother is really <br>the most useful to him. There is no doubt about it. The <br>other two brothers were of no avail.\" <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) verdict <br>about haraam food: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"As Allah Himself is above all blemishes, likewise. He <br>blesses with His grace only the unblemished thi~igs. He <br>enjoins upon the Muslims, what He has laid 3own for <br>His Prophets. He savs in His Holy Book: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah <br>does sometimes grant the prayers of even a Kafir (not to <br>mention the prayer or requests of a sinful Muslim). but it is <br>pnrticularlv the prayer of a pious person that is seldom re- <br>jected. That is the reason why people generally seek the <br>prayers of such persons for themselves. It follows that <br>those who wish to have their prayers often granted must <br>abstain from haraam. No wise person would like to run the <br>risk of his prayers being rejected. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) does not like his <br>wife to weigh musk: <br>I-ladhrat (Jmar (Kadhiyallaho anhn) once received some <br>nli~skfrom Bahrain. I-le said: <br>\"I tvant someone to weigh it, so that it mav be equally <br>distri1)uted among the Muslims.' <br>llis ~viit? said: \"1 shall weigh it..\" <br>tiiiclhriit Umar (Kadhivallaho anho) kept quiet. A little later <br>ht: again asked for someone to weigh the musk, and again <br>his wife volullteered to do so. But he kept quiet this tiine <br>too. C'lrhen she repeated her offer for the third time, he said: <br><br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>\"I do not like your touching the musk with your hands <br>(while weighing it) and rubbing those hands on your <br>body afterwards, as that would amount to something <br>over and above my legitimate share.\" <br>Any other person weighing the musk would, for that <br>matter, have had the same advantage, but Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) did not like this preference particu- <br>larly for any member of his own family. Look at this scru- <br>pulous anxiety to avoid charge of selfishness. <br>A similar story is related about Hadhrat Umar bin <br>Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) (who is known as the <br>second Umar). While he was holding the reins of the Khila- <br>fat, musk belonging to the Bait ul-Maal was being weighed. <br>He closed his own nostrils, with the remark: <br>\"The use of musk is to smell it.\" <br>These were the scruples of the Sahabah, and their suc- <br>cessors, and our elders in Islam. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>dismisses a governor: <br>Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) ap- <br>pointed a person as governor of a province. Somebody re- <br>marked that this person had held the same post under <br>Hajjaj-bin-Yusuf (the notorious blood shedder) also. Hadh- <br>rat Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) immediately <br>issued orders of his dismissal. The man protested: <br>\"I had been with Hajjaj only for a very short time.\" <br>To this, the Khalifa replied: <br>\"His company for a day or even less is sufficient t~ <br>render a man unfit for public service.\" <br>\"A man is known by the companv he keeps.\" The <br>company of pious people leaves an imperceptible impres- <br>sion of piety on the character, and likewise evil company <br>has its evil influence. That is why association with bad <br>people is always discouraged. Even the companv of ani- <br>mals is not without its own effect. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\" <br><br>CHAPTER V <br>DEVOTION TO SALAAT <br>Salaat is the most important of all forms of worship. It <br>is, in fact, the first and foremost item to be reckoned with <br>on the Day of Judgement. .The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the only line of demarcation between Kufr <br>and Islam.\" <br>There are many Ahadith about Salaat, which. I have col- <br>lected in a separate book. <br>1. \t Blessings of Nafl (non-obligatory) Prayers: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reported that <br>Allah told him: <br>\"My wrath descends upon a person who bears ill-will <br>towards My friends. And only those are blessed with <br>My love who implicitly carry out Fardh (obligatory) in- <br>junctions. A person keeps on advancing in my esteem <br>through 'Nafl'; till I choose him as 'My beloved'. I then <br>become his ear by which he listens, his eye by which <br>he looks, his hands by which he holds, and his feet by <br>which he walks (i.e. his listening, looking, holding and <br>walking are all in perfect accord with My injunctions, <br>and he would never even dream of employing any part <br>of his body in any action contrary to My commands). If <br>such a person prays for anything, I grant it to him and <br>if he seeks My protection I do protect him.\" <br>Those people are really blessed who, after performing <br>their Fardh, are in the habit of observing Nafl profusely. <br>May Allah give me and all my friends the strength to earn <br>this blessing. <br>2. \t<br>The Propet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spends the <br>whole night in Salaat: <br>A certain person asked A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Tell <br>me something noteworthy concerning the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to <br>me these verses?' <br>'Lo! in the creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and in <br>the difference of night and day, are tokens (of His Sov- <br>ereignty) for men of understanding, such as remember <br>Allah. standing'sitting and reclining . . . (111:190-191)' \" <br>It has been reported in many Ahadith that the Pro- <br>phet's feet would get swollen because of his very long ra- <br>kaats in Salaat; people tried to reason with him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are sinless and still you <br>labour so hard!\" <br>He would reply: \"Should I not be a grateful slave of my <br>Allah, then?\" <br>3. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recitation <br>of the Qur'an in Salaat: <br>Hadhrat 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>85 sa <br>2 2  <br>\"I was once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). He brushed his teeth with a Miswak, performed <br>.g 4<br>s w<br>his Wudhu and stood up for Salaat. I also availed of * <br>the opportunity to join him. He recited surah 'Baqarah' <br>in his first rakaat; he would pray for mercy when he re- <br>cited any verse extolling the Grace of Allah, and would <br>supplicate for Divine forgiveness when reciting any <br>verse referring to His wrath. He took as much time in <br>Ruku' and Sajdah each as he had taken in Qiyaam. In <br>Ruku' he recited: <br>'Glory to Allah the Lord of Majesty, sovereignty and <br>magnificence.' <br>He recited the next three successive Soorahs in the re- <br>maining three rakaats, and each rakaat was of about the <br>same length as the first one.\" <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) has also narrated a <br>similar story about his Salaat with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam.) <br>The Qiraat (recitation) of the Qur'an by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the above mentioned four <br>rakaats amounts to more than one-fifth of he whole Qur'an. <br>And the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited the <br>Qur'an with proper intonation (Tajweed), and would also <br>pray and seek forgiveness after relevant verses. Again his <br>Ruku' and Sajdah also would last as long as his Qiyaarn. <br>We can thus have a fair idea of how much time he must <br>have taken to say his Salaat. This can only be possible <br>when Salaat is a source of great inner satisfaction and spiri- <br>tual ecstasy. That is why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) has often been quoted as saving: <br>\"The comfort of mv eyes lies in Salaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>Salaat of a Few Eminent Sahabah: <br>Hadhrat Mujahid (Radhiyallaho anho), describing the <br>Salaat of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), and that <br>of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"They stood in Salaat motionless like pieces of wood <br>stuck in the ground.\" <br>'Ulama agree that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyai- <br>laho anho) learnt to say his Salaat from Hadhrat Abu Hakr <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! The child's life was in <br>danger, and you took least notice of it.\" <br>His answer Mas: <br>\"Had I turned my attention to anything else, what <br>would have remained of the Salaat?\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was stabbed at the <br>close of his career, and this same wound caused his death. <br>He bled profusely and remained unconscious for long in- <br>tervals. But when hewas informed of the time of Salaat, he <br>would perform it in that very condition, and say: <br>\"There is no portion in Islam for the person who dis- <br>cards Salaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) would remain in <br>Salaat all night long, finishing the whole of the Qur'an in <br>one rakaat. <br>It is reported about Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that he would turn pale and tremble at the time of Salaat. <br>Somebody asked him the reason, and he said: <br>\"It is the time to discharge that trust which Allah of- <br>fered to the Heavens and the Earth and the hills, but <br>they shrank from bearing it, and I have assumed it.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>Somebody asked Khalaf-bin-Ayub: <br>\"Do not the flies annoy you in your Salaat?\" <br>His answer was: <br>\"Even the sinful persons patiently bear the lashes of <br>the government, to boast of their endurance afterwards. <br>Why should I be made to skip about by mere flies <br>when standing in the presence of my Lord?\" <br>Muslim bin Yasaar when he stood up for Salaat, said to <br>members of his family: <br>\"You may keep on talking, I shall not be knowing what <br>you talk.\" <br>Once he was saying his Salaat in the Jaami' musjid of <br>Basrah. A portion of the musjid wall fell down with a <br>crash; and eveFy body ran pel1 me11 for safety, but he never <br>even heard the noise. <br>Somebody asked Haatim Asam as to how did he say <br>his Salaat. <br>He replied: <br>\"When the time for Salaat comes, I perform my Wudhu <br>and go to the place where I have to say my Salaat. I sit <br>down for some time, till all the parts of my body are re- <br>laxed. Then I stand up for Salaat, visualising the <br>Ka'bah in front of me, imagining my feet upon the <br>Bridge of Siraat, with Paradise to my right, and Hell to <br>my left, and Izraa-eel close behind me, and thinking <br>that it may be my last Salaat. Then I say my Salaat <br>with full sincerity and devotion. And I finish my <br>Salaat between fear and hope about its acceptance. <br>5. <br>Salaat of a Muhajir and an Ansari keeping watch: <br>While returning from a campaign, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) happened to halt for the night at <br>some place. He inquired: <br>\"Who would keep watch over the camp this night?\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar bin Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) of the Mu- <br>hajirin and Hadhrat Abbaad bin Bishr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>of the Ansar offered their services. Both of them were <br>posted to watch from a hill-top against any possible night <br>attack by the enemy. <br><br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) said to Ammar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Let us keep watch and sleep turn by turn. In the first <br>half of the night I shall keep awake, while you go to <br>sleep. In the next half. you may keep watch while I go <br>to sleep.\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) agreed and went <br>to sleep, and Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) started <br>his Salaat. But an enemy scout made him out in the dark <br>from a distance. and let flv an arrow at him. Seeing that he <br>made no movernent, he shot another and still another <br>arrow at him. Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) drew <br>out arid threw away each arrow as it struck him, and at last <br>awakened his conlpanion. The enemy fled when he saw <br>them both together. fearing that there might be many more <br>of them. Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) rioticed <br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) bleeding from three places. He <br>said: <br>\"Subhanallah! whv did you not awake me earlier?\" <br>Abbaad replied: <br>\"I had started.reciting Surah 'Kahf' in my Salaat. I did <br>not like to cut it short. but when I was struck by the <br>third arrow. ,I was greatly concerned that my death <br>might jeopardise the safety of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I therefore finished the Salaat and <br>awakened you. But for this fear. I would not have gone <br>to Ruku' before finishing the Surah even if I had been <br>killed.\" <br>I <br>Look at the devotion of'the Sahaba to Salaat. One <br>arrow after another is piercing Hadhrat Abbaad's (Rad-<br>hiyallaho anho) body and he is bleeding profusely, but is <br>not prepared to sacrifice the pleasure of reciting the Qur'an <br>in his Salaat. On the other hand, the bite of a wasp, nay of a <br>mosquito, is sufficient to distract us from our Salaat. <br>According to the Hanafiyvah school of jurisprudence, <br>Wudhu breaks with bleeding, while according to the Sha- <br>fi'iyyah it does not. lt is just possible that Abbaad might be <br>having the latter view. or that this point might not have <br>been brought to an issue till then. <br><br>6. \t<br>Hadhrht Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>m<br>Salaat: \t<br>.-<br>,om <br>V1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) was once <br>saying his Salaat in his garden. His attention was drawn to- <br>wards a bird that flitted about, but could not find a way out <br>of the dense foliage. For a short moment, he followed the <br>bird with his eyes, and forgot the number of his rakaat. <br>Upon this mishap, his sorrow knew no bounds. He re-<br>paired to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pres- <br>ence straightway and submitted thus: <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah, this garden of mine has been the <br>cause of a diversion in my Salaat. I give it away in the <br>cause of Allah. Kindly spend it as may appear proper <br>to you.\" <br>A similarchance befell one of the Ansaar in the time of <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). He was saving his <br>Salaat in his garden. The branches of the trees were <br>weighed down with ripe juicy dates, luxurious abundance, <br>which caught his eyes, and he felt pleased with it. This <br>made him forget the number of his rakaat. He was so much <br>stricken with grief that he decided to part with the garden <br>that had distracted him from his Salaat. He approached <br>Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) and made over the garden to <br>him for utilising it in the path of Allah. LJsman (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) had the garden sold for fifty thousand dirhams <br>and spent the money as desired. This shows the value the <br>Sahaba set on their faith; and Hadhrat Abu Talha (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) could give away his orchard worth fifty <br>thousand dirhams because it had interfered with his Salaat. <br>According to Shah Waliullah, the Sufis give preference to <br>obedience to Allah over anything that distracts from it. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eye. A doctor told him: <br>\"A treatment is possible, provided you are willing to <br>take precautions. For five davs, it will be essential for <br>you to avoid prostrating yourself on the ground. You <br>can, however, use a wooden desk for performing <br>Sajdah.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once <br>visited the market. He noticed that at the time of Salaat, <br>everybody closed his shop and flocked to the musjid. He <br>remarked: <br>\"These are people about whom Allah has remarked: <br>\"Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when <br>hearts and eyeballs will be overturned. <br>(XXIV: 3 7)\" <br>i <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"These people were completely absorbed in their <br>trade, but when they heard Azaan they left everything <br>and hastened towards the musjid.\" \t<br>I <br>He once remarked: \"By Allah, they were such traders <br>whose trade did not hinder them from the remembrance of <br>I <br>Allah.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>91 SJZ <br>L. -<br>\"9 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>once chanced to be in the market when Azaan was called <br>3,<br>m<br>out. He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning. Again it <br>will be asked, 'who are those who kept away from their <br>beds and passed their nights in worshipping their Cre- <br>ator.' Another group will arise and enter Paradise with- <br>out any reckoning. The angel will ask yet again, 'where <br>are those whom trade did not hinder from remember- <br>ing Allah.' And yet another group will arise and enter <br>Paradise without any reckoning. After these three <br>groups have departed, and reckoning would com-<br>mence for the people in general.\" <br>9. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Khubaib, Hadhrat Zaid and <br>Hadhrat 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anhum): <br>The Qureysh writhed with fury and rage at the loss of <br>some of their greatest men in Uhud. Sulaifah, whose two <br>sons had fallen in action, had taken a solemn vow that she <br>would drink wine in the skull of 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>who had killed both of them, if she could get possession of <br>his head. She had proclaimed a prize of one hundred <br>camels (a stupendous sum for the place and the time) for <br>the person who brought 'Asim's head to her. Sufyan bin <br>Khalid worked out a plan to secure the prize. He sent a few <br>men of Adhal Waqarah to Madinah, who pretended to em: <br>brace Islam: they besought the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) to detail some persons to accompany them to <br>their locality to preach Islam to the populace. They made a <br>special request for 'Asim (Kadhiyallaho anho) saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Our people will very much appreciate his mode of <br>address.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed ten (or <br>six according to another report) of his companions to go <br>with them, and 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) was of course in- <br>cluded in these. They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations. Allah, <br>the most beloved, is with you, and your celestial <br>spouses are this minute waiting for you.\" <br>With these words, he rushed into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and when his spear broke he fought on with his <br>sword. Thus he fell fighting to the last. His last prayer was: <br>\"0,Allah! inform the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) about our fate.\" <br>Allah, in His compassion, answered his prayer by revealing <br>the news to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). As <br>'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) had come to know about Sula- <br>fah's vow to drink wine in his skull, he also prayed: <br>\"0,Allah! I have laid down my life in Thy cause: 0, <br>Allah, do save my head from the sacriligeous hands of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>This prayer was also granted. After his death, a swarm of <br>bees (or wasps according to another report) settled upon <br>his body, and foiled all attempts of the enemy to sever his <br>head. They left the body alone, intending to do their.dirty <br>job during the night, when the bees would have gone. But <br>during the night, there was a cloud-burst, which washed <br>the body away. <br>I <br><br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise. I would rather join my martyred brothers than go <br>alive with you.\" <br>He then refused to follow them in captivity. They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then. The two re- <br>maining captives were taken by them to Mecca and sold to <br>the Qureysh. Safwan bin Umayyah paid fifty camels for <br>Zaid bin Wathna (Kadhiyallaho anho] to kill him in re- <br>venge for the death of his father Umayyah in 'Uhud', and <br>Hujair bin Abi Ahaab bought Khubaib (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>for one hundred camels to avenge the fall of his father in <br>the same battle. <br>Safwan made over Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>to his slave to be killed outside the limits of the Haram. A <br>crowd followed them to watch Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anhp) meet his end, and Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also happened to be one of the spectators. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) stood prepared to meet his doom, Abu <br>Sufyan asked him thus: <br>\"Don't yo11 \\I ,11 hluhalnmad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to be in vour place today, and you be let off to <br>enjoy life with your family?\" <br>Zaid's (Kadhivallaho anho) replv amazed them all: <br>\"Hv Allah!\" he said. \"the trerv tho~~ght <br>of enjoying life <br>with nlv family is unbearable to me. if the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were even to suffer a <br>thorn-prick in his foot for that.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Qureysh simply could not understand this reply, and <br>Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"There is absolutely no parallel, anywhere in the <br>world, to the love that the companions of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bear him.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was then martyred. <br>Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the <br>captivity of Hujair for a long time. A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing <br>the child with the razor. But to remove their fears on <br>observing their alarm, Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhoj remarked: 'Do you think that I would stoop to <br>the killing of an innocent child? This heinous crime is <br>simply not possible for me.'\" <br>When he was brought to the gallows, and asked to <br>make his last wish, if any, he requested: <br>\"Allow me to say two rakaat of Salaat, for it is time for <br>me to leave the'world and meet my Allah.\" <br>They let him say his Salaat. On finishing the two rakaat <br>most calmly, he said: <br>\"But for your thinking that I was afraid of death, I <br>would have said another two rakaats.\" <br>He was then tied to the gallows. At that time he said: <br>\"0,Allah! There is nobodv to convey my last Salaam <br>to Thy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>And Allah sent his Salaam to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through an angel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) answered: <br>\"Wa alaikumus salaam! 0 Khubaib.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>3 I11<br>and observed to the Sahabah: \t<br>'C C, <br>\"Khubaib has been martyred by the Qureysh.\" <br>m <br>S m  <br>At the gallows, forty of the Querysh speared him simul- <br>taneously. One of those teased him: <br>Say by Allah, if you now wish Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) to be in your place and you to be let <br>off.\" <br>He replied: \t \"By Allah the Most Magnificent. I will not tol- <br>erate a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in ransom for my life.\" <br>Every word of this story is a lesson for us all. The de- <br>votion and love of the Sahabah narrated therein is really <br>something to esteem and covet. They would lay down their <br>very lives, but they would not tolerate even a thorn piick- <br>ing the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Again, look at <br>Hadhrat Khubaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) last wish. He <br>neither remembers his family members nor wishes to see <br>any of them; what he wishes is to send his last Salaam to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and to say two last <br>rakaats of Salaat. <br>10. Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) company in <br>Paradise: <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"1 used to remain in attendance upon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) at night. I would keep water, <br>miswak, praying mat, etc., ready for his Tahajjud. Once <br>he (being very pleased with my services) asked me, <br>'What would you wish most?' I submitted, '0,Prophet <br>of Allah. I wish your company in Paradise.' He asked <br>me if there was anything else I wished for. But I re-<br>plied. 'This is the only thing I long for.' Upon this, he <br>remarked. 'All right. You should help me by prostrat- <br>ing in prayer frequently.' \" <br>Here is a lesson for us. We should not depend on <br>verbal prayers alone, but we should also make some practi- <br>cal efforts to gain our object. The best of all efforts is Salaat. <br>Also, it would be wrong to depend entirely on the prayers <br>of saints and pious people alone. This is a world of cause <br>and effect: and, no doubt, Allah sometimes in His Wisdom <br>and Might does bring into effect things for which there is <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too). <br><br>CHAPTER VI <br>SYMPATHY AND SELF-SACRIFICE <br>The Sahabah, as a class, were an embodiment of right- <br>eousness. They attained a standard that is rather difficult to <br>emulate in a modern society. We would be fortunate if we <br>really attain even a partial resemblance to their character. <br>Some of their qualities are peculiarly their own, and self- <br>sacrifice is one of these. Allah has made a mention of this <br>in the Holv Qur'an in these'words. <br>\"They prkfer others above themselves. even though <br>poverty become their lot. (LIX: 9).\" <br>1. Feeding the guest in darkness: <br>A Sahabi came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and complained of hunger and distress. Just then, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had nothing in hand, <br>or in his home to feed him. He asked the Sahabah: <br>\"Would anybody entertain him as a guest tonight on <br>my behalf?\" <br>One of the Ansaar said: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah, I will do that.\" <br>The Ansari took the person to his house and instructed his <br>wife: <br>\"Look here, this man is a guest of the Prophet [Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We will entertain him as best as <br>we can, and won't spare anything in doing so.\" <br>The wife replied: <br>\"By Allah! I have got no food in the house, except a <br>verv little-something just enough for the children.\" <br>The Ansari said: <br>\"You lull the children to sleep without feeding them, <br>while I sit with the guest over the meagre meal. When <br>we start eating, put out the lamp pretending to set it <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight. When we sit at the meal, <br>put out the lamp, pretending to set it right, and you are <br>not to eat anything until the guest has taken his fill.\" <br>The scheme worked out as in the last story. The husband <br>and wife sat with the guest and the simple soul never sus- <br>pected in the least that neither of them had partaken at all <br>of the food, though their hands and jaws seemed to be <br>moving all right. When Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) repaired to tbe Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) presence next morning, he was greeted with the <br>happy news; <br>\"0,Thabit! Allah has very much appreciated your en- <br>tertainment of the guest last night.\" <br>3. <br>Overpaymentof Zakaat: <br>Hadhrat Ubay bin Kaab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once dep- <br>uted me to collect Zakaat dues from a locality. I went <br>to a person there, and asked about the details of his <br>possessions. A baby camel one year old was due from <br>him in Zakaat. When he heard this, he exclaimed, 'Of <br>what use is a baby camel, one year old? You can <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she-camel in-stead; which he refused to accept <br>without your permission. I have now come to you with <br>the she-camel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) observed, 'No doubt only that much is due from <br>you which he has worked out, but if you are willing to <br>give more than that, of your own accord, it would be <br>accepted.' I then presented the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which he accord- <br>ingly accepted and sought Allah's blessings for the <br>donor.\" <br>Look, with what magnanimity of heart the Sahabah <br>parted with their best things for the sake of Allah. On the <br>other hand, we too claim to be the true followers of Islam, <br>and ardent devotees of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) but, leaving apart the bestowing of alms in general <br>to the poor and the needy, we are most reluctant to pay the <br>actual obligatory dues. Zakaat, as a pillar of Islam, is not <br>even known to our upper classes. Of the middle classes, <br>only the religiously conscious strata keep up a form of <br>paying Zakaat, in as much as even the expenditure in- <br>curred on their own relatives and acquaintances, and all <br>other charitable donations squeezed out of them by the <br>force of circumstances and face-savings are debited to this <br>account. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) trying to emulate <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>for contributions in the path of Allah. In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam): <br>'How mu~h'?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Exactly one-half.' <br>By and by, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>along with his load. It transpired that he had brought <br>everything that he possessed. <br>This is what I heard: ' <br>The Prophet (Sa/lallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'What did you leave for your family, Abu Bakr?' <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'I have left Allah and his Prophet for them.' <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that on that day <br>he admitted to himself that he could never hope to surpass <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Allah says in his Holy Book. <br>\"Vie one with another in good works (V:48).\" <br>Such healthy emulation in sacrifice is therefore quite <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>101 \t & <br>b a<br>0s <br>desirable and welcome. This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well. Thereupon, I hurried as fast as I could to <br>my cousin, and, lo! in the meantime he had also joined <br>the other two. <br>j <br>U! jp,6! <br>Many an incident of such self-denial and heroic sacri- <br>fice is recorded in the books of Hadith. This is the last <br>word in self-sacrifice, that each dying person should forego <br>slaking his own thirst in favour of his other needy brother. <br>May Allah bless their souls with His choicest favours for <br>their sacrifice for others even at the time of death, when a <br>person has seldom the sense to make a choice. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) shroud: <br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dear uncle, <br>and one of his earliest supporters. Hadhrat Hamzah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) fell in Uhud, and the ruthless enemy bru- <br>tally cut off his nose, ears and vitals. He was ripped open, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it, she simply exclaimed, <br>'Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon' and offered a prayer <br>for his soul.\" <br>In another Hadith, Hadhrat ZuLair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself narrates the incident. He says: <br>\"We rnade out a woman drawing near the place where <br>the martyrs of Uhud had been gathered. On her close <br>approach, I recognised her to be my own mother. I ad-<br>vanced to stop her, but she proved to be too strong for <br>me. She thrust me aside, with the words, 'Leave me <br>alone.' Whgn I told her that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had prohibited her from seeing the <br>dead body, she at once desisted from her purpose and <br>explained. \"Hearing the news of my brother's death, I <br>have brought a couple of sheets for his shroud. Take <br>these sheets and make use of them.' We took the sheets <br>and had begun to enshroud the body, when the dead <br>body of an Ansari named Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) caught our eyes. It was also lying close by <br>in the same condition. We considered it a shame to <br>enshroud Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) in two <br>sheets, while the body of another Muslim brother lay <br>bare. We, therefore, decided to use one sheet each for <br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of <br>sympathy, equality and self-sacrifice? Is it not shameful on <br>our part that we, who call ourselves the followers of these <br>illustrious people, do not possess any of these qualities. <br>7. <br>The Story of the Goat's Head: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"One of the Sahabah received a goat's head as a pres- <br>ent. He thought of a neighbour who had a larger family <br>and was in greater need of it thar, himself, and pre- <br>sented the same to him. 'This brother, on receipt of the <br>present, recollected yet another person whom he con- <br>sidered even more deserving than himself, and sent on <br>the head to him. The goat's head is, thus, said to have <br>changed hands no less than seven times, and at last <br>came back to the original person from whom the circu- <br>lation had started.\" <br>We learn from the $tory how poor and needy the Saha- <br>bah usually were, and yet how they indeed preferred others <br>above themselves. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\" <br>The person: <br>\"Please mind your own business.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Do tell me please. May be that I can help you.\" <br>The Derson: <br>\"If you must know, inside there is my wife groaning <br>with labour pains.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Is there anybody else to attend her?\" <br>The person: <br>\"No one.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), thereupon, got up <br>and hurried homewards. He broached the subject to his <br>wife Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) thus: <br>\"Allah has brought you an opportunity to receive great <br>blessings.\" <br>Wife: <br>' <br>\"What is it, 0,Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br><br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with <br>cooking something which those people could eat. After <br>some time, Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>called out from inside the tent, <br>\"Amir-ul-Mominin, congratulate your friend on the <br>birth of a son.\" <br>The person was much embarrassed when he heard the ad- <br>dress of 'Amir-ul-Mominin' and realized the position of the <br>person who had been serving him. But Hadhrat 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) put all his fears to rest, saying: <br>\"That is all right, there is nothing to worry about.\" <br>He then placed the pan near the tent, asking his wife to <br>take it and feed the woman. She fed her and returned the <br>pan. Then Hadhrat U'mar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked the <br>bedouin to partake of the food, as he had kept awake the <br>whole night. <br>Having rendered this service, Hadhrat U'mar (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) returned home with his wife, telling the person <br>\"Come to me tomorrow, and I shall see what I can do for <br>you.\" <br>Is there any king, nay a petty chief, or even an ordinary <br>middle class person of our time, who will thus take his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse, <br>\"You will not attain unto piety until you spend of that <br>which Ye love (111: 92).\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) repaired to the <br>I<br>Prophet's presence and thus opened his heart, <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I love Bir Ha very much. As <br>Allah wants us toppend precisely that which we love, <br>I make over that garden to be spent in the path of Allah <br>as you please.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was very much <br>pleased, and remarked: <br>\"What a fine present (to Allah)! I think it would be <br>best utilized if you distribute it among your own <br>heirs.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and acted <br>upon the Prophet's advice. <br>. <br>Are we prepared to part with any of our dear things for <br>l<br>the sake of Allah so quickly, after reading a verse of the <br>I <br>Qur'an or listening to a well-delivered sermon? <br><br>Ch.

But, when an occasion of public spending <br>like marriage comes round, we are eager to win popularity <br>even if we have to take a loan on interest. <br>10. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) reprimands his <br>servant: <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) was well <br>known for his piety and abstinence. He kept no money <br>with him, and likewise did not like others to hosrd it. He <br>was always fighting against the moneyed class. Hadhrat <br>Usman, (Radhiyallaho anho), therefore, during his caliph- <br>ate advised him to shift to Rabzah (a small village in the <br>desert). He had a few camels to live on, and an old servant <br>to look after them. A tribesman from Banu Sulaim onca <br>presented himself with a request: <br>\"I wish to stay with you to benefit from your knowl- <br>edge of Allah's commandments and the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) ways and habits; I shall also <br>help your servant in looking after the camels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"I cannot keep with me a person who does not comply <br>with my wishes; but if you can always do as bidden, <br>you may remain with me, else I wish good-bye to you.\" <br>The person asked: <br>\"In what way do you like me to carry out your <br>wishes.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"When I ask you to spend from my belongings, you are <br>required to spend the best of them.\" <br>The person says, \"I accepted Hadhrat Abuzar's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) condition and stayed on with him. One <br>day, somebody informed him that there were some poor <br>folk camping near the spring close-by and were in dire <br>need of food. He asked me to fetch a camel. Accordingly, I <br>went and intended to select the best of the lot, as I had <br>pledged to do. It was a very fine and submissive animal <br>and good for riding. so I decided to let it be, and selected <br>the second best, as after all it was only to be slaughtered <br>and eaten and, for this purpose, just as good as the other. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I: \t<br>'I did not forget you instructions, but thought it better <br>to preserve the one for transport duties, while the <br>other was as good for eating.' <br>Abuzar: 'Was it for my personal need that you left it?' <br>I: \t<br>'Yes.' <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Come, let me tell you the occasion of my needs. That <br>is the day when I shall be laid all alone in the solitude <br>of the grave. Remember, there are three partners in <br>your wealth, viz. (1)Your destiny, which does not wait <br>to take away its share. Good or bad it would take away <br>all that it has to take. (2) Your heirs, who are waiting <br>for the day of your death, so that they may take over <br>their share, and (3) Yourself. If you can manage, don't <br>be the most helpless of the three partners. Take your <br>full share, while you can. Allah says: <br>'Ye will not attain unto piety until you spend of tnat <br>. \t<br>which you love. (111: 92). I, therefore, think it advisable <br>to send in advance the things which I love best, so that <br>they may be in safe deposit for me there.' <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>u <br>Ch.

It is very <br>seldom that the heirs give away in the path of Allah the <br>wealth inherited from another person, so that his soul may <br>benefit by it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>remarked: <br>\"Man cherishes his worldly belongings, hugging them <br>to his soul, and gloating, 'my wealth, my wealth,' but <br>in reality only that much of it is his wealth, which he <br>either enjoys in the form of food or dress or spends in <br>the path of Allah to be stored up for him in the Here- <br>after. What is left of his wealth belongs to others; he is <br>only acting as a custodian.\" <br>In another Hadith, it is reported that once the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired of the Sahabah. <br>\"Which of you would rather like to see his wealth in <br>the hands of his heirs than keep it with himself?\" <br>They replied: \"Who would like to be such a person, 0<br>Prophet of Allah? (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex-<br>plained: <br>\"Whatever you send in advance by spending it in the <br>path of Allah is yours, and whatever is left behind be- <br>longs to your heirs.\" <br>11. The Story of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far and Hadhrat <br>.Abdullah Bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma): <br>Hadhrat Ja'far Tayyar (Radhiyallaho anho) is a cousin <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a brother of <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). His whole family is re- <br>nowned for magnanimity, generosity, valour and heroism, <br>but Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) had a special love <br>for the poor and often mingled and associated with them. <br>He emigrated to Abyssinia with the other Muslims at the <br>time of the persecution by Qureysh, and he was the spokes- <br>man who so successfully defended the emigrants in the <br>court of the Negus. This story we have already given in <br>Chapter I. After returning from Abyssinia, he emigrated to <br>Madinah and was martyred in the expedition of Mootah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity <br>just then and this grieved him very much. Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) purchased the whole lot through <br>his agent, and distributed it (free) among the people. He <br>always acted as a host to all the strangers who were <br>stranded in the city during the night. <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), when participat- <br>ing in his last battle, called his son Hadhrat Abdullah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to his side and confided to him that he had <br>a premonition that this was going to be his last fight, in <br>which he was destiried to fall, adding that if it turned out <br>to be so, Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) was to <br>clear all his debts. He further admonished his son to call <br>upon his 'Master' if he encountered any difficulty in doing <br>so. His son, a bit puzzled, inquired as to who his Master <br>was? \"Allah,\" replied Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>The same day he met his fate. When Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) checked the accounts of his <br>father, he discovered debts that amounted to no less than <br>two million dirhams. Having the reputation of being as <br>honest and trustworthy a person as any that ever breathed, <br>people flocked to him for the safe deposit of their money. <br>He invariably address them like this: <br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>8 <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money <br>was due to Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) from his father. He therefore went to him again and <br>said: <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Excuse me. It was my mistake. In fact my father owed <br>you that much money.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If that is the case, I remit the debt.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"No, I must pay it.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You may pay it at your convenience.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Will you accept some land in lieu thereof? (He had re- <br>ceived some land as his share of booty. and he wanted <br>to dispose of it.\") <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yes, if it suits you.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). says, \"I <br>made over to him a piece of waterless land. He asked his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual. <br><br>CHAPTER VII <br>VALOUR AND HEROISM <br>Fear of death was unknown to the Sahabah. They were <br>therefore most fearless and valorous. A person who can <br>look death in the face can meet all situations. There is left <br>for him no attraction in the wealth of this world, and no <br>fear of an enemy. I wish I could inherit this quality from <br>these true heroes. <br>1. \t Ibn Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) and Sa'd (Radhiyal- <br>laho d o )  Pray for Each Other: <br>On the eve'of Uhud, Abdullah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"0.Sa'd! come, let us pray together. Let each pray to <br>Allah for the grant of his sole desire, and the other <br>would say Ameen to it. This way, the praye:s are more <br>likely to be answered by Allah.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) agreed, and they both went to a <br>corner to pray. <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was first to pray, saying: <br>\"0,Allah, when the battle rages tomorrow, let me face <br>a very strong and fierce enemy. Let him attack me with <br>might and main, and let me repulse him with all my <br>strength. Then 0,Allah, let me be triumphant by kill- <br>ing him for your sake, and allow me to have his pos- <br>sessions as booty.\" <br>Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) said; \"Ameen .\" <br>Then Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anno) started his prayer, <br>saying: <br>\"0,Allah, let me face one of the toughest fighters <br>among the enemy tomorrow. Let him attack me with <br>full fury and let me attack him with my full strength. <br>Then let him have the upper hand and kill me. lie may <br>cut my nose and ears from my body. And when I <br>appear before You on the day of Judgement, You may <br>ask me, 'How did you lose your nose and ears, 0,Ab-<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2. Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) valour in Uhud: <br>Neglect of the Prophet's orders changed the victory at <br>Uhud into a defeat, the details of which we have already <br>seen in Chapter I. That was a very hard time for the Mus- <br>lims. They were simply caught between the two groups of <br>the enemy, and many were killed. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was surrounded by the enemy, who <br>spread the rumour that he had died. Most of the Sahabah <br>lost their balance of mind at this rumour, and that was the <br>main cause of their c6nfusion. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were surrounded by the enemy, and I could not <br>see the Prophet (sallalaho alaihe wasallam). I first sea- <br>rched for him among the living and then among the <br>I <br>dead, but I could not find him. I said to myself, 'It is <br>impossible for him to fly from the battle-field. It seems <br>that Allah is angry with us due to our sins, and He has <br>lifted him up to the heavens. There is no way left for <br>me except to jump into the enemy lines and fight till I <br>am killed.' I therefore attacked the enemy, clearing <br>them with my sword till I caught sight of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); I was very happy and was <br>sure that Allah had been protecting him through His <br><br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both.\" <br>Look at the valour of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He jumps into the enemy lines singlehanded, when he is <br>unable to find the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>This also shows his extreme love and devotion to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>3. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anhoj is martyred <br>When the battle of Uhud started, Hadhrat Hanzalah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had just been wedded and therefore <br>did not join the battle from the beginning. It is said that he <br>had just left the bed of his wife and had hardly started <br>taking his bath, when he heard somebody breaking the <br>news about the defeat. He postponed the bath and, with <br>sword in hand, rushed towards the battle-field. He jumped <br>into the enemy concentration, fighting and penetrating till <br>he was killed. Now the body of the person killed in the <br>path of Allah is not washed, unless a bath has been incum- <br>bent on him before his death. Not knowing his failure to <br>take the bath incumbent on him, the Sahabah buried him <br>without a wash. Just before his burial, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I see the angels washing Hanzalah's body.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>very much to join the battle. People said to him: <br>\"You ar excusable, as you are lame. You need not go <br>to the battle.\" <br>He replied: \t \"How sad! that my sons go to Paradise, and I <br>stay behind.\" <br>His wife also wanted him to fight and get martyred, so that <br>she might have the honour of being the widow of a martyr. <br>To exhort him, she said to him: <br>\"I do not believe that people have stopped you from <br>going. It seems that you are yourself afraid to go to the <br>battlefield.\" <br>Hearing this, Hadhrat 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) equipped <br>himself with arms and, facing Qiblah, prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>He then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said: <br>\"I had always wished for martyrdom, but my people <br>have always been stopping me from going into the <br><br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud, <br>again and again. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was informed of this, he said: <br>\"The camel is charged to do that. Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam. In the battle of <br>Uhud, Musab (Radhiyallaho anho) held the flag of Islam. <br>When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in <br>confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. <br>An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the <br>flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at <br>once took the flag in the other hand. The enemy then cut <br>the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with the <br>help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his <br>body with an arrow. He fell dead and, with him fell the flag <br>that he had not allowed to fall while he was alive. Another <br>Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, <br>he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too <br>short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the <br>feet would be exposed, and when it was drawn to cover the <br>feet, the head would become uncovered. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Cover his head with the sheet, and his feet with 'Azk-<br>har'leaves.\" <br>Such was the end of the youth who was brought up in <br>luxury and comfort. The person who used to wear a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams does not have sufficient cloth <br>to cover his dead body. Look! With what valour he tried to <br><br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind <br>in Madinah. Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was very <br>brave and considered to be one of the heroes of Arabia. Iraq <br>was a part of the Persian Empire and Yazdjard was the Em- <br>peror at that time. He sent for one of his best generals <br>named Rustam and charged him with the task of checking <br>the Muslim advance. Rustam tried to avoid going to the <br>front, because of the fear of the Muslims, and requested the <br>Emperor again and again to keep him back, saying: <br>\"I shall make arrangements for the despatch of re-<br>inforcements and shall be of use to your Majesty at the <br>time of counsel.\" <br>But the Emperor did not agree, and he had to go to the <br>battlefield. <br>When Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>leave Madinah, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gave <br>him the following instructions: <br>\"0,Sa'd! Let this fact not beguile you that you are one <br>of the trusted companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and that people call you his uncle. <br>Allah does not repel evil with evil, but He repels evil <br>with good. Allah has no relation with His creation. All <br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\" <br>Ask the people who are addicted to liquor, how much <br>they love to taste it. The Sahabah loved to meet death in <br>the Path of Allah even more. This was the chief cause of <br>their success. <br>7. \t Hadhrat Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) was a shepherd <br>and had been a ~usl\"lm for some time. He lived in his vil- <br>lage in the desert. He came to Madinah to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was accompanied by his <br>nephew and his herd of goats, which he had tied with a <br>rope. He learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was in Uhud. He left his goats and went to Uhud to <br>fight by the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). A group of the enemy was at that time advancing to <br>attack the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet announced: <br>b <br>\"The person who disperses these people will be my <br>companion in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) attacked them fiercely <br>and repulsed all of them. A second and third group of the <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>121 2 3  <br>0s<br>I<br>enemy tried to advance, and each time it was Hadhrat <br>.gs<br>Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) who fought them and put them <br>$ g<br>m<br>to flight single handed. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) gave him good tidings of Paradise. No sooner did <br>he hear this, than he jumped into the enemy lines and <br>fought till he was no more. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I have never seen a person fighting so bravely and <br>fearlessly as Wahb did. I saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) standing beside his dead body, <br>saying, '0Wahb! You have pleased me. May Allah be <br>pleased with you.\" <br>Although the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself <br>was wounded in this battle, yet he buried Wahb's body <br>with his own hands. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to say: <br>\"I never envied anybody more than Wahb (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho). I wish I could appear before Allah with a <br>record as good as his.\" <br>What is it in the life of Hadhrat Wahb (Radhivallaho <br>anho) that makes an illustrious and exalted person like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to envy him. It is the <br>same spirit of sacrifice for the sake of Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even though Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and other Sahabah have better <br>deeds. <br>8. \t<br>Tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona. <br>In the tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona, seventy Sahabah were <br>massacred. All of them were Hafiz of Qur'an. Their Jama'at <br>was called the Jama'at of Qwaa and consisted mostly of <br>Ansaar. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) loved them <br>very much, for they engaged themselves in Zikr and recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an during the night, and attended upon the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his family during <br>the day. A person named Amir bin Malik and known as <br>Abu Bara, belonging to Bani Amir clan of Najd, came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took this Jama'at <br>with him for the Tabligh and the Ta'leem of his clan. The <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better <br>than of three.\" <br>'Amir bin Tufail was the nephew of 'Amir bin Malik, who <br>had brought the Jama'at. He was a bitter enemy of Islam <br>and hated the Muslims to the core. When Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) delivered the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) epistle to him, he did not even care to <br>read it and attacked Hadhrat Haraam (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>with his spear, which pierced through the latter's body. <br>Hadhrat Haraam (RadHiyallaho anho) uttered \"By the Lord <br>of the Ka'bah, I have triumphed,\" and died. The heartless <br>person had no consideration for the guarantee given by his <br>uncle, nor for the accepted tradition all over the world, that <br>nobody would kill the envoy. He then assembled the <br>people of his clan and exhorted them to kill all the Saha- <br>bah camping at Bi'r Ma'oona. The people hesitated, in view <br>of the guarantee given by 'Amir bin Malik. He collected a <br>large number of people from the neighbouring tribes and <br>attacked the Muslims. They massacred each one of them, <br>except Hadhrat Ka'b bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>had some life left in him and the enemy left him as dead. <br>Hadhrat <br>Munzir <br>and <br>Hadhrat <br>Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), while grazing the camels, noticed vultures hover- <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made, 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) free and let him go. 'Amir bin Fuhairah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave of Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), was <br>also among those who were killed at Bi'r Ma'oona. Jabbar <br>bin Salmi, who killed him says: <br>When I thrust my spear through him, he uttered, 'By <br>Allah, I have triumphed and to my amazement I saw <br>his body lifted upwards towards the sky. I made enqui- <br>ries later on as to what was the triumph that 'Amir bin <br>Fuhairah (Radhiyallaho anho) meant when he uttered, <br>'By Allah, I have triumphed.' I was told that it was that <br>of entering into Paradise. This made me embrace <br>Islam. <br>These are the illustrious people, of whom Islam is <br>rightly proud. Death had really more attraction for them <br>than wine for their enemies. As they did deeds which were <br>sure to win Allah's pleasure, they felt most triumphant at <br>the time of surrendering their souls. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up Eating <br>Dates. <br>In Badr, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>sitting in a tent. He exhorted the Sahabah to fight, saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time. I <br>cannot do that.\" <br>Saying this, he threw away the dates, and with sword in <br>hand jumped into the battle-field and fought till he was <br>killed. <br>In fact, these people appreciated the value of Paradise, <br>for their Yaqeen was firm. If we too get that Yaqeen in our <br>hearts, nothing will be too difficult or too much for us. <br>10. \t Hadhrat 'Umar's IRadhiyallaho anho) Emigration to <br>Madinah. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) is well known for <br>his valour and heroism by one and all. When the Muslims <br>were very weak in the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) prayed to Allah to strengthen the Mus- <br>lims with Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Islam. This <br>prayer was answered by Allah in no time, as we have seen <br>in Chapter I. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma'sood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"We could not say our Salaat in the Haram till %mar <br>had accepted Islam.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I \t<br>! <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was naturally very much upset when <br>the news reached him. He collected an army, 3 000-strong, <br>to advance against the enemy. While nominating Hadhrat <br>Zaid bin Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) to command the <br>army, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"If Zaid is killed, then Ja'far bin Abi Talib will be your <br>Amir and if he is also martyred, then Abdullah bin Ra- <br>wahah will take the command. If he also dies, then you <br>can select a commander from among yourselves.\" <br>A Jew, who was listening to this, said: <br>\"All the three must die. This is exactly how the earlier <br>Prophets used to prophesy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave Hadhrat <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) a white flag made by himself. He <br>then accompanied the army for some distance out of Madi- <br>nah and prayed for them saying: <br>\"May Allah bring you back safely and triumphantly. <br>May He guard you against all evils.\" <br>At that moment, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was o poet too. recited three couplets. <br>which meant: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred. We have never <br>fought by dint of our strength in arms and numbers. <br>We have always fought on the score of Islam, through <br>which Allah has exalted us. You are sure of one of the <br>two triumphs: Victory or Martyrdom.\" <br>Thus exhorted by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the Sahabah decided to advance till <br>they faced the Christian army in the battle-field of Moota. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with flag in his hand di- <br>rected the field operations. A fierce battle raged; Sharjeel's <br>brother was killed in action. Sharjeel himself fled from the <br>field and took shelter in a fort. He sent a message to the <br>Caesar, who immediately despatched for his help and an <br>army, which was 200 000-strong. The Muslims were fight- <br>ing against very heavy odds. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was killed and the flag was taken over by Hadhrat <br>Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho). He intentionally disabled his <br>horse to dispel any idea of returning home from the battle- <br>field. He then recited a few couplets, which meant: <br>\"0,people! What a beautiful place is Paradise. And <br>how happy is its approach! How fine and how cool is <br>its water. The Roman's doom is at hand, I must finish <br>them all.\" <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>With flag in one hand and sword in the other, he jumped .$<br>into the enemy lines. The enemy cut his right hand, which 8~<br>held the flag. He at once transferred it to his left. When that <br>was cut off, he held the flag in his teeth and supported it <br>with his bleeding arms. His body was cut into two by <br>somebody from behind and fell dead. He was thirty-three at <br>that time. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When we removed him from the battle-field, we <br>counted as many as ninety wounds on his body--all <br>on the front side.\" <br>When Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was eating <br>a piece of meat in a corner of the battle-field. He had been <br>hungry for three days. On hearing about Hadhrat Ja'far's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) death, he threw away that piece of <br>meat, saying to himself: <br>\"Abdullah! You are busy in eating. while Ja'far has <br>reached Paradise.\" <br>He took the flag and began to fight. His finger was severely <br>injured and hung loose. He put the hanging finger under <br>his foot and tore it off from the hand, and then rushed for- <br>ward. Knowing the Muslims were fighting against very <br>overwhelming odds, and his own weakness, made him <br>pause for a moment. He at once recovered from his despair <br>and said to himself: <br>\"0, Heart! what makes you tarry now? Is it for the love <br>of wife? If so, then I divorce her this very moment. Is it <br>for the slaves? Then I set them all free. Is it for the <br>garden? I give it over in Sadaqah. He then recited a few <br>couplets, which meant: '0,Abdullah! You have to go <br>down after all; whether you do it willingly or unwil- <br>lingly. You have had enough of peace. 0,you, who are <br>only a drop of dirty fluid! See how the disbelievers are <br>assaulting the Muslims. Why does Paradise not entice <br>you? Even if you are not killed in this battle, remem- <br>ber, you have to die one day.\" <br>He then got down from his horse. Meanwhile his cousin <br>brought him a slice of meat, sayin \"You have had neither <br>sleep nor food for so many days. %at thiranrftake a little <br>rest before you fight.\" He held the slice and was about to <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>I<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings, <br>never lagged behind in propagating the faith, yet we treat <br>them as the worst among rulers because of the contrast <br>with the just and God-fearing rulers. He was the viceroy of <br>king Abdul Malik bin Marwan for Hijaz and Iraq. The king <br>lived in Damascus and Hajjaj had his headquarters at <br>Koofah. Saeed bin Jubair had fought against Hajjaj on the <br>side of Ibnul Ash-ath. After the defeat. Saeed (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) ran away and took asylum in Mecca. The Govern- <br>ment posted a very stern person as the Governor of Mecca, <br>with instructions to'arrest Saeed. The Governor assembled <br>all the people of Mecca and read before them the order of <br>Abdul Malik, which said: <br>\"Any person who gives shelter to Hadhrat Saeed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) shall meet the same fate as Hadhrat <br>Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) himself.\" <br>He then announced to the people: <br>\"By Allah, I must kill the person who gives shelter to <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullah alaih). His and his neigh- <br>bours houses shall be razed to the ground.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was arrested with great <br>difficulty and sent to Koofah. When he was brought before <br>Hajjaj, the following conversation took place: <br><br>Ch. VII:, Valour and Heroism <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My name is Saeed (lit. auspicious).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your father's name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Jubair (lit. Trimmed).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"No, you are in fact Shaqi (lit. wretched) <br>son of Kusair (lit. a broken thing).\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My mother knew my name better than <br>you do.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"You are wretched and your mother is also <br>wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The Knower of the hidden things is <br>Hajjaj: <br>-<br>someone else\" <br>\"Look! I am putting you to sword.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Then my mother was right in giving me <br>this name.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I shall send you to Hell.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"If I knew that you had that power. <br>would have taken you as my god.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"What is your belief about the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"He was an apostle of Mercy and a <br>Prophet of Allah, sent'with the best Guid- <br>ance for the whole creation.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What do you say about the Khalifas?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not a warder over them. Everybody <br>is responsiLle for his own actions.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Who is the most exalted of the four Khali- <br>. fahs?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The one who had been able to please <br>. Allah more than the rest.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Which of them had 'been able to please <br>Allah more than the rest?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"This is known only to Him Who knows <br>what is hidden in the bosoms and what <br>the hearts conceal.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem- <br>peraments.\" <br>\"I am now going to kill you.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The time and mode of my death have <br>already been decreed.\" <br>~ a j j a j  <br>\"Allah has preferred me to you.\" <br>f <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Nobody can be proud of his relation with <br>Allfh, unless he knows his position; and <br>Allah is the only knower of the unseen.\" <br>\"Why should I not be proud of my relation <br>Hajjaj: <br>with Allah, when I am with the Amir-ul- <br>Mominin and you are with the rebels.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am with the other Muslims. I myself <br>shun mischief, but nobody can change the <br>decree of Allah.\" <br>\"What do y0.u say about what we collect <br>Hajjaj: <br>for Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do-not know what you collect for him.\" <br>Hajjaj sent for gold, silver and dresses fiom the trea- <br>sury and showed these to Saeed. <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>131 sc <br>%2 <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"These are useful, provided you are able to <br>obtain with them the things that may pro- <br>-84 <br>$,<br>vide you peace on the Day of Consterna- <br>tion (i.e Day of Judgement), when every <br>nursing mother will forget her nursing, <br>and every pregnant one will be delivered <br>of her burden, and when nothing but good <br>will be of any avail.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Are our collections not good?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"You have collected them, and you are the <br>best judge.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Do you like any of these things for your- <br>self?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I only like the things which Allah likes.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Woe to you!\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Woe is for the person who is deprived of <br>Paradise and is made to enter Hell.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>(Annoyed): \"Say how should I kill you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"As you would like to be killed.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Should I forgive you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah's forgiveness is real. Your aforgive- <br>ness is of no value.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>(To the executioner): \"Kill this man.\" <br>Hadhrat, Saeed laughed while he was being taken for <br>execution. Hajjaj was informed of this. He called him back. <br>\"What made you laugh?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Your boldness with Allah, and His,clem- <br>ency to you. \" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I am killing a person who has caused dis- <br>sent among the Muslims. (To the ex-<br>ecutioner) Kill him in front of me.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Let me say my Salaat of two rakaats.\" <br>After finishing Salaat, he faced Qiblah and recited: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts. <br>\"Make him lie on his face. We are only re- <br>Hajjaj: <br>sponsible for appearance.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was made to lie on his <br>face. <br>Saeed: <br>\"Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return <br>you, and thqnce We bring you forth a second time.\" <br>(XX:55). <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Kill him\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: I call you to witness what I recite: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, who <br>is all alone and Who has no partner and I bear witness <br>that Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is His <br>slave and His Prophet.\" <br><br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path. <br><br>CHAPTER-VIII <br>ZEAL FOR KNOWLEDGE <br>The Kalimah is the essence of Islam and the basis for <br>all achievements. No good action is acceptable with out <br>belief in Kalimah. The Sahabah, therefore, devoted most of <br>their energy, specially in the early days of Islam, to the <br>propagation of the Kalimah and to fighting with the forces <br>that resisted it. Although their engagements left them very <br>little time to drink deep from the ocean of learning with the <br>single-mindedness demanded thereof, yet their zeal even in <br>this direction has left us a legacy in the form of knowledge <br>about the Qur'an and Hadith, which is quite highly credita- <br>ble and a glaring example. When Sahabah go) a little lei- <br>sure from the work that kept them engtiged in the <br>beginning of Islam, and also when the number of people in <br>Islam grew considerably. Allah revealed the following <br>verse in the Qur'an: <br>\"And the believers should not all go out (in the path of <br>Allah). Of every group of them, a party only should go <br>forth that they (who are left behind) may gain sound <br>knowledge in feligion and that they may warn their <br>folk when they come to them, so that they may <br>beware.\" <br>(IX: 122). <br>Hadhrat ~bdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The verses of the Qur'an which were revealed in the <br>beginning of Islam, demanding every Muslim to move <br>out in the path of Allah; for example: <br>\"If you go not forth, He will afflict you with a painful <br>doom; <br>(IX:39)\" <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>'Go forth, light and heavily armed, and strive with f 3  <br>your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah; <br>s m  <br>m<br>(IX:41).' <br>These verses were later on superceded by the foregoing <br>verse, which advised only a party from each group to leave <br>their places. <br>The Sahabah, very few in number as they were, had to <br>assume the responsibilities of Islam in all fields. Allah <br>therefore endowed them with the versatility that was <br>theirs. After the Sahabah, the Islam spread far and wide <br>and the Mu~lims swelled in number. Again, the later <br>people lacked the versatility of the Sahabah. Allah then <br>caused different people to specialize in different branches <br>of Islamic learning. Mohaddit.hin were to devote them- <br>selves to the collection and propagation of Hadith. Simi- <br>larly the Fuqaha (jurists) Soofia (Experts in Zikr), Qurraa <br>(Experts in recitation of Qur'an), Mujahidin (Fighters in the <br>path of Allah), etc, each own group had its own field to <br>take up as a whole-time task. This was very necessary at <br>that time, for otherwise different branches of Islamic learn- <br>ing would not have developed so nicely, as it is difficult for <br>one man to specialize in all the branches. The Prophets <br>(alaihimus salaam), and specially Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) the chief among them, were specially en- <br>dowed with such a capacity. This will explain why the <br>stories of other eminent personalities, besides the Sahabah <br>have also been narrated in this chapter. <br>1. Sahabah's Panel for Fatwa. <br>Although all the Sahabah, along with their engagement <br>in Jihad and propagation of faith, were devoted to acquir- <br>ing and further spreading of knowledge, yet there was a <br>panel of Sahabah who were exclusively entrusted with <br>Fatwa, even during the life tirne of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The panel comprised the following Saha- <br>bah:-<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr, Hadhrat 'Umar, Hadhrat Usman, <br>Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf. Hadhrat <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>IJbayy bin Kaab, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Hadhrat <br>Ma'aaz bin Jabal, Hadhrat Ammaar bin Yaasir, Hadhrat Hu- <br>zaifah, Hadhrat Salman Farsi, Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit, <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum). <br>To give Fatwa during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) was a big privilege for these Saha- <br>bah, and speaks of their deep and dependable knowledge. <br>2. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) burns his col- <br>lections: <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"My father (Hadhrat Abu Bakr) (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had a collection of five hundred Hadiths. One night I <br>noticed that he was very restless. He was tossing about <br>in the bed and could not sleep. I got worried over this <br>and inquired, 'Are you suffering from any trouble or <br>worried about anything.' But he did not speak and re- <br>mained restless throughout the night. Next morning he <br>called me and said, 'Bring the collection of Hadith that <br>I gave you to keep.' I brought the book and he set fire <br>to it, till it was burnt. He said, 'The collection con- <br>tained many Hadiths that I had heard from other <br>people. I thought if I died and left behind a Hadith ac- <br>cepted as authentic by me, but really not so, then I <br>should have to answer for that.\" <br>It was Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (Radhiyallaho anho) zeal for <br>knowledge, that cau2ed him to compile a book of five hun- <br>dred Hadiths. But it was due to his extreme cautiousness <br>that he burnt the collection. <br>The Sahabah were very careful and cautious about <br>Hadith. That is why you find very few Hadiths narrated by <br>eminent Sahabah; those people who do riot hesitate to <br>quote Hadith (without authority) in their sermons from the <br>pulpit should take a lesson from this story. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the Prophet's com- <br>pany for most of his time; many Sahabah say: <br>L <br>Hadhrat \"Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was the most <br>learned amongst us;\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>137 4,<br>~r * <br>0 s  <br>\"After the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>.K8 54 <br>Q*<br>sallam), when the Khalifah's selection was under con- <br>sideration, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) * <br>addressed the people quoting all those verses of the <br>Qur'an and all such Hadiths of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) which dealt with the virtues and <br>privileges of the Ansar.\" <br>This shows how much knowledge of the Qu'ran he had, <br>and how many Hadiths he remembered. In spite of all this, <br>there are very few Ahadith that have been narrated by <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). For similar <br>reasons, Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) too was <br>not so liberal in reporting Hadith. <br>3. \t Hadhrat Mu'sab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) Car- <br>ries out Tabligh. <br>A story about Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has already been given in Chapter VII. When the <br>first group of people from Madinah embraced Islam in <br>Mina, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) to go with <br>them to teach Islam and preach to others. He remained <br>busy all the time in teaching the Qur'an and other Islamic <br>practices to the people. He stayed with Hadhrat As'ad bin <br>Zararah (Radhiyallaho anho) and was known as 'Muqree' <br>(the teacher). <br>Sa'd bin Ma'az and Usaid bin Hudhairiyah, who were <br>among the chiefs of Madinah, did not like Mus'ab's activi- <br>ties. Sa'd said to Usaid: <br>You go to As'ad and tell that we do not like his having <br>brought a stranger with him to Madinah, who misleads <br>the poor and simple folk of the town.\" <br>Usaid went to Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho anho) and <br>talked to him very harshly. Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to him: <br>\"You first listen to him; if you like his teachings, you <br>may accept them; if not, you have every right to de- <br>nounce and stop him.\" <br>Usaid agreed to it. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) ex- <br>plained the virtues of Islam and recited a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before him. Usaid said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"These teachings are very fine and these verses are <br>simply beautiful. How do you admit a person to your <br>faith?\" <br>He said: \t \"You take a bath, put on clean clothes and recite <br>the Kalimah.\" <br>Usaid immediately complied with all these formalities and <br>embraced Islam. He then went to Sa'd and brought him to <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) to listen to his Tabligh. Sa'd <br>also embraced Islam. No sooner had Sa'd accepted Islam <br>than he went to people of his clan (Banu Ash-hal) and said <br>to them: <br>\"What type of person do you think I am?\" <br>They replied: \"You are the best and the noblest of <br>clan.\" <br>the <br>He then said: \"I have vowed not to talk to your men and <br>women until you all embrace Islam and be- <br>lieve in Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe was- <br>sallam).\" <br>All the men and women of Banu Ash-ha1 embraced Islam <br>then and there. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>to teach them and train them in Islam. <br>No sooner did anybody embrace Islam than he began <br>to preach it. Everyone of them considered it incumbent <br>upon him to preach and teach to others what he know <br>about Islam. His trade, farm or occupation was no barrier to <br>Tabligh. <br>4. \t Hadhrat 'Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is one <br>of the most eminent Sahabah and was an expert in the reci- <br>tation of the Qur'an. Very few Arabs were literate before <br>Islam, and he was one of these. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) used to dictate the revealed Qur'an to <br>him. He memorised the Qur'an during the life time of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and had thorough <br>. <br>understanding of it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is the <br>greatest Qari of my Ummat.\" <br><br>He used \t to finish the Qur'an once in Tahajjud in eight <br>nights. Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassalam) said <br>to him: <br>\"Allah has commanded me to recite the Qur'an to <br>you.\" <br>He said: \t \"0, Prophet of Allah! Did Allah mention me by <br>my name?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Yes, He mentioned you by your name.\" <br>Tears began to roll down his cheeks with excessive joy. <br>Hadhrat Jundub bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When I went to Madinah to acquire knowledge, I <br>found that people were sitting in groups, and each <br>group wag entrusted to a teacher. In one of the groups I <br>saw a person teaching Hadith, clad in two sheets of <br>cloth and looking like a traveller. I asked the people, <br>'Who is this person?' They said, 'He is our esteemed <br>Imam, Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho).' <br>When he finished teaching, I followed him to his <br>house. He was staying in a very old and dilapidated <br>building, with little or no furniture. I noticed Hadhrat <br>Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) living in a very simple and <br>ascetic life.' <br>Hadhrat Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Once the Prohet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) tested <br>me in my knowledge of the Qur'an. He asked me, <br>'Ubayy, which is the most august verse of the Qur'an?' <br>I said, 'Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) know best.' He again asked my the same question <br>and I gave the same modest and respectful reply. When <br>he put the same question once again, I replied, 'The <br>most august verse in the Qur'an is Ayatul Kursi (11: <br>255).' My reply made him very happy. He said, 'May <br>-<br>Allah bless you through your knowledge.' <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was leading <br>Salaat when he missed one verse. Ubayy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) pointed out the correction from behind. On finishing <br>Salaat, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired <br>'Who corrected me?' He was told that it was Hadhrat Ubayy <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>F <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He remarked, 'I also thought that it <br>was he.\" <br>In spite of his devotion to knowledge and his special <br>job of writing the Qur'an, he took part in all the battles by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He did <br>not miss a single campaign or expedition led by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Huzaifah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Anxiety Re- <br>garding Tribulations. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the <br>well-known Sahabah. He is known as 'Keeper of Secrets.' <br>The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) had confided to <br>him the names of Munafiqin, and had informed him in <br>chronological order all the tribulations which the Muslims <br>were to face till the last day. He gave him full details (viz. <br>the name of the mischief maker, his parents' names, his <br>community, etc.) about the incidents that were going to <br>affect three hundred or more people. Hadhrat Huzaifah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Other people used to -ask the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about good things, while I always <br>asked him about the adverse events, so that I might <br>guard against them.\" <br>He then narrated the following conversation with the <br>Prophet: <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Shall we revert to <br>evil, after the good that you have brought <br>us?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes. The evil is coming.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"Shall we have good again after that evil?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"Huzaiiah! Go and read the Qur'an, medi- <br>tate on its meaning and follow its com-<br>mandments.\" <br>But Huzaifah anxiety grew more and more, and he con- <br>tinued his queries about evils that were to befall the ,Mus- <br>lims. <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Tell me if good will <br>come after that evil?\" <br><br>TheProphet: \t \"Yes, good will come again, but the hearts <br>of the people will not be so clear as before.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"And will there by any evil coming after <br>this good?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes, There will be such persons who will <br>misguide the people and take them to Hell.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"What should I do if I witness that time?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"If there be a group of Muslims united <br>under one Amir, then join them, otherwise <br>dissociate yourself from all such factions <br>and be secluded in a corner, or take refuge <br>under a tree (i.e., in the forest) and be there <br>till you die.\" <br>As the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had dis- <br>closed to him the identities of the Munafiqin of that time, <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to ask him: <br>\"Is there any Munafiq among my deputies?\" <br>Heonce replied: \t \"Yes. There is one, but I shall not dis- <br>close his name.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) dismissed the man, <br>probably by his own discernment. <br>Whenever somebody died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) would inquire if Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was participating in the funeral prayer. If <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) did not do so, then Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) would also absent himself from <br>that funeral: <br>'when Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he wept in anxiety and uneasiness. People <br>said to him:- <br>\"Are you weeping over your departure <br>from this world?\" <br>He said: <br>\"No. I am not weeping over that. I love to <br>die. I weep because 1 do not know <br>whether, at this time of my departure <br>from this world. Allah is pleased with <br>me or not .\" <br>He then prayed: \"0,Allah, these are the last moments of <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>my life. You know that I have always <br>loved Thee. Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me. I <br>would be with the Prop-het (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) at times when no one else was there. I once com- <br>plained to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>about my poor memory. He said, 'Spread your shawl!' I <br>did so. He made some signs on the shawl with his own <br>hands and said, 'Now wrap this shawl around you.' I <br>wrapped it around my breast. Since then, i never have <br>forgotten anything that I have wished to remember.\" <br>The people of Suftah were residents in the Prophet's <br>mosque. They had no regular source of income. They were <br>the guests of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who <br>transferred to them the Sadaqah and shared with them the <br>gifts that he received. Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was one of them. He would, sometimes, go without food for <br>days together and sometimes would behave like a lunatic, <br>due to 5p-.cessive hunger, as we have already seen in Chap- <br>ter I1I:Iri spite of such difficulties, he was all the time occu- <br>pied in memorising the sayings of the Prophet. <br>This enabled him to narrate such a large number of <br>Ahadith Imaam Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullahi alaih) has attribu- <br>ted as many as 5 374 Ahadith to him. Once he narrated the <br>following Hadith:- <br>\"A person participating in a funeral gets one Qeeraat of <br>reward if he returns after the funeral service, but gets <br>two Qeeraats of reward if he remains there till the <br>burial is over, and one Qeeraat is weightier than mount <br>Uhud.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) heard <br>this and doubted authenticity of the Hadith, saying: <br>\"0.Abu Hurairah! Think before you speak.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) got upset over <br>this and took Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to Hadhrat 'Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), and said to <br>her: <br>\"0,Ummul-Mo'minin, I request you to say by Allah if <br>you have beard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) the Hadith regarding Qeeraats of reward?\" <br>She said: \"Yes. I have heard this Hadith.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) then said to <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"During the Prophet's time, I had no tree to plant in <br>the orchard and no merchandise to sell in the market. I <br>was always with the Prophet. My only job was to mem- <br>orise what the Prophet said, and to eat only what he <br>gave me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyal.lQho anho) said: <br>\"No doubt. Of us all, you were the most constant in at- <br>tendance to him and therefore most informed about ths <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>With all these achievements, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I recite Istighfar 12000 time daily.\" <br>He had a piece of thread with 1000 knots. He would <br>not go to sleep until he had said Subhanallah on all of <br>these knots. <br>7. \t Death of Musailamah and Compilation of QW'&. <br>Musailamah was an imposter who called himself a <br>Rrophet, even during the life time of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>laho alaihe wasallam). After the death of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), people of the weak faith, <br>especially among wandering Arabs, began to desert Islam <br>and become renegades. Musailamah took advantage of the <br>situation and succeeded in causing a large number of <br>people to fall a prey to his seduction. Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) decided to put a stop to this onslaught on Islam. <br>A fierce battle was fought with him, in which the Muslims <br>triumphed with the help of Allah, and Musailamah was <br>killed. A good number of Sahabah, including many Huffaz, <br>however, lost their lives. After this battle, Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and said: <br>\"Many Huffaz gave been slain in this battle. I am afraid <br>we are likely to lose a good portion of the Qur'an if we <br>fight a few more battles and suffer loss of Hufaaz at <br>this rate. I, therefore, suggest that the Qur'an may be <br>compiled and preserved in the form of one complete <br>book.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"How can I venture on a thing that was not done in the <br>life of the Prophet (Sall'alkaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>But Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) pressed his point <br>so much that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>agreed to it. He sent for Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and informed him of what had passed between <br>him and Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), and then said: <br>t <br>\"You are young and intelligent. Everybody considers <br>you trustworthy. Moreover you were charged by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with the writing <br>of the Qur'an during his life time. I, therefore, request <br>you to go to the people and collect the Qur'an from <br>them and compile it in the form of a book.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"By Allah, if Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anbo) had asked <br>me to shift a mountain from one place to another, it <br>would not have been so hard for me as the compilation <br>of the Qur'an. I said, 'How do you both dare to take up <br>a thing which was not done by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>145 & <br>k = <br>o*<br>alaihe wasallam)?\" They explained to me their point. .g 3 <br>till Allah made the truth dawn on me, and I also was s,<br>convinced of the importance of the task. I then started <br>going to the people and collecting the Qur'an from <br>those who had written it and from those who had <br>learnt it by heart, till the final collection was ready.\" <br>Look at the spirit of the Sahabah as regards their <br>strictly following the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Shifting of a mountain from its position was not so difficult <br>for them as doing a thing that they had not seen the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) doing. Allah gave <br>them the honour of doing the greatest service to Islam by <br>compiling the Qur'an, which is the source-book of Islam. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was so particular and <br>cautious that he would accept the fragments only when <br>these were proved to be written during the Prophet's time <br>and after they were duly oorroborated -by the recitation of <br>those who had preserved the Qur'an in their hearts. No <br>doubt, he had to go from door to door and person to <br>person, but Allah caused, thanks to his labours, every word <br>revealed by Him to be collected and compiled. He was con- <br>stantly assisted by Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), whom the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>declared a great expert in Qur'anic knowledge. The Mus- <br>lims of all times are highly indebted to the Sahabah for <br>their marvellous achievement. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood's (Radhiyallaho anho) Cautious- <br>ness About Hadith: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) is <br>one of those eminent Sahabah who were entrusted with the <br>task of issuing Fatwa, even during the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) time. He had been in the fold of Islain <br>since its advent and was one of the emigrants to Abyssinia. <br>He accompanied the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>in all his campaigns and worked as his attendant. He car- <br>ried the shoes of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>provided him with a pillow when he needed one, and <br>brought him water for his Wudhu. He was therefore cailed <br>\"The Keeper of the shoes\", \"The Keeper of Pillow\" and <br>\"The Manager for Wudhu\". The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) once said: <br>\"Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) is the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>only person whom I can safely appoint as an Amir <br>without consulting anybody.\" <br>He was permitted by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to visit him at all times. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>(1) \"If you want to recite the Qur'an as it was revealed <br>to me, then copy the recitation of Abdullah bin <br>Mas'ood.\" <br>(2) \t \"Believe in what Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>iaho anho) narrates about me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Moosa Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>mother visited the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) house so often and were so at home there that the <br>people of Yemen, who had come to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), took him as one of the <br>Ahlul Bait (family member.)\" Though he was so near <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), yet he was <br>very cautious about narrating the words of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu 'Amir Shai- <br>bani (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I stayed with Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) for one year. I never heard him attributing any <br>words direct to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Whenever he intended doing so, he would shiver <br>with fear.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Idairnoon (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I have been visiting Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) every Thursday for one year: I never heard <br>him attributing any words direct to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). Once he was narrrating Hadith. <br>When he uttered the words 'The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said so,' then his body began to <br>shiver, his eyes became full of tears, his forehead <br>sweated, his veins swelled and he said 'Insha-Allah' <br>the Prophet said so, or something like that, it might be <br>something less or something more.\" <br>Look at the Sahabah's caution and care about Hadith. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe waaallam) said: <br><br>\"A person who attributes anything to me, which I have <br>not said, is making his abode in the Hell.\" <br>This is why the Sahabah, though speaking and doing every- <br>thing according to the instructions and example of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), were afraid of attribu- <br>ting any words to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>lest they should be different from what the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) had actually uttered. On the other <br>hand, we go on quoting Ahadith without being sure of their <br>authenticity and fear not the serious consequences of at- <br>tributing wrongly anything to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). It may be mentioned that the Fiqah.Hani- <br>fiyah is based mostly on the Ahadith narrated by Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>A Person Travels from Madinah to Damascus For One <br>Hadith. <br>Kathir bin Qais narrates: <br>\"I was sitting with Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in a musjid in Damascus, when a person came to <br>him and said, '0,Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), I have come all the way from Madinah to learn <br>one Hadith from you, as I understand you have heard <br>it directly from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Have you any other business in Damascus?\" <br>The person: <br>\"No.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Are you sure that you have no other work in Damas-<br>cus?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I have come to this place with the sole purpose of <br>learning this Hadith,\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Listen. I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho aliahe <br>wasallam) saying, 'Allah eases the way to Paradise for <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>one who traverses some distance to seek knowledge. <br>The angels spread their wings under his feet, and all <br>things in heavens and earth (even the fish in the water) <br>pray for his forgiveness. The superiority of a person <br>possessing knowledge over a person doing worship is <br>as the superiority of the moon over the stars. The <br>Ulama are the inheritors of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wassallam). The legacy of Prophets (Alaihimus- <br>salaam) is neither gold nor silver. Their legacy is <br>knowledge. A person who acquires knowledge ac-<br>quires a great wealth.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu-Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) is foremost <br>among the Sahabah who possessed very sound knowledge <br>in religion. He is called 'Hakim-ul-Ummah' (The Sage of <br>Islam). He once said: <br>\"Before Islam, I lived on trade. After accepting Islam, I <br>tried to combine the service of Allah with my business, <br>but I could not do so. I therefore gave up business and <br>devoted myself solely to the service of Allah. Now if I <br>have a shop at the gate of a musjid and have no fear of <br>losing a single Salaat thereby, and even if the shop <br>gives me a daily profit of 40 dinars to spend the whole <br>lot in the path of Allah, even then I am not willing to <br>turn to business.\" <br>Somebody inquired the reason. He replied:- <br>\"Because of the fear of reckoning.\" <br>He used to say: <br>\"I love death, so that I may meet Allah. I <br>love destitutioq, so that I be meek. I love sickness, so <br>that I be pardoned my sins.\" <br>In this story, we find a person travelling all the way <br>from Madinah to Damascus for the sake of one Hadith. This <br>was not at all hard for those people. Hadhrat Sha'abi (Kah- <br>matullahi alaih) is a famous Muhaddith of Koofa. He once <br>narrated a Hadith to one of his students and said: <br>\"You are listening to this Hadith while sitting in your <br>home town. People had to travel all their way to Madi- <br>nah for even less important things, because Madinah <br>was the only of seat learning in those days.\" <br>, Saeed ibnul Musayyab (Rahmatullahi alaihf is a famous <br>Tabi'ee. He says: <br><br>\"For each Hadith that I have learnt, I had to travel on <br>foot for days and nights together.\" <br>Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullahi alaih) was born in Shawwal <br>194 A.H. He started learning Hadith in 205 A.H. i.e., when <br>he was only eleven. He had memorised all the books writ- <br>ten by Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullahi alaih) while <br>he was in his early teens. After collecting Ahadith from all <br>the learned men of his own locality, he set out in 216 A.H. <br>in search of further knowledge. His father died and he <br>could not leave his widowed mother alone. He therefore <br>took her with him on his long and strenuous journey to <br>Balkh, Baghdad, Mecca, Basra, Koofah, Asqalan, Hims and <br>Damascus. He collected all the available Ahadith from <br>these seats of learning. He was accepted as an expert in <br>Hadith, while he had not a single hair on his chin. He <br>writes: <br>I was eighteen when I compiled the Fatwah of the Sa- <br>habah and Tabi'ees.\" <br>Hashad (Rahmatullahi alaihe) and one of his companions <br>say:-<br>\"Bukhari and we two used to go together to the same <br>teacher. We noted down all the Ahadith that we learnt, <br>but he wrote nothing. After many days we said to him, <br>'Bukhari, you are wasting your time.' He kept quiet. <br>When we admonished him again and again, he said, <br>'You are now annoying me too much. Bring your <br>notes.' We brought our notes, which covered about <br>15,000Ahadith. He, to our utter amazement, recited all <br>those Ahadith by heart.\" <br>10. \t Hadhrat Ibn Abbas's (Radhiyallaho anho) Thirst For <br>Knowledge. <br>Hadhrat AbdulIah bin Abbas (~adhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"After the passing away of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), I said to an Ansari friend of mine. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is not now <br>with us. But a large number of Sahabah are still among <br>us. Let us go to them and get knowledge of the Islamic <br>practices\". He said. 'Who is going to approach you for <br>learning a regulation in the presence of these eminent <br>Sahabah?' I was not discouraged. I kept up my quest <br>for knowledge and approached every person who was <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>supposed to have heard something from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I managed to gather sub- <br>stantial information from the Ansar. If on my visit to <br>someone of the Sahabah, Ifound him asleep, I spread <br>my shawl at the gate and sat waiting. Sometimes my <br>face and body would get covered with dust, but I kept <br>sitting till they woke and I was able to contact them. <br>Some of them said: 'Abdullah you are the cousin of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); you could have <br>sent for us. Why did you take the trouble of coming to <br>our places?' I said to them: 'I must come to you, for I <br>am a student and you are my teachers.' Some people <br>for whom I had waited said: 'Since when have you <br>been waiting for us?' I informed them that I had been <br>sitting there for a pretty long time. They said: 'What a <br>pity! You could have awakened us from our sleep.' I <br>said:\"I did not like to disturb you for my own sake.' I <br>thus carried on my pursuits, till there came a time <br>when people began to flock to me for learning. My <br>Ansari friend realised this at that time and remarked. <br>'This boy has surely proved himself more sensible than <br>us.\" <br>It was \\this devotion to knowledge, which caused <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) to be <br>known as ~ i b r - u l - ~ m m a t  <br>(the most learned man of Islam) <br>and Bahrul Ulum (ocean of knowledge) in his time. At the <br>time of his death, he was in Taif. Hadhrat Muhammad bin <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) led the funeral service and said: <br>\"Today we have lost our godly leader.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bih Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah~bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is noted for <br>his knowledge of the occasions when various verses of <br>the Qur'an were revealed.\" <br>According to Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) Hadhrat <br>Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the most eminent <br>Ulama of Islam. This is all due to his hard labour in acquir-<br>ing knowledge. Had he considered himself a member of the <br>Prophet's family (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and as such <br>4 \tdemanded respect from the people instead of going to them <br>for knowledge, he could not have attained this position. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br><br>~ h .  \t<br>VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"Be most humble and respectful to persons from <br>whom you receive knowledge.\" <br>Mujahid says: \"A proud or shy student cannot gain much.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I am a slave to the person who has taught me even a <br>single word. He may sell me or set me free.\" <br>Hadhrat Yahya bin Kathir (Rahmalullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Knowledge and easy living cannot go hand in hand.\" <br>Hadhrat Imam Shaf'i (Rahmatullah aiaih) says: <br>\"A student who learns half-heartedly and ungratefully <br>can never succeed. A student who is humble and hard- <br>living often reaches his goal.\" <br>Mughirah says: \t \"We feared our teachor Hadhrat Ibrahim <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) more than even the <br>kings of our times.\" <br>Hadhrat Bukhari (Rahmatullah alaih) writes about Yahya <br>bin Ma'een, the famous Mohaddith: <br>\"I have never seen a person more respectful to the Muhad- <br>dithin than Yahya.\" <br>Imam Abu Yusuf (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I \t have heard from eminent people that a student who <br>does not respect his teacher is never successful.\" <br>This story shows that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) was very humble and respectful to <br>those from whom he learnt Islam. It also shows his devo- <br>tion to knowledge. He did not mind any amount of labour <br>or inconvenience in going to persons who had some knowl- <br>edge of Hadith. In fact, nothing can be achieved without in- <br>convenience. As the Arabic proverb goes <br>\"A person who wishes to excel1 others must burn the <br>midnight oil.\" <br>It is said about Hadhrat Harith bin Yazid, Hadhrat Ibn Shu- <br>brumah, Hadhrat Qa'qaa, and Hadhrat Mughirah (Rahma- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>tullahi alaihim) that they held discussions over religious <br>matters among themselves after Isha and would not dis- <br>perse before Azaan of Fajr. Hadhrat Laith bin Sa'eed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Zilhri (Rahmatullah alaih) sat after Isha with <br>Wudhu and continued his discussion on Hadith till it <br>was Fajr.\" <br>Darawardi says: <br>\"I saw Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik in the <br>Prophet's musjid after Isha, discussing some religious <br>point very calmly and without offending each other. <br>They dispersed only after performing Fajr Salaat.\" <br>Ibn Furat Baghdadi (Rahmatullah a1aih)-a <br>Milhaddith, <br>left on his death, eighteen boxes full of books. Most of <br>these books were written in his own hand. He is famous <br>among Muhaddithin for his authentic and systematic <br>record. <br>Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullah alaih) is another famous Mu- <br>haddith. He was brought up as an orphan, as he lost his <br>father when he was only three. He was so studious that he <br>would not leave his house except for Jum'uah prayer. He <br>once declared from the pulpit, pointing to his fingers: <br>\"With these fingers I have written or copied no less <br>than two thousand books.\" <br>He was himself the author of more than two hundred and <br>fifty books. It is said that he never remained idle. He used <br>to write four parts of a book daily. His lessorls were so pop- <br>ular that as many as 400000 students at a time listened to <br>him. The kings, their ministers and chiefs would also <br>attend his lectures. He himself says: <br>\"As many as 100000 disciples have pledged devotion <br>to me, and not less than 20000 disbelievers have ac- <br>cepted Islam at my hands.\" <br>He also had to suffer much at the hands of Shiahs, who <br>were in power those days. While mending his reed pen, he <br>preserved the chips, and at the time of his death expressed <br>I<br>the desire that those chips be used for warming the water <br>for washing his dead body. It is said that not only the pre- <br>served stock was sufficient for warming water, but a part <br>was still left unused. <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>153 8 ,<br>\"0s <br>Yahya bin Ma'een (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous shaikh -84 <br>of Ahadith. He says: <br>wSW <br>\"I have written one million Ahadith with my own <br>hand\". <br>Ibn Jarir Tabari (Rahmatullah alaih) is a historian of great <br>fame. He is an authority on the history of the Sahabah and <br>Tabien. For forty years, he wrote 80 pages daily. After his <br>death, his output in written work (since his maturity) was <br>calculated to come to 28 pages daily. The book on history <br>written by him which is generally available is very famous <br>and popular. When he planned to write this book, he said <br>to the people round him: <br>\"You will be pleased to learn that <br>intend writing a book on world history. <br>They inquired- <br>\"How big will that book be?\" <br>He said: <br>\"About 30 000 leaves.\" <br>They remarked: \"Who will live to finish this book?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon. <br>People have become so unaspiring.\" <br>He then decided to condense the material, which still cov- <br>ered 6 000 pages. The same story is reported about his book <br>on the meaning and commentary of the Qu'ran. This is also <br>a very famous and popular book. <br>Daaraqutni (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous writer on <br>Hadith. He travelled to Baghdad, Basrah, Koofah, Wasit, <br>Egypt and Syria for learning Hadith. Once he was attending <br>the class of his teacher. During the teacher's lecture he was <br>once seen copying from a certain book. One of the fellow <br>students admonished him saying: <br>\"How can you listen to the Shaikh while doing that <br>work?\" <br>IIe said: \"There is a difference in my listening and yours. <br>Tell me how many Hadiths has the Shaikh recited so <br>far?\" <br>The student began to think. Daaraqutni (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>said: <br>\"Now let me tell you. The Shaikh has so far recited <br>eighteen Hadiths and these are . . .\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He then repeated all the eighteen Ahadiths that the Shaikh <br>had recited in the same order, quoting the chain of narra- <br>tion in each case. <br>Hafiz Athram (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith. He <br>had a wonderful capacity for memorising Ahadith. Once he <br>was in Mecca for Hajj. Two reputed Shaikhs from Khurasan <br>were holding their lectures on Hadith in the Haram separa- <br>tely, and a large number of people were listening to each <br>Shaikh. He sat between the two groups and noted down the <br>lectures of both the Shaikhs at one and the same time. <br>Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mo- <br>haddith of great fame. His labours and efforts in collecting <br>Hadiths are known to everybody. He says: <br>\"I have learnt Hadith from four thousand teachers.\" <br>Ali bin Hasan (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>':It was a very cold night when I and Ibn Mubarak step- <br>ped out from the musjid after lsha. We continued dis- <br>cussion on a Hadith while standing there, till we heard <br>the Azaan for Fajr.\" <br>Humaidi (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith, who has <br>combined Bukhari and Muslim in one compilation. It is <br>said that he wrote throughout the night. When it was very <br>hot, he would write while sitting in a tub of water. He also <br>wrote poetry. The following verses have been written by <br>him:-<br>Mixing with people does not benefit <br>Beyond waste of time in gossip; <br>Don't go to the people, except <br>For acquiring knowledge and piety <br>Imam Tabrani (Rahmatullah alaih) is a reputed Muhad- <br>L<br>dith and author of numerous books. Somebody inquired: <br>, <br>\"How could you write so many books, Shaikh?\" <br>He replied: \"I have been on my mat for thirty years.\" <br><br>-<br>4.r <br>0 %<br>E a<br>Abul Abbas Shirazi (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>-cC, <br>srij<br>\"I have learnt 300000 Ahadith from Tabrani.\" <br>m <br>Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah alaih) laboured very <br>hard in going deep into those Ahadiths which contradicted <br>some others. Koofah was the centre of Islamic learning in <br>those days. He had collected Hadith from all the Muhaddi- <br>thin of that place. Whenever a Muhaddith from outside <br>came to Koofah, he sent his students to him to ascertain if <br>he knew any such Hadith that was not known to him. The <br>Imam had established a circle where scholars of Hadith, <br>Fiqah, and Philology gathered together. They had dis-<br>cussions on regulations about Islamic practices. Sometimes <br>the discussions continued for one month before a point <br>was agreed upon, and written in the book of regulations for <br>the people of his school of thought. <br>Imam Tirmizi (Rahmatullah alaih) is known to one and <br>all. He was unique in his capacity for memorising and re- <br>taining Ahadith. His memory was marvellous. Some Mu- <br>haddithin once tested his memory. They recited before him <br>forty-one Hadiths. Imam Tirmizi (Kadmatullah alaih) im- <br>mediately repeated all of them. He himself writes: <br>\"On my way to Mecca, I copied two parts from the col- <br>lections of Hadith by a Shaikh. I happened to come <br>across that Shaikh personally. I said to him, 'I have <br>copied two parts of your collections. I wish to compare <br>those Hadiths by listening to them directly from you.' <br>The Shaikh agreed. While going to his place I, by rnis.% <br>take, took a blank book instead of the note book in <br>which I had copied the Hadiths. The Shaikh started re- <br>citing the Hadiths, while I held the blank book in my <br>hand. When he noticed it, he was very angry with me. <br>I explained to him how that had happened, and said, <br>'Shaikh, your time is not wasted. I remember every- <br>thing that you have said.' He did not believe me and <br>asked me to repeat all that he had recited. I repeated <br>all the Ahadith. He thought I had memorised them <br>before I came to him. I said, 'You may recite some <br>other Hadiths.' He recited forty new Hadiths. I re-<br>peated all of them without any error.\" <br>It is very difficult to work and labour as hard as these <br>Muhaddithin did in collecting, memorising and propagat- <br>ing Hadith. It is difficult even to cover all such stories. Qar- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>ramah (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith who is not very <br>famous. One of his students, Daud, says: <br>\"People speak about the memory of Abu Hatim (Rah- <br>matullah alaih). I have never seen a person with better <br>memory than Qartamah. Once he said to me, \"Pick any <br>of the books from my library. I shall recite it from my <br>memory.\" I picked up 'Kitabul-Ashribah.' He recited <br>the whole book in the reverse order i.e.. reading from <br>the end to the beginning of each chapter.\" <br>Abu Zur'ah (Rahmatullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Ahmad bin Hambal (Rahmatullah alaih) re-<br>membered one million Ahadith by heart. I have col- <br>lected 100 000 Ahadith and I know 30 000 of them by <br>heart.\" <br>Khafaf (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"Ishaq (Rahmatulla alaih) once dictated to us 11000 <br>Ahadith from his memory. He then repeated all of <br>them in the same order, with no error at all.\" <br>Abu Sa'd Isbahani, (Rahmatullah alaih) when he was <br>only sixteen, left from Baghdad to learn Hadith from Abu <br>Nasr (Rahmatullah alaih). He heard about his death on the <br>way. He cried bitterly like a child, and would say: <br>\"How shall I know the chain of narrators of his Ha- <br>diths?\" <br>Such crying is not possible without love and devotion. He <br>knew the 'Muslim' collection of Ahadith by heart and <br>taught the book to histpuplis from memory. <br>Abu Umar Dharir (Rahmatullah alaih) was blind by <br>birth, but is counted among the Huffaaz of Hadith. He was <br>an expert in History, Fiqah, L,aw of inheritance and math- <br>ematics. <br>Abul Husain Isfahani (Rahmatullah alaih) remembered <br>the Bukhari and Muslim compilations both by heart. Buk- <br>hari was so deeply fixed in his memory that he would give <br>the chain of narrators for any text or vice versa. <br>Shaikh Taqi-ud-Din Ba'albakki (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>memorised the 'Muslim' in four months. He was also Hafiz <br>of Hadith common in Muslim's and Bukhari's compila- <br>tions. He was a saint, and many miracles are attributed to <br><br>him. He had also memorised the Qur'an. It is said that <br>Soorah Al-An'aam was memorised by him in one day. <br>Ibnus-Sunni (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous pupil of <br>Imam Nasai (Kahmatullah alaih). He was writing Hadith <br>even upto the last moments of his life. His son says: <br>\"My father was writing Hadith when he put aside the <br>pen, raised his hands in prayer and breathed his last.\" <br>Allamah Saaji (Kahmatullah alaih) mastered Fiqah in <br>his teens. Then he began to acquire knowledge about <br>Iiadith. Ile stayed in Herat for ten years and wrote the <br>whole of 'Tirmizi' six times during that stay. His teacher <br>Ibn Mandah (Rahmatullah alaih) died while teaching him <br>'Gharaib Sho'bah' after Isha. <br>Abu-Umar Khafaf (Rahmatullah alaih) remembered <br>100 000 hadiths by heart. More than 100 000 persons at- <br>tended the lectures of Asim bin Ali (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>(Shaikh of Imam Bukhari) when he was in Baghdad. One <br>day, an audience of 120 000 was estimated during his lec- <br>ture. The words uttered by hinl were relayed a number of <br>times, before these could be heard by all the people. The <br>words \"Al-Laith (Rahmatullah alaih) reported to me,\" ut- <br>tered by him, once had to be relayed fourteen times. <br>Abu Muslim Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) on reaching <br>Baghdad took his class to a big ground. Seven hucdred <br>men were relaying his lecture. 40 000 ink-pots, used for <br>taking down his lecture, were counted in one lecture. <br>There were many more who simply listened. In the lectures <br>by Faryabi (Rdhmatullah alaih) there used to be 316 per- <br>sons who would relay his words to enable people to write <br>these down. It was this labour and devotion which has <br>caused the sacred knowledge to live upto our time. <br>Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I cornpiled my collection of 7 275 Ahadith by selec- <br>tion from 600 000. I have been saying Salaat of 2 ra-<br>kaats before writing each Hadith\".' <br>When Imaam Bukhari (Kahmatullah alaih) came to Bagh- <br>dad, the Muhaddithin tested his knowledge. Ten persons <br>were nominated for the test. Each of these persons selected <br>ten Ahadith of his choice and, after making some changes <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>in the wording, recited each Hadith before Imam Bukhari <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). On each recital, he would say: <br>\"1 do not know such Hadith.\" <br>When all had finished, he addressed each man saying: <br>\"Brother, the first Hadith you recited as such (reciting <br>as the man had done), but actually it is such (reciting <br>the correct wording) . . .and so on.\" <br>He repeated all the hundred Ahadith first in the form in <br>which those men had recited, and again in the correct form <br>in that very order. <br>Imam Muslim (Rahmatullah alaih) started learning <br>Hadith when he was fourteen, and remained engaged in <br>that till his death. He says: <br>\"I have compiled my book of <br>from 300 000 Ahadith.\" <br>12 000 after selecting <br>Abu Daud (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I had collected 500 000 Ahadith, but I selected only <br>4 800 for inclusion in my book.\" <br>Yusuf Muzi (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous Muhadith. <br>He is an Imam in the science of Asmaa-ur Rijaal (classifica- <br>tion of reporting persons). After learning Fiqh and Hadith <br>from the teachers in his own town he went to Mecca, Madi- <br>nah, Halb, Hamat Ba'albak etc, in search of further knowl- <br>edge. He is the writer of many books. 'Tahzib-ul-Kamal' is <br>in 200 parts and 'Kitab-ul-Atraaf' has more than 80 parts. <br>He often kept quiet and spoke very little. Most of the time, <br>he was engaged intreading or writing. He suffered at the <br>hands of his enemies, who were jealous of him, but he <br>never retaliated. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the stories of other <br>illustrious people about their service to knowledge. The de- <br>tails of their toils cannot be covered even in several vol- <br>umes. What has been written above is only meant to give a <br>few glimpses of the pains that our elders in Islam have <br>taken in the development of knowledge about Hadith and <br>leaving it to us in such an accomplished form. Let those <br>people who profess to seek knowledge see for themselves <br>what sacrifices they are really making in this field: It is <br>futile to hope that the knowledge about the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), which has thus reached us, will be <br><br> <br>spread and brought into practice while we remain absorbed <br>in our luxuries, comforts, pleasures and other worldly en- <br>gagements. <br>.g %P <br>cn~<br>r<br>n<br> <br><br>CHAPTER IX <br>PLEASING THE PROPHET <br>(SALLALLAHO ALAIHE WASALLAM) <br>As we have already seen from the stories in previous <br>chapters, obedience to Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was the guiding factor in the Sahabah's <br>life. Stories given exclusively in this chapter are to enable <br>us to examine our way of living and see how far we are pre- <br>pared to please Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alihe wa- <br>sallam), in order to deserve the necessary progress and <br>other blessings, which the Sahabah received. If we are desi- <br>rous of similar results, we shall have to live the way they <br>lived. <br>1. \t Hadhrat Ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) Burns His <br>Sheet. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr ibnul Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"Once we were accompanying the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on a journey. I went to see him and I <br>was wearing a saffron coloured sheet. He said to me, <br>'What is this that you are wearing?' I felt that he did <br>not like my wearing a dress of that colour. When I <br>reached home, ,Ifound a fire burning in the hearth. I <br>threw my garment into the fire. The next day when I <br>went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he <br>inquired, 'Where is that sheet?' I told him what I had <br>done with it. He remarked, \"You could have given it to <br>one of the ladies in your house, women are permitted <br>to wear clothes of that colour.\" <br>In fact, Abdullah was so much perturbed at the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) displeasure that he <br>did not hesitate to avail of the first opportunity of doing <br>away with the sheet that caused the displeasure. He did not <br>even think of making any other use of that garment. If we <br>had been in his place, we would have thought of some <br>excuse or the other for keeping it, or at least finding some <br>other use for it. <br><br>Ch. IX: Pleasing the Prophet <br>2. \t<br>An Ansari razes a building to the ground. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once 8 <br>passing through a street of Madinah when he saw a build- <br>ine with a dome. He inauired of the comoanions, \"What is <br>thrs?\" They informed him that it was a n'ew building built <br>by one of the Ansar. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ramained silent. At some other time, the Ansari who <br>had built that house came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and greeted him with 'Assalamo alaikum'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) turned his face from <br>him. He repeated the greetings, but the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) again gave him the cold shoulder. He was <br>very much shocked to notice the Prophet's aversion for <br>him. When he investigated, he was given the account of the <br>Prophet's inquring about his new building. He immediately <br>went and razed the new building to the ground, and'did <br>not even inform the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>about his action. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>happened to pass that way again. He inquired: <br>\"Where is that building with a dome that I saw at this <br>spot last time?\" <br>The Sahabah informed him of Ansari's razing it to the <br>ground, as it had been the likelv cause of the Prophet's dis- <br>pleasure. He remarked. <br>\"Every new structure is a sinful burden for its owner, <br>except that which is absolutely essdntial.\" <br>This is a matter of love and devotion. The Sahabah <br>could not bear the displeasure of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and, no sooner did they smell such a <br>thing, than they removed the cause thereof at all costs. <br>Again the person does not even inform the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) of his drastic action in removing the <br>cause of his displeasure, till he himself happened to notice <br>it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had a special <br>aversion for the people wasting their monev on buildings. <br>His own house was a temporary structure of date palm, <br>with mats serving the purpose of walls to secure privacy. <br>Once, during his absence from Madinah, Ummul Mp'minin <br>Umme Salma (Radhiallaho anha) who had some money in <br>hand, erected walls of unbaked bricks for her house. When <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned from his <br>journey, he asked her: <br>\"Why did you do this?\" <br>She replied: \"0,Prophet of Allah. This is only to have <br>better privacy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The worst use of money is to spend it in raising up <br>buildings.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"I and my mother were once repairing a wall of our <br>house. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) hap- <br>pened to see us working and remarked: 'Your own fall <br>(death) is more at hand than the fall of this wall.\" <br>3. \t<br>Sahabah's Discard of Red Sheets of Saddle Cloth. <br>Hadhrat Rafe' (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) on a journey. The sheets that we had spread on <br>our camels were decorated with red thread work on <br>the borders. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, 'I notice that the red colour has begun to catch <br>your fancy.' We stood up and dispersed in confusion at <br>this rebuke; so much so that our camels seeing our b,e- <br>wilderment began to run about. We immediately re- <br>moved the sheetsfrom their backs.\" <br>We are surprised on hearing such stories about Saha- <br>bah, as we are living in a different atmosphere with quite a <br>different frame of mind. When the Truce of Hudeybiyah <br>was being negotiated, Urwah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) an envoy of Qureysh, had an opportunity of studying <br>very carefully the behaviour of Sahabah. When he returned <br>to his people, he said to them: <br>\"I have been to the courts of great kings and monarchs <br>as an envoy. I have met the Emperors of Persia, Rome <br>and Abyssinia. Nowhere have I seen people around a <br>sovereign so respectful to him as I saw the companions <br>of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). When he <br>spits, his sputum is not allowed to fall on the ground. <br><br>It is taken by somebody in his hands to anoint his face <br>and body therewith. When he issues some order, e1 ery <br>person hastens to carry it out. When he makes Wu ihu, <br>his companions race one with another to snatch the <br>water trickling down from his limbs, in such a way <br>that an observer would think they are going to fight <br>over that water. When he speaks, everybody is silent as <br>if they were dumb. Nobody raises his eyes to look at <br>him, out of respect for him.\" <br>4. \t Hadhrat Waa'il (Radhiyallaho anho) Has His Hair <br>Cut. <br>Hadhrat Waa'il bin Hajar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once visited the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when the hair on my head was long. While I was <br>sitting with him, he uttered the words. 'Zubab, Zubab' <br>(Meaning something evil or ominous). I though he was <br>referring to my hair. I returned home and had my hair <br>cut. Next day when I again went to him, he said, 'I <br>never referred to your hair when I uttered those words <br>yesterday. Any how, it is good that you had your hair <br>cut.\" <br>This shows the frame of mind of those people. They <br>tolerated no delay in acting upon the wishes of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), whether they understood it <br>rightly or wrongly. They never thought it necessary to fur- <br>ther inquire or clarify. <br>In the early years, talking in Salaat was permissible. <br>Once Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallake-anho) <br>visited the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while he <br>was saying his Salaat. He greated him with \"Assallamo'a- <br>laikum\" but received no reply, as to talk in Salaat had <br>meanwhile been forbidden. He says: <br>\"For receiving no reply, all sorts of explanations began <br>to haunt my mind. I thoLdht perhaps he is displeased <br>with me, or he is angry with me on such and such ac- <br>count, and so on.' At last when the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) finished his Salaat and informed me <br>that Allah had forbidden talking in Salaat I heaved a <br>sigh of relief.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up <br>what is not liked bythe Prophet: <br>Hadhrat Suhdil bin Hanzalah CRadhiyallaho anho) was <br>living a life of seclusion in Damascus. He did not mix with <br>people, nor did he go anywhere. He was either busy in <br>Salaat or in Zikr throughout the day. While going to <br>musjid, he would pass by Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), one of the eminent Sahabah. Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) would say to him: <br>\"0,Suhail! Let us hear some good words from you. We <br>shalI'gain much, though you will lose nothing.\" <br>Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) would then relate <br>something that he had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), or some event that he had seen in his life <br>time. Once on Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>request as usual, he said: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made a <br>mention of Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho<br>anho) and said, \"He is a good man except for two <br>habits, viz, he keeps the hair of his head too long and <br>he allows his izaar to go below his ankles. When Khu- <br>raim leal'nt this, he immediately cut the hair up to his <br>ears and began to keep his izaar up to the middle of the <br>calf of his leg.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up <br>speaking with his son. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once <br>said: <br>\"I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'Allow your women to go to the musjid.\" <br>One of his sons remarked: <br>\"We cannot allow our women to go to the musjid, as <br>this may lead to corruption later on.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn-Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) became very angry <br>and rebuked his son, saying: <br>\"When I tell you that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has allowed our women folk to go to musjid, <br>how dare you say that you cannot allow them.\" <br><br>He then, refused to speak to him throughout his.life. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho's) son obviously <br>had no intention of disobeying the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He feared corruption in allowing the <br>women-folk of that time to go to the musjid. For the same <br>reason, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"If the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had seen <br>the women of our time, he would have stopped them <br>from going to the musjid.\" <br>Now, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said this not <br>very long after the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho hlaihe <br>wasallam). Notwithstanding all this, Hadhrat Ibn Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his son refusing to <br>do something which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had desired to be done, and he gave up talking to him <br>for the rest of his life. The Sahabah sometimes found them- <br>selves faced with a dilemma regarding the women visiting <br>the musjid. On the one hand, there was the explicit desire <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in favour of <br>permitting them to go to the musjid, and on the other there <br>was the possibility of looseness in society (the signs of <br>which were becoming visible) that demanded an immedi- <br>ate check on this permission. Hadhrat 'Atikah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) the wife of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>went to musjid regularly but Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) did <br>not like it. Somebody told her that Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) did not like her going to the musjid. She <br>said: <br>\"Why does he not prevent me from doing it then?\" <br>After the death of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Hadhrat 'Atikah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Hadh- <br>rat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). He also did not like her <br>going to musjid, but could not check her for the above ob- <br>vious reason. Once he sat in her way to musjid and, as she <br>passed by him, he teased her. In the dark, she could not <br>make out who it was. After this incident, she stopped going <br>to musjid. When Zubair inquired of her: <br>\"Why do not you go to the musjid now?\" <br>She replied: \"Times have changed.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) Replies to a <br>Question. <br>Somebody said to Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Allah has said in the Qur'arl something about Salaat <br>in peace and Salaat in fear. but He has not said any- <br>thing about Salaat during a journey.\" <br>He replied: \"0,my nephew! Allah sent Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as his Apostle to us, when we <br>were ignorant and knew nothing. We must do what we <br>have seen him doing.\" <br>This shows that it is not necessary that each and every <br>regulation should be explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. <br>The acts of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is a <br>very good guide for our practice. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been given the Qur'an and also other com- <br>mandments. Beware of the time, which is coming <br>shortly, when carefree people sitting on their couches <br>will say. 'Stick to the Qur'an only. Carry out only the <br>commandments contained therein.' \" <br>Such corrup!ted views are generally inspired by arrogance <br>due to wealth, and perhaps that is why the word \"carefree\" <br>is used for such people. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Mughaffal (Radhiyallaho anho) Discon- <br>tinues Relations With His Nephew. <br>A young nephe& of Hadhrat Abdullah-bin-Mughaffal <br>(Radhiyallaho allaho anho) was playing 'Khazaf'. He said to <br>him: <br>\"0nephew! Stop doing that. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has prohibited this play. It can <br>neither shoot a bird nor harm an enemy it is likely to <br>injure somebody's eye or tooth. <br>The boy stopped playing but, after some time when he <br>thought that his uncle was not watching him, he started <br>doing it again Hadhrat Ibne-Mughaffal (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was very angry and said: <br>\"How dare you do a thing after knowing that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbidden it? <br><br>By Allah! I will never speak to you again. 1 will never <br>visit you when you are sick, nor join your funeral if <br>you die during my life time.\" <br>'Khazaf' is a game in which a pebble is placed on the <br>thumb and then thrown with the force of other fingers. <br>Children are fond of playing such games. Hadhrat Ibn Mug- <br>haffal [Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his nephew's <br>ignoring the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Do we not know the instructions of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) about many things we are wont to <br>do from morning till evening? How much regard do we <br>have in our hearts for his verdict? Let everybody ponder <br>over it himself and answer. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) Gives up <br>Begging. . <br>Hadhrat Hakim bin Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and begged him <br>for help. He gave him something. Next time he came and <br>asked for something. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) gave him something this time also. When he came to <br>beg the third time, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after giving him something, said: <br>\"Hakim! Money has a deceptive appearance. It appears <br>to be very sweet (but it is really not so). It is a blessing <br>when earned with contentment of heart, but there is no <br>satisfaction in it when it is got with greed.\" <br>Hakim said: \t \"0,Prophet of Allah, I will not bother any- <br>body after this.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in the time of <br>his Khilafat offered to help Hakim from Baitul Mal, but he <br>refused. Again Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) as Amir-ul-Mo- <br>minin requested Hakim many times to accept something <br>from him, but he did not agree. <br>Our greed and avarice know no bounds; this is why we <br>find no blessings in what we earn. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) Goes For <br>Spying. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) narattes: <br>\"In the war of the Trench, we were facing a very big <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>army of the enemy, comprising of non-believers from <br>Mecca and other such groups. At the same time, the <br>Jews of Banu Quraizah in Madinah were preparing to <br>stab us in the back, and we apprehended their plun- <br>dering our houses and families, for all of us were out- <br>side defending Madinah against the invaders. The <br>Munafiqin started asking permission from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to go back to Madinah, on <br>the pretext of their homes being unattended and open <br>to the enemy. He permitted every one of them. During <br>those days of trial, one night it was unusually very <br>dark and windy, It was so dark that one could not see <br>one's own hand, and the wind was blowing wildly. <br>The Munafiqin were returning to their homes. We, <br>three hundred strong, were sticking to our posts. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) approached every <br>one and made enquiries about him. I had no arms to <br>defend myself, nor clothes to resist the cold. I had only <br>one small sheet, which belonged to my wife and was <br>lent to me. I wrapped it round my loins and sat with <br>my knees clinging to the ground. When the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passed by me, he said, <br>'Who are you? I said, 'Huzaifah!' I could not stand up <br>due to severe cold and I clung to the ground more <br>tightly with shame. He said, 'Huzaifah, stand up and <br>go to the enemy camp and bring us their news.' Of all <br>the Sahabah, I was the most ill-equipped, both against <br>the enemy and against the cold that night, but as soon <br>as I got the order I stood up and left for the enemy <br>camp. As I was going, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prayedffor me saying, '0 Allah! Protect him <br>from all directions.' Immediately after his prayer, I was <br>completely relieved of my fear and cold. I felt as if I <br>were walking in a warm and peaceful atmosphere. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) warned me thus, <br>'Return immediately after observing what they are <br>doing. Do not take any other step.' When I reached the <br>enemy camp, I found a fire burning and people sitting <br>round it. Each person warmed his hands before the fire <br>and then rubbed them over his abdomen. The shouts of <br>retreat were heard from all directions. Every one was <br>shouting to the people of his clan to pack up and go <br>back. The wind was causing the stones to fly and strike <br>against their tents. The guy ropes of the tents were <br>breaking and the animals were dying. I found Abu <br><br>Ch. IX: Pleasing the Prophet <br>S= <br>CI a <br>Sufyan, the Commander-in-Chief of the enemy forces, <br>;% <br>sitting near the fire warming himself. I thought of fin- 33 <br>m<br>ishing him off. I had actually taken out an arrow from <br>my quiver and placed it in my bow, when I remem-<br>bered the directive of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I put the arrow back into the quiver. While <br>I was among them, they seemed to become aware of <br>my presence. They shouted, 'There is a spy among us. <br>Every one of us should catch the hand of the person <br>next to him I immediately caught the hand of a person <br>and shouted, 'Who are you? 'He said, 'Subhanallah! <br>you do not know me. I am so and so. 'I then returned <br>to my camp. While I was on my way back, I met <br>twenty horsemen with turbans on their heads. They <br>said to me, 'Tell your master that Allah has dealt with <br>his enemy and that he has nothing to worry about <br>now.' Whgn I reached my camp, I found the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying his Salaat with a <br>small shawl around him. Whenever he faced a diffi- <br>~ ~ l l t y .<br>he immediately turned towards Salaat. When he <br>had finished, I reported to him what I had seen in the <br>enemy camp. When I narrated how I escaped their <br>'search for the spy', I could see his beautiful teeth shin- <br>ing. He then asked me to lie down near his feet and put <br>a corner of his shawl over my body. I lay down and <br>pressed my breast against the soles of his feet.\" <br>Look at their spirit of carrying out the orders of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) under very adverse <br>and trying conditions. May Allah favour us with such spirit <br>of obedience, even though we do not deserve it. Aameen! <br><br>I <br>! <br>CHAPTER-X <br>THE WOMEN'S COURAGE AND SPIRIT OF ISLAM <br>The lap of the mother is admitted to be the best field of <br>instruction. Mothers imbued with the religious spirit are <br>more likely to bring up children who will have similar ap- <br>titudes. Alas! our children are brought up in surroundings <br>that draw them away from Islam or at least make them in- <br>different to the duties they owe therein; the results are ob- <br>vious. <br>1. \t Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Tasbih: <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to one of <br>his pupils: <br>\"Shall I tell you the story of Hadhrat Fatimah (Rad- <br>hiyaliaho anha), the dearest and the most loved daugh- <br>ter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When the pupil replied in the affirmative, he said: <br>\"Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) used to grind <br>the grain herself, which caused corns on her hands. <br>She carried water for the house in a leather bag, which <br>left a mark on her breast. She cleaned the house her- <br>self, which made her clothes dirty. Once some war- <br>captives were brought to Madinah. I said to her, 'Go to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and request <br>him for an assistant to help you in your house-work.' <br>She went to him, but found many people round him. <br>As she was very modest, she could not be bold enough <br>to request the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in <br>the presence of other people. Next day the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) came to our house and <br>said, \"Fatimah! what made~you come to me yester- <br>day?'' She felt shy and kept quiet. I said, \"0,Prophet <br>of Allah! Fatimah has developed callusses on both her <br>hands and breast, on account of grinding and carrying <br>water. She is constantly busy in cleaning the house <br>and in other domestic jobs, causing her clothes to <br>remain dirty. I informed her about the captives and ad- <br>vised her to go to you and make a request for a ser- <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>171 3 A <br>Ud0sa <br>YI 4<br>vant.' It has also been reported that Hadhrat Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) made a request, 'I and Ali own 31 <br>only one bedding and that also is a skin of a goat. We <br>use it in the morning to put the feed of the camel.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Fatimah! <br>Be patient. The Prophet Moses (Alayhis Salam) and his <br>wife owned only one bedding, which was the cloak of <br>Moses. Fear Allah; acquire Taqwa and keep doing your <br>service to Allah and attend to your domestic jobs. <br>When you go to bed, recite Subhanallah 33 times, Al- <br>hamdulillah 33 times and Allahoakbar 34 times. You <br>will find this more helpful than an assistant.' Hadhrat <br>Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) remarked, 'I am happy <br>with what Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) would be pleased with.\" <br>Look! This is the life of the Prophet's dear daughter. In <br>moderately rich families of our times, the ladies think it <br>below their dignity to attend to domestic work. They need <br>assistance in each and every thing, even in their bathroom! <br>What a difference! <br>In this Hadith, the prescribed Zikr is before sleep. In <br>other Ahadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have advised Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) to recite after every Salaat. Subhanallah 33 times. Al- <br>hamdulillah 33 times, Allahoakbar 33 times and Lailaha-il- <br>lallaho wahdahu-lasharikalahu-lahulmulkuwalahulhamdu-<br>wahuwa-ala-kulli-sha-in-Qadir,<br>once, <br>2, \t<br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending In <br>the Path of Allah. <br>Once Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) received a gift of two <br>bags containing one lakh (100,000)Dirhams. She started <br>distributing these among the poor, till by the evening not a <br>single dirham was left with her. She was fasting that day. <br>Her maid servant brought her a loaf of bread and a little <br>olive oil for Iftar, and remarked, \"I wish we had kept one <br>dirham for ourselves to get some meat for Iftaar.\" Aishah <br>said: <br>\"Do not be sorry now. If you had told me at that time I <br>would have perhaps spared one dirham.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Gifts of this nature were often received by Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) from Amir Muawiah, Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma) and others. <br>for that was the time of ease and plenty for the Muslims as <br>territory after territory fell into their hands. In spite of this <br>abundance, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) led a life <br>of abstention. Look! She distributes 100 000 dirhams to the <br>poor, but she does not remember to get some meat for her <br>own Iftar. In our own atmosphere today, such stories seem <br>to be impossible but, to the people who have understood <br>the Sahabah's frame of mind, hundreds of such incidents <br>are quite credible. There are many stories of this nature re- <br>ported about Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha). Once she was <br>fasting and had nothing for her Iftar except one piece of <br>bread. A poor man came and begged for some food. She <br>asked her maid to give him that piece of bread. The maid <br>said: <br>\"If I give him the piece of bread, there will be nothing <br>left for your Iftar\". <br>She said: \"Never mind. Let him have the piece\". <br>Once she killed a snake. She saw a vision in her <br>dream, saying: \"Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) you killed a <br>Muslim\". <br>She replied: \"How could a Muslim come into the house of <br>the Prophet's widow?\" <br>Thevisionrejoined: \"But he had come in Purdah (dis- <br>guise)\". <br>She abruptly got uptfrom her sleep and at once spent <br>12 000 dirhams in Sadaqah, which was the blood-money <br>fixed for a Muslim killed by mistake. Hadhrat Urwah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once saw Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>spending 70 000 dirhams in charity, while she herself <br>was wearing a dress with patches.\" <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) Gets Angry <br>With Hadhrat Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhol: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>Hadhrat Aishah's (Radhiyallaho anha) nephew. He was <br>very dear to her, as she had brought him up. He did not <br>like her spending so much in charity, while she herself <br>5 s<br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6 Spirit for Islam <br>Ll a<br>0sI <br>lived in want and poverty. He mentioned this to somebody -8q <br>and said: <br>m<br>3 m  <br>\"I must stop my aunt from doing that\". <br>She learnt about this and was so much displeased that <br>she swore not to speak to Hadhrat Abdullah for the rest of <br>her life. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was very much shocked by her oath. He deputed many <br>people to speak to her for him, but she told them, \"I have <br>taken an oath and I am not prepared to violate it.\" He, at <br>last, took two persons from the family of the Prophet's <br>mother to her house to intercede for him. Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) allowed the persons to enter the house and <br>to speak to her from behind a curtain. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) also stealthily got in with these persons. <br>When these persons started talking, he could not control <br>himself and crossed the curtain and clung to his aunt, <br>crying and entreating her for pardon. The two persons also <br>interceded and reminded her of the Prophet's forbidding a <br>Muslim from forswearing speech with another Muslim. <br>When she heard this Hadith, she got frightened of Allah's <br>displeasure and the result thereof, and began to weep very <br>bitterly. She forgave Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>and began to speak with him. She then began liberating <br>slave after slave in expiation of her oath, till 40 slaves had <br>been set free by her. Even later on, whenever she thought of <br>the violation of her oath, she wept so much that her shawl <br>would become wet with her tears. <br>How much do we worry about the oaths we take from <br>morning till evening? It is for every one to examine his own <br>self and answer. Come and see the people who had real <br>reverence for Allah and His name; how deeply did they <br>feel.when they were unable to fulfil an oath. We see Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) weeping so much whenever <br>she remembered that incident about the violation of her <br>oath. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and Fear of <br>Allah: <br>Who does not know about the love that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had for his dear wife Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha)? It is said that when he was <br>asked whom he loved most, he replied, \"Aishah\". She was <br>so well-versed in Islamic jurisprudence that many eminent <br>Sahabah would go to her for solving their problems in this <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>1 <br>field. Jibrail used to greet her with 'Assalamo alaikum'. The <br>Prophet once told her that she would be his wife in the Par- <br>adise. When she was slandered by the Munafiqin, Allah <br>exonerated her from the slander and confirmed her inno- <br>cence by revealing verses in the Qur'an. <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once enumerated as <br>many as ten special virtues that Allah had given her over <br>the other wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Her spending in the path of Allah has already been nar- <br>rated in the previous stories. In spite of all these privileges <br>and virtues, she feared Allah so much that she was often <br>heard saying; <br>\"I wish I was a tree, so that I could be always busy in <br>Allah's tasbih and be absolved of reckoning on the Day <br>of Judgment\". <br>\"I wish I had been a stone or a clod of earth\". <br>\"I wish I had been a leaf of tree or a blade of grass\". <br>\"I wish I had not been born at all\". <br>The stories about the awe and fear of Allah, which <br>Sahabah had in their hearts, have already been given in <br>Chapter 11. This was the guiding factor of their lives. <br>5. Story of Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Ummul-Momineen Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was first,married to Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). The husband and wife were very much attached to <br>each other. Once Umme Salmah said to her husband: <br>\"I have heard that if a husband does not marry another <br>woman during the life or after the death of his wife, <br>and also if the wife does not remarry after the death of <br>her husband, the couple when admitted to paradise is <br>allowed to live there as husband and wife. Give me <br>your word that you will not marry after my death, and <br>I too pledge that I will not marry again if you happen <br>to die before me\". <br>Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Will you <br>do as I say?\" <br>She replied: \"Of course\". <br>He said: \"I want you to take a husband after my death\" <br>He then prayed, saying, \"0,Allah! Let Umme Salmah <br>be married after my death to a husband better than I. May <br>he give her no trouble whatsoever\". <br>In the beginning, the couple emigrate'd to Abyssinia. <br>After their return, they again emigrated to Madinah Hadh- <br>rat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"When my husband made up his mind to emigrate to <br>Madinah, he loaded the camel with the luggage. He <br>then made me and our son Salmah ride the camel. He <br>led the camel out of the town, holding the string in his <br>hand. The people of my father's clan (Banu Mughirah) <br>happened to see us leaving. They came and snatched <br>the,string from Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho's) hqnd saying, 'You can go wherever you like <br>but we cannot allow our girl to go and perish with <br>you.' They forcibly took me and my son back to their <br>clan. When the people of my husband's clan (Banu <br>Abdul Asad) learnt this, they came to Banu Mughirah <br>and began to argue with them saying, \"You can keep <br>your girl if you like, but you have no claim over the <br>child who belongs to our clan. Why should we allow <br>him to stay in your clan, when you have not allowed <br>your girl to go with her husband\". They forcibly took <br>the boy away. Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had already gone to Madinah. All the members <br>of the family were thus separated from each other. <br>Daily, I would go out in the desert and weep there <br>from morning till night. I lived in this condition for <br>one full year, separated from my husband and my son. <br>One day, one of my cousins taking pity on me said to <br>the people of the clan, 'You have separated this poor <br>woman from her husband and son. Why don't you <br>have mercy on her and let her go? Due to the humani- <br>tarian efforts of this cousin of mine, the people of Banu <br>Mughirah agreed to let me go and join my husband. <br>Banu Abdul Asad also made over my son to me. I got a <br>camel ready and, with my son in my lap, I sat on its <br>back and set off for Madinah all alone. I had hardly <br>gone four miles, when 'Hadhrat Usman-bin-Talhah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) met me at Tan'eem. He inquired, <br>'Where are you going?' I said, 'To Madinah! He re-<br>marked, 'With none accompanying you!, I said 'No, I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>have nobody except Allah to accompany me.' He took <br>the rope of my camel and began to lead. By Allah, I <br>have never come across a person more noble than <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). When I had to <br>get down, he would make the camel sit and himself go <br>behind a hush and when I had to climb up he would <br>bring the camel and make it sit close to me. He would <br>then hold the rope and lead the animal. Thus we <br>reached Quba (a suburb of Madinah). He informed me <br>that Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>staying there. He then made us over to my husband <br>and then returned all the way back toXMecca. By Allah, <br>no one else could bear the hardships that I bore during <br>that single year\". <br>Look at Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha's) <br>faith and trust.in Allah. She set out on a long and hazard- <br>ous journey all alone. See how Allah sent His help to her. <br>No doubt.Allah can depute anybody to render help to those <br>who place trust in Him, for the hearts of all people are in <br>His control. <br>As a rule, a lady is not permitted to travel alone on a <br>long journey, except in the event of obligatory emigration <br>for the sake of Allah. <br>6. \t<br>Ladies in the Khaibar Campaign: <br>Shoulder to shoulder with their menfolk, the ladies of <br>those times, imbued with the same spirit of sacrifice, were <br>striving heart and soul in the path of Allah, and no service <br>in this c~nnectionwa: too much for them. <br>Hadhrat Umme Ziyad (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"In the Khaibr campaign. I along with other five <br>women reached the battle-field. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam), having learnt this, sent for us. He <br>said with anger. 'Who permitted you to come over <br>here? Who brought you to this place?' We said. '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! we know knitting and we have some <br>medicines with us. We shall help the Mujahidin by <br>supplying them with arrows, by attending them when <br>they are sick, and by preparing food for them.' The <br>Prophet (Sallqllaho alaihe wasallam) permitted us to <br>stay.\" <br>The women of that time were blessed with the spirit <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>which even the men of our times do not possess. Look at <br>the courage of these women who reached the battle-field on <br>their own accord, and who offered to attend tb different <br>jobs in the field. <br>Hadhrat Umme Salim (Radhiyallaho anha) joined thb <br>Huneyn campaign in the state of pregnancy. She kept a <br>dagger on her person. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) inquired: <br>\"What is this dagger for, 0,Omme Salim?\" <br>She replied: \t \"I shall run it through the belly of any Kafir <br>approachingme\". <br>She bad also taken part in'the battle of Uhud. ~herein~she <br>tended the wounds of the fi&ting men. Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) says: <br>\"I saw ~ a d h r a t  Aishah and Hadbat Umme Sglim <br>(Radhi~allaho anhuma) ,running to and fro in the <br>battle-field, carrying water for the wounded\". <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho Pnha) in the <br>battle for Cyprus: <br>Upme Yaraq (Radhiy llaho anha) was an qunt of <br>Anas'[Radhiyallaho anhi). $hel\"Pophet (Sallallaho'alaihe <br>wasallam) often visited her and sometimes had his after- <br>noon nap at her, place. Once,he was,sleeping in her house, <br>when he woke up smiling. <br>Hadhrat Umme Haiam (Radhiyallaho a+a) said: <br>\"0,Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! You are <br>dearer to .me than my parents, teli me what made you <br>smile\". <br>He said: <br>\"I saw in my dream a few of my followers going for <br>Jihad across the sea. They, in their barges, looked like <br>kings sitting on their thrones\". <br>Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho anhaj said: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Pray that I may also be one <br>among those people\". <br>He replied: \"Rest assured, you will be one of themv <br>He went to sleep again, and got up smiling for the second <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>time. On Hadhrat Haram (Radhiyallaho anha's) query he <br>said: <br>\"I again saw some more people going for Jihad across <br>the sea\". <br>Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho anha) requested him <br>to pray for her joining them also, he said: <br>\"No, you are with the first group only.\" <br>During the Khilafat of Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Amir Muawiyah, the Governor of Syria, sought permission <br>to send an expeditionary force to Cyprus Island. This per- <br>mission was granted by Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho anha), with <br>her husband Hadhrat Ubadah [Radhiyallaho anho), was in <br>that force. While returning from the island she fell from her <br>mule, broke her neck and died. She was buried in Cyprus. <br>Look at the spirit of Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). She wanted to join both the expeditions. As she <br>was destined to die during the first expedition, the Prophet <br>(Sallailaho alaihe wasallam) did not pray for her partici- <br>pation in the second one. <br>8. <br>Story of Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Umme Sulaim [Radhiyallaho anha) was the mother of <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho). After the death of her <br>husband, she remained a widow for some time with a view <br>to devoting herself to the proper upbringing of her son. She <br>was then married to,Hadhrat Abu Talhah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and got a son named Abu Umair from him. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to go to her <br>hbuse and play with the child. <br>One day, Abu Umair was ill and Hadhrat Abu Talhah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) was fasting. While Hadhrat Abu <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) was out on his job, the child <br>died. She washed and enshrouded the dead body and laid <br>it on the cot. She then herself took a bath changed her <br>clothes and made her toilet. When the husband returned <br>home and had his Iftar he asked her: <br>\"How is the child?\" <br>'She replied: \"He is now in peace.\" <br>I <br>He was satisfied. The couple shared the bed for the night. <br>I <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>When they got up in the morning, they had the following <br>conversation. <br>Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"I have a question to ask you.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What is that?\" <br>Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Suppose a person is ,entrusted with something. <br>Should he deliver up on demand that which is en- <br>trusted to him or not?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"He must deliver up. He has no right to hold it back\". <br>Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Abu Umair was entrusted to us by Allah. He has <br>taken him back.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Ta'lhah (Radhiyallaho anho) was filled with <br>grief. He simply said: <br>\"But why did you not inform me before?\" <br>He went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and narrated the story to him. He prayed for him and said: <br>\"Allah is likely to bless your sharing the bed with your <br>wife last night.\" <br>One of the Sahabah says: <br>\"I lived to see the effect of the Prophet's blessing. As a <br>result of his union with his wife on that night, Hadhrat <br>Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) got a son named Ab- <br>dullah. This Abdullah had nine sons, all of whom <br>were Qaris.\" <br>It needs much courage and patience to do what Hadh- <br>rat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha) did at the death of <br>her son. She did not like her husband to know about the <br>death of the child while he was fasting and while he <br>needed food and rest. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umrne Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Be-<br>haviour With Her Fatht~r: <br>Hadhrat Ummul Mominin Umme Habibah (Radhiyal- <br>I <br>laho anha) was previously married to Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. <br>She emigrated with her husband to Abyssinia. The hus- <br>band turned renegade and died there ,as a Kafir. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alhihe wasallam) sent his offer to marry <br>her through king Negus, while she was still passing her <br>days in Abyssinia as a widow. She accepted the offer and <br>came to Madinah to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). During the period of truce between the Muslims <br>and the idolaters of Mecca, her father Hadhrat Abu Sufyan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once came to Madinah for negotia- <br>tions in connection with reinforcing the truce. He went to <br>see Umme Habibah. As he was about to sit on the bedding <br>in her room, she removed it from under him. He was sur- <br>prised over her behaviour and said: <br>\"Was the bedding unfit for me or I unfit for the bed- <br>ding?\" <br>She replied: \"This bedding is meant for the dear and holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), while you are an <br>idolater pnd therefore unclean. How can I allow you to <br>sit on this bedding?\" <br>Abu Sufyan was full of grief and remarked: <br>I \"Since you left us, you have developed bad manners.\" <br>In the face of the great reverence that she had for the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho al9ihe wasallam), she dould not tolerate <br>an unclean mushrik (though he be her own father) to sit on <br>the Prophet's bedding. <br>Once she came to know from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about the virtues of twelve rakaats of <br>Chasht. Since that time, she kept on offering this Salaat <br>regularly. <br>Her father Hadhrat Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>later embraced Islam. On the third day of his death, she <br>sent for some perfume and bsed it saying: <br>\"I neith'er need nor like the perfume. I have heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A woman <br>is not permitted to mourn the death of any person <br>(except her husband's) for more than three days. (The <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge b Spirit for Islam <br>181 4-4\"1<br>mourning period in case of husband's death is how- <br>ever four months and ten days.) I am using the per- '!J <br>fume simply to show that 1 am not mourning the death <br>of my father any longer.\" <br>When she was about to die, she sent for Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and said: <br>\"We have been rivals in sharing the love of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). It is just possible that we <br>might have offended each other. I forgive .you. Please <br>forgive me too.\" <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said: <br>\"I forgive you by all means. May Allah forgive you <br>too.\" <br>She remarked: <br>\"0, Aishah, you have made me very happy. May Allah <br>keep you happy.\" <br>Similarly, she sent for Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) and secured her forgiveness. <br>The tension between two rival wives is natural and <br>proverbial. Hadhrat Umme Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>wanted to be forgiven by people before she appeared before <br>Allah. Her reverence and love for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) can be judged from her behaviour towards <br>her own father. <br>10. \t The Story of Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>Hadhrat Ummul Mominin Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was a cousin of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>She accepted Islam soon after its advent. In the beginning, <br>she was married to Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>was a liberated slave and the adopted son of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was therefore, known as <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Muhammad (Radhiyallaho anho). Hadh- <br>rat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) could not pull on smoothly <br>with Zainab and at last divorced her. Now, according to the <br>pre-Islamic customs, an adopted son was treated as a real <br>son, so much so that his widow or divorced wife could not <br>be married to his adopted father. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), with a view to break this unjustified <br>custom, communicated to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>anha) his proposal for marriage. When Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) received the proposal, she said: <br>\"Let me consult my Lord!\" <br>She then performed Wudhu and stood up in her Salaat. Her <br>action was so much blessed by Allah that the following <br>verse was revealed to the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>-<br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (hence forth) there mav be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed necessary formality (of <br>release) from them. The commandment of Allah must <br>be fulfilled.\" <br>When Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was in-<br>formed of the good news that Allah had given her in the <br>Prophet's mdrriage and had revealed a verse to that effect, <br>she made over to the reporter in gratification all her jewell- <br>ery that she was wearing at that time. Then she fell down . <br>in Sajdah and vowed to keep fast for two months. She was <br>justly proud of the fact that, while every other wife of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was given in the mar- <br>riage to him by her relations, she was given by Allah, as <br>mentioned in Qur'an! As Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was also proud of being the most beloved wife; of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), there was always <br>some rivalry between the two. In spite of all this, when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha's) opinion about Hadhrat Aishah (Kad- <br>hiyallaho anha) in the matter of the slander against Hadhrat <br>r <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), she said: <br>\"I find everything good in Aishah.\" <br>Look at her integrity and strong character. Had she <br>i <br>wished, she could have harmed the reputation of her rival <br>and lowered her, in the eyes of their common husband, <br>who loved Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) so much. <br>On the other hand, she praised her in very strong words. <br>8 3<br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was a very pious <br>.=% <br>lady. She fasted very often and would say her Nafl Salaat <br>Wm <br>very frequently. She earned by working with her hands, <br>and spent all that she earned in the path of Allah. <br>At the time of the Prophet's death, his wives asked <br>him: <br>\"Which of us will join you first?\" <br>Me said: \"The one with long arms.\" <br>They began to measure their arms with a stick. They, how- <br>ever, came to know later that long hands symbolised lavish <br>spending in charity. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was indeed the first to die after the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). <br>Hadhrat Barazah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>Hadhrat \"Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to pay an <br>annual allowance to the Ummahat-ul-Mominin from <br>the Baitul Maal. He sent 12 000 dirhams to Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) through me as her share. <br>She thought that it was for all of them, and said to me, <br>'Umar should have asked somebody else to distribute <br>this money.' I said, 'It is the annual share for you <br>alone.' She asked me to throw it in the corner of a <br>room and cover it with a piece of cloth. Then she men- <br>tioned the names of some poor persons. widows and <br>her relatives, and asked me to give one handful to each <br>of them. After I had distributed as desired, some <br>money was still left under the cloth. I expressed a <br>desire to have something for myself. She said, 'You <br>take the rest.' I counted the money. It was eighty four <br>dirhams. Then she lifted her hands in prayer and said, <br>'0,Allah keep this money away from me, for it brings <br>temptation.' She died before the allowance for the next <br>year could be paid to her. When Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know of what she had done <br>with the money, he sent her another 1000 dirhams for <br>her personal needs but even those she spent in no <br>time. Although during the last portion of her life, the <br>Muslims were conquering territory after territory, and <br>wealth was pouring into Madinah, yet she left no <br>money or other wealth after her, except the house <br>where she lived. She was called Ma'wal Masaakeen, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>(refuge of the poor), due to her lavish spending in <br>charity.\" <br>A woman narrates: <br>\"I and Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) were <br>dyeing our clothes with red ochre. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) came in, but went out again <br>when he saw us engaged ih dyeing. Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) felt that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had perhaps not liked our dyeing in <br>that colour. She immediately washed all the dyed <br>clothes till their colour was gone.\" <br>Everybody knows the love and liking of women for <br>money and colours. But look at these ladies, who would <br>push away the money coming to them and who were pre- <br>pared to discard any colour on receiving the least hint of <br>the Prophet's disapproval. <br>11. \t Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) Exhorts Her <br>Sons to Bravery. <br>Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) was a famous po- <br>etess. She embraced Islam in Madinah, along with some <br>others of her clan. Ibn Athir writes: <br>\"All masters of literature are unanimous in declaring <br>I-iadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) as the best <br>woman poet in Arabic. No woman in history has ever <br>written such poetry as Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) .\" <br>? <br>During the time of 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>16 A.H, the famous hattle of Qadisivyah was fought be- <br>tween the Muslims and the Persians. Hadhrat Khansa (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha), along with her four sons, took part in this <br>battle. On the eve of the battle, she exhorted all her four <br>sons, saying: <br>I <br>\"0, My sons! You embraced Islam and emigrated of <br>your own free will. By Allah, beside Whom there is no <br>God, you all are the sons of the same father, just as you <br>are the sons of the same mother. I never betrayed your <br>,* <br>father, nor defamed your maternal uncle. I never al- <br>lowed a blot to come on your high birth nor polluted <br>your pedigree.

Endure, outdo all others in endur- <br>ance, be ready and observe your duty to Allah, in order <br>that Ye may succeed. (III:200)\" <br>When you get up tomorrow morning, be prepared to <br>contribute your best in the battle. Go ahead into the <br>enemy lines, seeking help from Allah. When you see <br>the flames of war rising high, get right into the centre <br>and face the enemy chiefs. Inshallah you will get your <br>abode in paradise with honour and success.\" <br>Next day, when the battle was in full swing, all the <br>four sons.advanced towards the enemy lines. One by one, <br>they attacked the enemy, reciting the words of their mother <br>in verses and fought till all of them were martyred. When <br>the mother got the news, she said: <br>\"Alhamdulillah. Glory to Allah Who has honoured me <br>with their martyrdom. I hope that Allah will unite me <br>with them under the shade of His Mercy.\" <br>Here is a mother of that time. She exhorts her sons to <br>jump into the flames of battle and, when all the sons are <br>killed in quick succession, she glorifies Allah and thanks <br>Him. <br>12. \t Hadhrat Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) Kills A Jew <br>Hadhrat Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the aunt of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a real sister of <br>Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho). She took part in the <br>battle of Uhud. When the Muslims were defeated and some <br>of them began to flee from the battle, she would smite their <br>faces with her spear and excite them to go back and fight. <br>In the war of the Khandaq (Trench), the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had collected all the Muslim <br>women in a fortress and had deputed Hadhrat Hassaan bin <br>Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) to look after them. The Jews, <br>who were always on the look-out for such opportunities for <br>doing mischief, surrounded the place and sent one of them <br>3,<br>'a <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>to find out if there were any men with the ladies. Hadhrat <br>Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) happened to see the Jew ap- <br>proaching the fort. She said to Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"There is a Jew coming to spy on us. You go out and <br>kill him.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was a weak person. <br>He did not make bold to do the job. Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) got hold of a tent peg and went outside the fortress <br>and gave a blow on the head of the Jew that killed him on <br>the spot. She came back and said to Hassaan: <br>\"The man is dead. I have not removed the clothes and <br>arms from his body for reasons of modesty. Now you <br>go and remove everything from his body. Also bring <br>his head after severing it from the body.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was too weak-<br>hearted to do that even. She herself went again and brought <br>his head, and threw it over the wall amidst the Jews. When <br>they saw this, they said: <br>\"We were wondering how Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) could keep the womenfolk alone in <br>this fort. Surely, there are men inside to guard the <br>ladies.\" <br>Safiyyah died in 20 A.H. at the age of seventy three. <br>The war of the Trench was fought in 5 A.H. She was, there- <br>fore, 58 then. These days, a lady of that age is hardly able <br>to do her domestic work. But look how Saffiyyah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) goes and kills a Jew all alone. <br>13. \t ZIadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha's) Interview With <br>the Pmphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Regarding <br>the Reward for Women. <br>Hadhrat Asrna birityazid Ansari (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than my <br>parents. My Muslim women have deputed me as their <br>representative to talk to you on their behalf. Verily you <br>are the Prophet of Allah for both men and women. We <br>stay for most part of our time within the four walls of <br>our houses. We remain pinned to our duties of fulfil- <br>ling the sexual desires of men, bearing children for <br><br>187 2%<br>a<br>Ch.

Notwithstanding <br>.CM 43 <br>all this, men excel us in getting rewards for things <br>s m  <br>which we are unable to do. They go and say their daily <br>Salaat and weekly Jumu'ah in the musjid, visit the <br>sick, attend the funerals, perform Hajj after Hajj and, <br>above all, fight in the way of Allah. When they go for <br>Hajj or Jehad, we look after their property, bring up <br>their children and weave cloth for them. Do we not <br>share their rewards with them?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) addressing the <br>Sahabah sitting round him, said: <br>\"Did you ever hear a woman asking a better question?\" <br>Sahabah replied: \"0, Prophet of Allah! We never thought <br>that a woman could ever put such a <br>question.\" <br>The Pmphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) addressing Asma <br>said: <br>\"Listen attentively, and then go and tell the ladies who <br>have sent you that when a woman seeks the pleasure <br>of her husband and carries out her domestic functions <br>to his satisfaction, she gets the same reward as the men <br>get for all their services to Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) returned very happily <br>after getting this reply to her question. <br>Obedience to and good behaviour towards husbands is <br>a very great asset for the women, provided they know its <br>value. <br>The Sahabah once said to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam): <br>\"In foreign countries, people prostrate before their <br>kings and chiefs. You deserve such reverence much <br>more.\" <br>He said, \"No. If it were permissible to prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah. I would asked the women to <br>prostrate before their husbands.\" <br>He then said, <br>\"By him Who has my life in His hand, a woman <br>cannot do what she owes to Allah until she has done <br>what she owes to her husband.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>It is reported in a Hadith that once a camel bowed in <br>prostration before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Sahabah on seeing this, said: <br>\"When this animal prostrates before you, why should <br>we not have this honour too?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"Never. If I could make somebody prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah, I would ask the wives to prostrate <br>before their husbands.\" <br>The following is reported to have been said by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in this connection: <br>(1) \"A woman whose husband is pleased with her at <br>the time of her death goes straight into Paradise.\" <br>(2) \t \"A woman is cursed by the angels if her husband <br>is displeased with her, and she stays away from <br>him in anger for the night.\" <br>(3) \t \"The Salaat of two persons hardly rises beyond <br>their heads in its flight to heaven. These two per- <br>sons are a run-away slave and a disobedient wife.\" <br>14. \t The Story of Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha) is one <br>of those Ansar who embraced Islam in the very beginning. <br>She was among the group that vowed allegience to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at Al-Aqabah. Al- <br>Aqabah in Arabic means a narrow Mountain Pass. In the <br>early days of Islam, the new Muslims were persecuted by <br>Qureysh very badly. They would put all hurdles in the way <br>of Tabligh. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), there- <br>fore, carried on his mission quietly and secretly. People <br>from Madinah who used to come to Mecca for Hajj usually <br>embraced Islam secretly in a mountain pass near Mina, so <br>that Qureysh might not see them. She was in the third such <br>group from Madinah. She participated in most of the <br>battles that were fought after emigration. She took promi- <br>nent part in Uhud, Hudeybiah, Khaiber. Umratul Qadha, <br>Huneyn and Yamamah. <br>In the battle of Uhud, she was forty-three. Her husband <br>and two sons were also fighting in the battle. She took a <br><br>0 9  <br>Q) <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>189 $ 3  <br>8 2 <br>leather bottle full of water and headed for Uhud. In the be- <br>.e <br>ginning, the Muslims had an upper hand, but the tables g*<br>were turned in another moment and the enemy were in the <br>winning position. She had reached the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), when wave after wave of enemy troops <br>rushed to attack and kill him. She shielded the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) whenever anybody ap-<br>proached him. She had a cloth-belt round her waist full of <br>pieces of lint. She tended the wounded. She herself got <br>about twelve wounds, one of which was very serious. <br>Hadhrat Umme Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I once saw a very deep cut on the shoulder of Hadhrat <br>Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha). I inquired how <br>she had got that. She said, 'I got it in Uhud. When <br>people were running about in confusion, I saw Ibn <br>Qumiah coming towards us and shouting, 'where is <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Let some-<br>body tell me his whereabouts. If he is saved today, I <br>am no more.' I, Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some others intercepted him. He gave <br>me this deep cut on my shoulder. I also attacked him, <br>but he escaped on account of the double coat of mail <br>that he was wearing.\" <br>In spite of a year's treatment, the wound would not heal. In <br>the meantime, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided about the expedition to Hamra-ul-Asad. Hadhrat <br>Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha) also got ready to join <br>the expedition. But as her wound was still unhealed, she <br>could not participate. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) returned from the expedition, he straight away <br>went to visit Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). He was very happy to find her better. <br>She says: <br>\"In fact, we were very much handicapped in Uhud. <br>The enemy had very strong cavalry, while we fought <br>on foot. There would have been a fair fight if they too <br>had been on foot. When somebody came riding on his <br>horse to attack me, I stopped his sword on my shield <br>and when he turned about, I attacked his horse from <br>the rear and cut its leg. This caused the horse as well <br>as the rider to fall on the ground. As soon as this hap- <br>pened, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>shout to my son, who would run to my help and then <br>we both finished the man in no time.\" <br>Her son Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I had a wound on my left arm, which would not stop <br>bleeding. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said to my mother, 'Put a bandage over it.' My mother <br>took out a bandage from her belt and after bandaging <br>f'<br>my wound, said, 'Now, son. go and fight again with <br>the idolaters.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was watching us. He said, '0, Umme Ammarah, <br>who can have courage like yours?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at that time <br>prayed again and again for Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) and her family. Hadhra: Umme Ammarah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was standing with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), when one of the enemy passed in front of me. <br>The Pro~;?et (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] said to me, <br>Umme Ammarah! He is the man who wounded your <br>son.' I jumped at hirn and hit his leg. It made him fall <br>down. We then went foiward and finished him. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) smiled and said, <br>'Umme Ammarah has avenged her son.' When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was praying for <br>us, I said to him, '0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for my <br>company with you in Paradise.' He favoured me with <br>this prayer too, and after that I cared little for what <br>happened to me ,in this life.\" <br>As has already been said, she also participated in <br>many other battles with the same zeal and spirit. After the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she took <br>part in the fierce battle of Yamamah, which was fought <br>with the renegades. She lost one of her arms and received <br>eleven other wounds in this battle. She was forty-three in <br>Uhud and fifty-two in Yamamah. Her heroism in these <br>battles at that age was really miraculous. <br>15. \t Story of Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) was the <br>wife of Ikramah bin Abi Jahl. She participated in Uhud on <br>the enemy side. She embraced Islam on the fall of Mecca. <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6. Spirit for Islam <br>She loved her husband very much, who would not become <br>a Muslim on account of his father, who was the worst <br>enemy of Islam. After the fall of Mecca, her husband fled to <br>Yemen. She secured pardon for him from the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and went to Yemen and induced <br>her husband to return to his home. She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts. We shall <br>meet after they are done away with.\" <br>He said: \"I am sure I shall not survive this battle.\" <br>They then shared the bed for the first time in a tent at that <br>place. Next day, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was arranging for the Walimah when the enemy at- <br>tacked with full force and he was killed in the battle. Hadh- <br>rat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) packed up her tent <br>and other luggage, and, with a tent-peg in her hand, fought <br>the enemy till she had killed seven of them. <br>In war times, not to speak of a woman, no man would <br>like to get married under such circumstances. Look at her <br>marriage in the battle-field and her fight with the enemy! <br>Instead of mourning the loss of her husband on the day of <br>his death, she rushes in to the battle-field and kills seven of <br>the enemy soldiers single-handed. Is this not enough to <br>show the wonderful strength of Iman in women of that <br>time? <br>16. \t Martyrdom of Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) is the mother <br>of 'Hadhrat Ammar (Radhiyallaho anho), whose story we <br>have already read in Chapter V. Just like 'Hadhrat Ammar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) her son, and Yasir her husband, she <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>patiently bore the hardships in various forms in the cause <br>i <br>of Islam. She would not weaken in her love for and devo- <br>tion to Islam in spite of all these afflictions. One day, <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was standing <br>when Abu Jahl passed that way. He flung all sorts of dirty <br>words at her and then put his spear through her private <br>parts. She died on account of the wound. She is the first to <br>meet martyrdom for the cause of Islam. <br>Patience, perseverence and sacrifice of these ladies are <br>really enviable. No affliction is too much when a person <br>blessed with the spirit of Islam is determined to bear it. We <br>hear about hundreds of persons dying for one cause or the <br>other. It is only dying for the cause of Allah that brings <br>eternal happiness and comfort in the life to come. Persons <br>losing their lives for material gains really lose twice, i.e., in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. <br>17. The story of Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). <br>Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anha) is <br>the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>mother of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and step-sister of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). She is one of the famous women of her time. She <br>was the eighteenth person to embrace Islam. She was <br>twenty-seven years old at the time of the Hijrat. After the <br>migration from Mecca, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Madinah safely, they sent Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some other Sahabah to bring their families <br>from Mecca. Hadhrdt Asma (Radhiyallaho anho) came to <br>Madinah with Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>family. When she reached Quba, she gave birth to Hadh- <br>rat-Abdullah <br>bin-Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), the first <br>Muslim baby born since the Hijrat. She says: <br>\"When I was married to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), he had neither money nor property of any kind. <br>He had only one camel for carrying water and one <br>horse. I would bring fodder for the animals and date- <br>stones to feed them in lieu of grass, bring water from <br>the well, mend bucket myself when needed, and <br>attend to other domestic duties. Attending to the horse <br>was the most difficult of all jobs. I was not good at <br>baking and, therefore, after kneading the flour, I would <br>Ch. X :  Women's Courage S. Spirit for Islam <br>take it to Ansar women in my neighbourhood, who <br>would bake bread for me. When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it. (In fact, <br>Sahabah remained occupied in striving in the path of <br>Allah and all other such jobs had to be done by their <br>womenfolk. Sometime later, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) transferred to us a servant that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given to him. <br>I was therefore relieved of attending to the horse, <br>which had been really very hard for me.\" <br>18. \t Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) Pacifies her <br>Grandfather. <br>When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) emi- <br>grated to Madinah in the company of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), he took with him all his money, <br>thinking that the Prophet might need it. It was about 6 000 <br>dirhams. After his departure, his father Abu Quhafah (who <br>was blind and who had not till then accepted Islam) came <br>to express his synlpathy with his granddaughters. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Our grandfather came to us and said, 'Your father has <br>shocked you with his migration to Madinah, and <br>seems to have put you to further hardship by taking all <br>his money with him.' I said, 'No grandfather, do not <br>worry. He has left a lot of money for us.' I collected <br>some pebbles and deposited them in the recess where <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>my father used to keep his money; I covered it with a <br>cloth. I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>said: <br>\"No body's wealth has benefited me so much as that of <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). I have com- <br>pensated everybody for the good done to me, except <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). He shall be <br>compensated by Allah Himself.\" <br>19. \t Hadhrat Asma '(Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending in <br>Charity. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the path of Allah. In the beginning, <br>she used to spend carefully with measure and weight. Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to her: <br>\"0,Asma, do not put by and be calculating; spend in <br>the path of Allah liberally.\" <br>After this, she started spending most generously. She <br>would advise her daughters and house maids: <br>\"Don't wait for any surplus or excess' of requirements <br>before spending in the path of Allah. As the require- <br>ments go on increasing in the chances of having some- <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age. She came of age and then accepted Islam. She was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. Her husband <br>fought in Badr for Qureysh and fell a captive to the Mus- <br>lims. <br>When the Qureysh were paying ransom to secure re- <br>lease of their prisoners, Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) gave over as ransom for her husband the necklace <br>she had received in dowry from her mother Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha). When the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saw the necklace, the memories of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) came to his mind and <br>tears were in his eyes. After consultation with Sahabah, he <br>returned the necklace to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>ahna) and released her husband without ransom on the <br>condition that he would send Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) to Madinah on his return to Mecca. Two men <br>were sent to stay outside Mecca and bring Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) safely to Madinah, when she was <br>made over to them. Her husband asked his brother Kinanah <br>to take Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) outside Mecca <br>and make her over to the Muslim escort. As Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) and Kinanah were moving out <br>of the town on camel's back, the Qureysh sent a party to in- <br>tercept them. Her own cousin Habar bin Aswad flung a <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave. This was all <br>for the instruction of his followers. (0,Allah! protect us <br>from the horrors of the grave by Thy special Favour. Grace <br>and Bounty). <br>I<br>*,+;C, & i;Chi;, r;611, <br>21. Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) High-minded- <br>ness: <br>Rubayyi-bint-Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha) was a <br>woman of Ansar, who had participated in many battles, by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>nursed the wounded and carried the dead bodies during <br>i <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>197 3<br>h= <br>0s <br>the battle. She had accepted Islam before the Prophet emi- <br>'G8 a <br>grated to Madinah. She was married when the Prophet was <br>~m <br>in Madinah. He graced her marriage with his presence. He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father. She, therefore, retorted: <br>\"No. I am the daughter of one who killed his slave.\" <br>Asma did not like this epithet for Abu Jahl, and said with <br>anger: <br>\"It is haram for me to sell perfume to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho hnha) said, in the same <br>strain, <br>\"It is haram for me to buy perfume from you. I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam. She could <br>not tolerate an enemy of Islam being mentioned as a chief. <br>We hear from the lips of Muslims most flowery and high <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>sounding epithets being used for the open enemies of <br>Islam. When they are reminded, they call it narrow-mind- <br>f<br>edness. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>i <br>\"Don't call a Munafiq a chief. You displease Allah <br>when you take him as a chief.\" <br>22. Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>this marriage could not take place. Her first husband was <br>Atiq bin Aa'iz. She had a daughter from him, whose name <br>was Hind. H'nd grew up and embraced Islam, and she was <br>the mother o \\ many children. On the death of Atiq. Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Abu Halah and got <br>two children from him viz. Hind and Halah. Hind lived up <br>to the time of Ali's Caliphate. On the dzath of Abu Halah, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her as his <br>first wife. She died in Ramadhan of the 10th year of the <br>mission at the age df sixty-five. He loved her very much <br>and did not marry any other woman during her life time. <br>She was populprly called Tahirah (Clean and pure) even <br>before Islam. Her children from other husbands are there- <br>fore known as Banu Tahirah. Her virtues and privileges <br>have been mentioned extensively (in Hadith). The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) laid her in the grave with his <br>own hands. The funeral service had not till then been en- <br>joined. <br>(2)Hadhrat Sauda (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>L. <br>Hadhrat Sauda bint Zam'ah bin Qais (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was previously married to her cousin Hadhrat <br>Sukran bin 'Amor (Radhiyallaho anho). The couple em- <br>braced Islam and emigrated to Abysinnia. Hadhrat Sukran <br><br>Ch. X:Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>199 3<br>CI0 43 <br>.!2 m <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) died in Abyssinia. Hadhrat Saudah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), now a widow, returned to Mecca. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), on the death of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>favour of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), but I <br>don't like to be divorced (by you). I wish to be in Par- <br>adise as one of your wives.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to this <br>suggestion. She died in about 55 A. H. towards the end of <br>the Khilafat of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>There was another Qureysh woman of the same name. <br>She was also a widow having about six children. The <br>Prophet offered to marry her, but she said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than any <br>other person in this world. I do not like my children to <br>be a nuisance to you.\" <br>He appreciated this, and withdrew the offer. <br>(3)Hadhrat A.ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) too was married <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in Swawwal of <br>the 10th year of the Nubuwwat. She was born in the 4th <br>year of Nubuwwat and was married when she was six, but <br>was actually sent by her parents to live with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) after his emigration to Madi- <br>nah, when she was nine. She was eighteen at the time of <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>thes Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's death. She died <br>on the night of Tuesday, the 17th Ramadhan, 57 A. H., at <br>the age of sixty-six. She desired at the time of her death <br>that she might be buried, along with other Ummahat-ul- <br>Momineen, in the public graveyard, though she could be <br>buried by the side of the Prophet's grave, which was in her <br>house. She was the only wife of the Prophet who had not <br>been married previously. All the remaining wives had <br>either been widowed or divorced (some quite a few times) <br>before they became Ummuhat-ul-Momineen. To be married <br>in Shawwal was considered a bad omen among the Arab <br>women. Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was married in Shawwal. It was also Shawwal when <br>I was sent to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasailam). Which of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam's) wives has been more blessed with his love <br>! <br>and Allah's other favours than me?\" <br>Oh the death of Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), <br>Hadhrat Khaulah bint Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Don't you like to marry again?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Whom can I marry?\" <br>Khaylah: <br>\"I know one virgin and one widow.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Name them.\" <br>Khaulah: <br>t <br>\"The virgin is Aishah, (Radhiyallaho anha) the daugh- <br>ter of your bosom friend Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), and the widow is Saudah bint Zam'ah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"All right! You may make the proposal.\" <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anha) then went to <br>Hadhrat Aisha (Radhiyallaho anha's) mother Hadhrat <br>Umme-Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha) and said to her: <br>C <br>\"I have come with good tidings for your family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"What is that?\" <br><br>.C <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>201 2a <br>LI0sa <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>8 :  <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has sent me $d<br>* <br>to seek Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha's) hand for <br>him\" <br>Hadhrat Umme Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"But 'Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) is like his <br>niece. How can she be married to him? Let me consult <br>her father.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was not at <br>home at that time. When he came, the proposal was placed <br>before him, and he expressed the same difficulty. Hadhrat <br>Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and apprised him of their diffi- <br>culty. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Abu Bakr is my bosom friend and brother-in-Islam, <br>but this does not forbid my marrying his daughter.\" <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and informed <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) accordingly. Abu <br>Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho) was extremely glad to call the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to his home and per- <br>form Aishah's (Radhiyallaho anha) Nikah with him. A few <br>months later, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had emigrated to Madinah, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) said to the Prophet: <br>\"Why don't you have your wife Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to live with you?\" <br>He said: \"I have to make some preparations, etc., before I <br>do that.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) presented him with <br>some money, with which necessary things were arranged. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anho) then started living <br>with the Prophet from Shawwal of 1 or 2 A. H. She shared <br>the bed with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the first time in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>house. <br>These are the three marriages, which the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had before Hijrah. All the remain- <br>ing wives were taken by him in Madinah. <br>(4) Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hafsah was the daughter of 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>laho anho) who was born in Mecca five years before the <br>Nubuwwat. She was first married to Hadhrat Khunais bin <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho), who was one of the very <br>early Muslims. He first emigrated to Abyssinia and then to <br>Madinah. He participated in Badr, and was fatally <br>wounded in Badr (or in Uhud) and died of the wound in <br>the year 1 or 2 A. H. Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had also emigrated to Madinah with her husband. When <br>her husband died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went <br>to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and said: <br>\"I want to give Hafsah in marriage to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) kept quiet and said <br>nothing. Meanwhile Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) the <br>daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and <br>the wife of 'Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) died. <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat <br>Usman (Radhiyailaho anho) and offered Hadhrat Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho's) hand to him. He declined by saying. <br>\"I have no mind to marry for the present.\" 'Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) complained of this to the Prophet. The <br>Prophet said: <br>\"I tell you of a husband for Hafsah better than 'Usman, <br>and of a wife for 'Usma.n better than Hafsah.\" <br>He then took Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) as his <br>next wife, and gave his own daughter Hadhrat Umme <br>Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) in marriage to 'Hadhrat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) Usman. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) later said to 'Hadhrat 'Usman Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>I <br>\"When you offered Hafsah's hand to me, I kept quiet as <br>the Prophet had expressed to me his intention of mar- <br>rying her. I could neither accept your offer nor disclose <br>the Prophet's secret to you. I, therefore. kept quiet. If <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had changed <br>his mind, I would have gladly married her.\" <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abu Bakr's silence over the offer was in fact more <br>shocking to me than 'Usman's rejection.\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha) was a very pious <br>woman, and very much devoted to Salaat. She would often <br>fast during the day and spend the night in prayers. Once <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), for some reason, <br>was displeased with Hafsah and even pronounced the first <br>divorce to her. 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was na- <br>turally very much shocked over this. Jibra-eel Alayhis came <br>to the Prophet (Sallal Salaam laho alaihe wasallam) and <br>said: <br>\"Allah wants you to take Hafsah back, as she is fasting <br>often and spending her nights in Salaat, and also Allah <br>wants it for Hadhrat Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>sake.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) therefore <br>took her back. She died in Jamadil oola, 45 A. H., at the age <br>of 63. <br>(5) Hadhrat Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was the next to be <br>married to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). There <br>are divergent reports about her previous husbands. Accord- <br>ing to one report, she was first married to Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) who was killed in Uhud, <br>as we have already seen in his story in chapter VI1. Accord-<br>ing to another report, she was first married to Tufail ibnul <br>a1 Harith and when divorced by him was remarried to <br>his brother Ubaidah ibnul Harith, who was killed in Badr. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her in <br>Ramadhan, 3 A. H. She lived with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) for eight months only, as she died in <br>Rabi-ul-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Zainab and Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) are the two wives of the <br>Prophet who died during his life time. All the other wives <br>lived on after him and died later. Hadhrat Zainab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) spent very liberally on the poor, and was <br>known as 'Ummul Masakin' (mother of the poor) even <br>before Islam. <br>After her death, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) married Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>(6) Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Ummayvah. <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). She was first married to her cousin <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdul Asad known as Abu Salamah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). The couple embraced Islam in the <br>very beginning and emigrated to Abyssinia, due to the per- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>secutions of Qureysh. A son was born to them in exile, who <br>was named Salamah. After returning from Abyssinia, the <br>family emigrated to Madinah. Hadhrat Umme Salamah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) story about her journey to Madinah <br>has been already given in the early part of the chapter. <br>After reaching Madinah, Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) got another son 'Umar and two daughters, <br>Durrah and Zainab (Radhiyallaho anhum). Hadhrat Abu <br>Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) was the eleventh man to em- <br>brace Islam. He participated in the battle of Badr as well as <br>in Uhud. He got a severe wound in Uhud, which did not <br>heal for a long time. He was sent by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in an expedition in Safar, 4 A. H. When <br>he returned from the expedition, the old wound again <br>started giving trouble and at last he died of the same on 8th <br>Jamadil-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was pregnant at the time. Zainab was born to <br>her after the death of her husband. After she had completed <br>her Iddat (waiting period), Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) proposed to marry her, but she declined. <br>Later, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) offered <br>to marry her. She said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have quite a few children with <br>me and I am very sensitive by nature. Moreover, all my <br>people are in Mecca, and their permission for getting <br>remarried is necessary.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Allah will look after your children and your sensi- <br>tiveness will vanish in due course. None of your <br>people will dislige the proposed marriage\". <br>She then asked her (eldest) son Hadhrat Salamah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to serve as her guardian and give her in <br>marriage to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was married in the end of Shawwal, 4 A. H. <br>She says: \t \"I had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that a person struck with a calamity <br>should recite this prayer: <br>\"0,Allah! Recompense me for this affliction by giving <br>me something better than what I have lost: then Allah <br>L :\" <br>k \" \t<br>i <br>i <br>i <br>I I <br>i <br>1 \t<br>I \t<br>t \t<br>k5<br>a, oec<br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6. Spirit for Islam <br>8 3<br>would accept his prayer.\" I had been reciting this <br>.=% <br>prayer since the death of Hadhrat Abu Salamah (Rad- <br>z m  <br>hiyallaho anho), but I could not imagine a husband <br>better than he. till Allah arranged my marriage with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) was famous for <br>her beauty. Once I contrived to see her. I found her <br>much more beautiful than I had heard. I mentioned <br>this to Hafsah who said. \"In my opinion, she is not as <br>beautiful as people say.\" <br>She was the last of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam's) wives to die. It was in 59 or 62 A. H. She was 84 at <br>the time of her death, and as, such she was born 9 years <br>before Nubuwwat. <br>As has already been said, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) married her after the death of Hadhrat <br>Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha). She therefore <br>lived in Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha's) house. She <br>found a hand-mill, a kettle and some barley in an earthen <br>jar, lying in the house. She milled some barley and after <br>putting some fat cooked a preparation, which she served to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on the very first <br>day of her marriage with him. <br>(7) Hadhrat Zainab bint Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) <br>cousin. She was first given in marriage by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) to his adopted son Hadhrat Zaid <br>bin Hari thah (Radhiyallaho anho). When Hadhrat Zaid <br>(~adhi~allaho<br>anho) divorced her, she was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by command of Allah, <br>as mentioned in Soorah A1 Ahzab. This took place in 5 A. <br>H; at that time, she was 35. She w 2s therefore born 17 years<br>before Nabuwat. She was always proud of the fact that, <br>while all the other wives were given in marriage to the <br>Prophet by their guardians, it was Allah Himself Who did <br>this for her. When Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) div- <br>orced her and she had completed her Iddat, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sent the proposal to her. She <br>said: <br>\"I cannot \t say anything until I have consulted my <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Allah.\" She performed Wudhu, said two rakaat of Salaat, <br>and prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy Prophet proposes to marry me. If I am <br>fit for the honour, then give me in his marriage.\" <br>Allah answered her prayer by revealing the following verse <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed the necessary formality <br>(of release) from them. The Commandment of Allah <br>must be fulfilled.\" <br>(XXXIII:37) <br>When she received the good news about this revel- <br>ation, she prostrated before Allah in thanksgiving. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) arranged a big feast of <br>Walimah for this marriage. A goat was slaughtered and <br>mutton-curry with bread was served to the guests. People <br>came in groups, and were served till all of them were fed. <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the way of Allah. She earned by <br>working with her hands and spent all her earnings in <br>charity. It was about,her that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prophesied: <br>\"My wife with long hands will be the first to meet me <br>after my death.\" <br>The wives took this to mean the physical length of arms <br>and began to measure their hands with a stick. The hands <br>of Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha) came out to be the <br>longest by measurement. But when Hadhrat Zainab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) died first, the meaning of the metaphor <br>used by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dawned <br>upon them. She fasted very often. She died in 20 A. H.and <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) led the funeral service. She was <br>fifty at the time of her death. <br>(8) Hadhrat Juwairiah bintul Harith (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>/ <br>!</p></div>"

X: Women's Coumge 6 Spirit for Islam <br>4 <br>Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the daugh- <br>ter of Harith, the chief of Banu Mustaliq and was married <br>to Musafe' bin Safwan. <br>She was one of the large number of captives who fell <br>into Muslim hands after the battle of Muraisee', and she <br>was given to Hadhrat Thabit bin Qais (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He offered to release her for 360 Dirhams. She came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am the daughter of Harith who <br>is the chief of the tribe, and you know my story. The <br>ransom demanded by Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is too much for me. I have come to seek your <br>help in the matter.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to pay her <br>ransom, set her free, and offered to take her as his wife. She <br>was very glad to accept this offer. She was married to the <br>Prophet in 5 A. H. and as a consequence of this marriage, <br>the prisoners of Banu Mustaliq (Juwairiah's tribe), about a <br>hundred families, were all set free by the Muslims. \"The <br>tribe which was so honoured by the Prophet's relation- <br>ship,\" they said, \"should not remain in slavery.\" <br>Such were the noble expediences in all the marriages <br>of the Prophet. Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>very pretty, her face was very attractive. Three days before <br>her falling captive in the battle, she had seen in her dream <br>the moon coming out from Madinah and falling into her <br>lap. She says: <br>\"When I was captured, I began to hope that my dream <br>would come true.\" <br>She was 20 at the time of her marriage with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She died in Rabi-ul-Awwal, <br>50 A. H., in Madinah at the age of 65. <br>, <br>(9) Hadhrat Umme Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Abu Sufyan, and was first <br>married to Ubaidullah bin Jahsh in Mecca. The couple em- <br>braced Islam, and then emigrated to Abyssinia due to per- <br>secution by the Qureysh. One night she saw her husband <br>(in a dream) in the most ugly and obnoxious form. The next <br>day she came to know that he had turned Christian. She, <br>however, remained a Muslim and was therefore separated <br>from him. She was now all alone in exile. But Allah soon <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>recomperised her loss. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) sent her an offer of marriage through the King <br>Negus, who sent a woman named Abrahah to her with the <br>message. She was so happy with the good news that she <br>made over the bracelets and other jewellery that she was <br>wearing to the woman in gratification. King Negrls rep- <br>resented the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the <br>Nikah ceremony, and gave her 400 dinars as her portion <br>and many other things in dowry from himself. He also gave <br>a feast and dinars as gift to all those who were present in <br>the ceremony. The Negus then despatched her to Madinah <br>with her dowry and other gifts such as perfume, etc. This <br>marriage took place in 7 A. H. (Her father was not a Muslim <br>then). She most probably died in 44 A. H. <br>(10) Hadhrat Safiyyah (Kadhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Hayi, who was a descendant <br>of Hadhrat Harun (Alaihis salaam) the brother of Hadhrat <br>Moosa (Alaihis salaam). She was first married to Salam bin <br>Mishkam and then to Kinanah bin Abi Huqaiq at the time <br>of Kheybar. Kinanah was killed in the battle and she was <br>captured by the Muslims. Hadhrat Dahya Kalbi (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) requested for a maid, and the Prophet made her <br>over to him. At this, the other Sahabah approached the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Banu Nazir and Banu Quraizah <br>(the Jewish tribes of Madinah) will feel offended to see <br>the daughter of a Jewish chief working as a maid. We <br>therefore suggest that she may be taken as your own <br>wife.\" <br>I <br>The Prophet paid a reasonable sum of money to Hadhrat <br>Dahya (Radhiyallaho anho) as ransom, and said to Sa-<br>fiyyah: <br>\"You are now free: if you like you can go back to your <br>tribe or can be my wife.\" <br>She said: \t \"I longed to be with you while I was a Jew. How <br>can I leave you now, when I am a Muslim?\" <br>This is probably a reference to the fact that she once saw in <br>-her dream a portion of the moon falling into her lap. When <br>she mentioned her dream to Kinanah, he smote her face. so <br>severely that she developed a mark on her eye. He said:</p></div>"

X: Women's Courage 6.Spirit for Islam <br>\"You seem to be desiring to become the wife of the <br>King of Madinah.\" <br>Her father is also reported to have treated her similarly <br>when she related the same or similar dream to him. She <br>again saw (in her dream) the sun lying on her breast. When <br>she mentioned this to her husband, he remarked: <br>\"You seem to be wishing to become the Queen of Mad- <br>inah.\" <br>She says: \t \"I was seventeen when I was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>She came to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) when he was camping at the first stage from <br>Khaiber. Next morning, he said to the Sahabah: <br>\"Let everybody bring whatever he has got to eat.'' <br>They brought their own dates, cheese, butter, etc. A long <br>leather sheet was spread and all sat round it to share the <br>food among themselves. This was the Walimah for the mar- <br>riage. <br>She died in Ramadhan, 50 A. H., when she was about <br>60. <br>(II )  Hadhrat Maimoonah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Harith bin Hazan. Her original <br>name was Barrah, but she was later renamed Maimoonah <br>by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She was first <br>married to Abu Rahm bin Abdul Uzza. According to some <br>reports, she was married twice before she became Ummul <br>Mominin. She had been widowed lately when the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her at Saraf, a place <br>lying on his journey to Mecca for 'Umrah in Zul Qa'dah 7 <br>A. H. He had intended to start living with her when in <br>Mecca after performing 'Umrah but, as Qureysh did not <br>allow him to enter Mecca, he called her over to him in the <br>same place on his return journey. Many years later she died <br>and was buried exactly at the same place in 51 A. H. (when <br>she was 81). This is a strange coincidence that at a certain <br>place during one journey she is married, at the same place <br>on the return journey she starts living with the Prophet. <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and at the very place during <br>another journey she dies and is buried. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (RAdhiyallaho anha) savs: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Maimoonah was the most pious, and the most mind- <br>ful of her kith and kin, among the Prophet's wives.\" <br>Hadhrat Yazid bin Asam (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"She was seen either engaged in Salat or in domestic <br>work. When she was doing neither, she was busy in <br>Miswak.\" <br>She was the last woman to be married by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Certain Muhaddithin have, how- <br>ever, mentioned one or two other marriages contracted by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Appendix: <br>The Sons of The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had three <br>sons and four daughters. All the children were born from <br>Hadhrat Khadija (Radhivallaho anha), except the son Ibra- <br>him. Qasim was his first son, born to him before Nubuw- <br>wat. He died when he was two. Abdullah, the second son, <br>was born after Nubuwwat. He was, hence, called Tayyab <br>and Taahir. He also died in his childhood. At the time of <br>his death, the Qureysh rejoiced and said: <br>\"Muhammad is without a son, and will therefore be <br>without posterity. His name will also die out with his <br>death.\" <br>It was on this occasion that Soorah Al-Kauthar was re-<br>vealed by Allah. It said: <br>\"Lo! We have given thee Abundance. So pray unto thy <br>Lord, and sacrifice. Lo! it is thy detractor (not thou) <br>(XVIII:1to 3)<br>who is without posterity.\" <br>Even after more than thirteen hundred years, tci :v there <br>are millions who are proud to be connected to him in love <br>and devotion. <br>Ibrahim, the third son and last child, was born in Mad- <br>inah in 8 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) <br>wonla11 slave Mariah begot this for him. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) performed the Aqiqah ceremorly <br><br>Ch. X: Women's C o u ~ g e  <br>b Spirit for Islam <br>on the seventh day of his birth. Two lambs were slaugh- <br>tered, the child's head was shaved by Hadhrat Abu Hind <br>Bayazi (Radhiyallaho anho), silver equal in weight to his <br>hair was spent in charity, and the hair was buried. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I am naming my child after the name of my forefather <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam).\" <br>This son also died, on 10th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, 10 A. Ii., <br>when he was only 18 months old. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) then remarked: <br>\"Allah has appointed a heavenly nurse to tend to Ibra- <br>hirn in the gardens of Paradise.\" <br>The Daughters of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>(1)Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the eldest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and was born in the fifth year of his first <br>marriage, when he was thirty. She embraced Islam and was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. The story of her <br>emigration to Madinah and her getting wounded by the Qu- <br>reysh has already been given in the early part of this chap- <br>ter. She suffered long from that wound, and at last died of <br>it in the beginning of 8 A. H. Her husband also embraced <br>Islam later and joined her in Madinah. She had a son Ali <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). and a daughter Amamah. Ali died <br>during the life time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). This same Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) was the person <br>who sat with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on <br>the camel's back at the time of his triumphal entry into <br>Mecca. We read frequently in Hadith about a little girl <br>riding on the back of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) as he prostrated in Salaat; this was Amamah, Zainab's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) daughter. She lived long after the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) married her on the death of Fatima (Rad- <br>hivallaho anha)-his first wife. It is said that Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) at the time of her death had expressed <br>a desire for this union. She had no issue from Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho). After Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>death she was again married to Hadhrat Mughirah bin <br>Naufal (Radhiyallaho anho), from whom she probably got <br>one son named Yahya. She died in 50 A. H.</p></div>"

She was married to Utbah, son of <br>Abu Lahab, the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>uncle, but had not yet started living with him when Soorah <br>Al-Lahab was revealed. Abu Lahab called his sons Utbah <br>and Utaibah (to whom Umme Kulsum, another daughter of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam) was married), <br>and said to them: <br>\"Unless you both divorce the daughters of Muham-<br>mad, I am not going to see your faces.\" <br>They divorced their wives. Later, upon the fall of Mecca, <br>Utbah embraced Islam. Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) after this divorce was married to Hadhrat 'Usman <br>(Radhivallaho anho). The couple emigrated to Abyssinia <br>twice. as we have already seen in chapter I. <br>Since the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had an- <br>nounced to the Sahabah that he was expecting to receive <br>Allah's command for emigration to Madinah any time, they <br>started shifting to Madinah even before the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallahoalaihe wassallam) Hijrat. Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyal- <br>Laho anho) and Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) had <br>also emigrated to Madinah before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) arrived in the town. At the time of Badr, <br>Ruqa!lvah was ill (she died subsequently of this illness). <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was, therefore, asked by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to stay in Madinah <br>and look after her. The news about the victory in Badr was <br>received in Madinah when people were returning from Ru- <br>qayyah's funeral. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was, therefore, not present at her burial. <br>A son was born to Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) in Abvssinia. He was named Abdullah and survived <br>his mother. but died in 4 A. H. when he was six years old. <br>(3)Hadhrat U~nme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She is the third daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). She was married to Utaibah son of Abu <br>Lahab, but had not yet started living with him when Utai- <br>bah divorced her after the revelation of Soorah Al-Lahab, as <br>has already been mentioned. After divorcing her, Utaibah <br><br>Ch. X:Women's Courage 6.Spirit for Islam <br>213 g4 <br>$.p <br>came to the Prophet (~allall'aho alaihe wasallam) and used <br>most insolent words to him. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe $4 <br>g m<br>wasallam) cursed him by praying: <br>\"0, Allah! depute one of Thy dogs to punish him.\" <br>Abu Talib, who had also not embraced Islam, was alarmed <br>at the curse and said to Utaibah: <br>\"YOU have no way out now.\" <br>Once Utaibah was accompanying Abu Lahab in a caravan <br>going to Syria. Abu Lahab; in spite of his disbelief, said to <br>the people: <br>\"I am afraid of Muhammad's curse. Everybody should <br>be very careful of my son.\" <br>They happened to camp at a place which was inhabited by <br>lions. The people piled up all their luggage and Utaibah <br>was made to sleep on top of the pile, while the rest of the <br>people slept around the pile. A lion came at night; it smelt <br>all the people sleeping round the pile. Then it jumped over <br>the people and reached Utaibah. He gave out a shriek, but <br>meanwhile the lion had severed his head from his body. It <br>is very necessary that we avoid, offending the eople dear <br>to Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal am) has re- <br>P <br>ported Allah as saying: <br>\"I give a challenge of war to one who offends My <br>friends.\" <br>After the death of Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiallaho <br>anha), Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>also married to Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>Rabi-ul-Awwal, 3 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said: <br>\"I have given Umme Kulsum in marriage to Usman by <br>Allah's command.\" <br>She died issueless in Shaaban, 9 A. H. After herdeath, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have re- <br>marked: <br>\"Even if I had one hundred daughters, I would have <br>given all of them in marriage to 'Usman (one after the <br>other), if each one had died.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(4)Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) the fourth and <br>the youngest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), and the \"head of the ladies in Paradise\" was born <br>in the 1st year of Nubuwwat, when he was 41. It is said <br>that the name Fatimah (lit: safe from fire) was revealed by <br>Allah. She was married to Ali (Radhiyallaho,anho) in 2 A. <br>H. and she began to live with him seven and a half months <br>later. She was about fifteen and Ali was 21 at the time of <br>their union. Of all the daughters, she was the most loved by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); whenever he <br>went out on a journey, she was the last one to part with <br>and when he returned home she was the first one to meet <br>him. When Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) intended to marry Abu <br>Jahal's daughter, she was very much grieved and expressed <br>her grief to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Fatimah is a part of my body. Whoever grieves her, <br>grieves me. \" <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) gave up the idea of the second <br>marriage during her life time. After her death, he married <br>her niece Amamah (Radhiyallaho anha), as we have <br>already seen in the previous pages. <br>It was about six months after the death of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that Fatimah fell ill. One day, <br>she said to her maid: <br>\"I want to takep bath. Arrange some water for me.\" <br>She took a bath and changed her clothes. She then desired <br>her bed to be placed in the middle of the room. She laid <br>herself down on the bedding, with her face towards Qiblah, <br>and her right hand under her right cheek, and said: <br>\"I am now going to die.\" <br>The next moment she was no more. The Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) progeny continued and shall con- <br>tinue (inshallah) through her children. She had three sons <br>and three daughters. Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hus- <br>sain (Radhiyallaho anho) were born in the second and the <br>third year after the marriage, respectively. Muhassan (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the third son, was born in 4 A. H.,.but <br>died in childhood. <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6.Spirit for lslam <br>Ruqayyah, her first daughter, died in infancy and has, <br>therefore, not been mentioned much in history. Her second <br>daughter Umme Kulsum was first married to Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), begetting one son Zaid and one <br>daughter Hadhrat Ruqayyah. On Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho's) death, Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho <br>anhaj was married to Aun bin Ja'far, but had no issue from <br>him. After his death, his brother Muhammad bin Ja'far mar- <br>ried her. A daughter was born to them, who died in child- <br>hood Even Muhammad (Radhiyallaho anho) died in her <br>lifetime and she was again married to the third brother, <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho), from whom she <br>had no issue. She died as Abdullah's wife. Her son Zaid <br>also died the same day, and both were carried for burial at <br>the same time. Abdullah, 'Aun and Muhammad (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum) have already been mentioned as sons of Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and nephews of Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in chapter VI. <br>Zainab, Hadhrat Fatima's (Radhiyallaho anha) third <br>daughter, was married to Abdullah bin Ja'far and had two <br>sons Abdullah and Aun from him. It was after her death <br>that he married her sister Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>many other children from his wives after Fatimah. It is <br>stated that he had as many as thirty-two issues. Hasan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had fifteen sons and eight daughters, <br>while Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was the father of six <br>sons and three daughters. <br><br>CHAPTER XI <br>THE CHILDREN-THEIR DEVOTION TO ISLAM <br>The true spirit of Islam that we find in the children of <br>Sahabah's time was the fruit of the upbringing which they <br>received at the hands of their parents. The parents and <br>guardians of our times spoil the children by over fondling <br>them. If, instead, they inculcated in their young hearts the <br>importance of Islamic practices, these could easily become <br>their habits when they grow up. When we see a child doing <br>something undesirable, we simply brush it off by saying, <br>'He is but a child.' We have seen some parents even feeling <br>happy over their darling (child) having sufficient grown up <br>to do such unseemly things. We deceive ourselves when <br>we say, on seeing a child doing something un-Islamic, that <br>he will be all right when he grows up. <br>How can a bad seed grow up into a good plant? If you <br>really wish your child to be a good Muslim when he is <br>grown up, you have to sow the seed of Iman and Islam in <br>his heart right from his childhood. The Sahabah were very <br>particular about training their children in Islamic practices. <br>and they kept a watchful eye on their doings. <br>In Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) time, a person <br>was arrested by the police for drinking in Ramadhan. When <br>he was brought before Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>he said to him: <br>t <br>\"Woe to you! Even our children are keeping fast in this <br>month.\" <br>He was punished with eighty lashes and was banished <br>from Madinah for ever. <br>1. \t Children keep fast. <br>Hadhrat Rubbayi' bint Mu'awwaz (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>(who was mentioned in the last chapter) says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined on us to fast on the 10th of Muharram. Since <br>then we have always been fasting on that day. Even the <br>children were made to fast with us. When they cried</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>212 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(2)Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was born three years after the birth of Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha), when the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was 33. She was married to Utbah, son of <br>Abu Lahab, the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>uncle, but had not yet started living with him when Soorah <br>Al-Lahab was revealed. Abu Lahab called his sons Utbah <br>and Utaibah (to whom Umme Kulsum, another daughter of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam) was married), <br>and said to them: <br>\"Unless you both divorce the daughters of Muham-<br>mad, I am not going to see your faces.\" <br>They divorced their wives. Later, upon the fall of Mecca, <br>Utbah embraced Islam. Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) after this divorce was married to Hadhrat 'Usman <br>(Radhivallaho anho). The couple emigrated to Abyssinia <br>twice. as we have already seen in chapter I. <br>Since the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had an- <br>nounced to the Sahabah that he was expecting to receive <br>Allah's command for emigration to Madinah any time, they <br>started shifting to Madinah even before the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallahoalaihe wassallam) Hijrat. Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyal- <br>Laho anho) and Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) had <br>also emigrated to Madinah before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) arrived in the town. At the time of Badr, <br>Ruqa!lvah was ill (she died subsequently of this illness). <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was, therefore, asked by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to stay in Madinah <br>and look after her. The news about the victory in Badr was <br>received in Madinah when people were returning from Ru- <br>qayyah's funeral. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was, therefore, not present at her burial. <br>A son was born to Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) in Abvssinia. He was named Abdullah and survived <br>his mother. but died in 4 A. H. when he was six years old. <br>(3)Hadhrat U~nme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She is the third daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). She was married to Utaibah son of Abu <br>Lahab, but had not yet started living with him when Utai- <br>bah divorced her after the revelation of Soorah Al-Lahab, as <br>has already been mentioned. After divorcing her, Utaibah <br><br>Ch. X:Women's Courage 6.Spirit for Islam <br>213 g4 <br>$.p <br>came to the Prophet (~allall'aho alaihe wasallam) and used <br>most insolent words to him. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe $4 <br>g m<br>wasallam) cursed him by praying: <br>\"0, Allah! depute one of Thy dogs to punish him.\" <br>Abu Talib, who had also not embraced Islam, was alarmed <br>at the curse and said to Utaibah: <br>\"YOU have no way out now.\" <br>Once Utaibah was accompanying Abu Lahab in a caravan <br>going to Syria. Abu Lahab; in spite of his disbelief, said to <br>the people: <br>\"I am afraid of Muhammad's curse. Everybody should <br>be very careful of my son.\" <br>They happened to camp at a place which was inhabited by <br>lions. The people piled up all their luggage and Utaibah <br>was made to sleep on top of the pile, while the rest of the <br>people slept around the pile. A lion came at night; it smelt <br>all the people sleeping round the pile. Then it jumped over <br>the people and reached Utaibah. He gave out a shriek, but <br>meanwhile the lion had severed his head from his body. It <br>is very necessary that we avoid, offending the eople dear <br>to Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal am) has re- <br>P <br>ported Allah as saying: <br>\"I give a challenge of war to one who offends My <br>friends.\" <br>After the death of Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiallaho <br>anha), Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>also married to Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>Rabi-ul-Awwal, 3 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said: <br>\"I have given Umme Kulsum in marriage to Usman by <br>Allah's command.\" <br>She died issueless in Shaaban, 9 A. H. After herdeath, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have re- <br>marked: <br>\"Even if I had one hundred daughters, I would have <br>given all of them in marriage to 'Usman (one after the <br>other), if each one had died.\"</p></div>"

It is said <br>that the name Fatimah (lit: safe from fire) was revealed by <br>Allah. She was married to Ali (Radhiyallaho,anho) in 2 A. <br>H. and she began to live with him seven and a half months <br>later. She was about fifteen and Ali was 21 at the time of <br>their union. Of all the daughters, she was the most loved by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); whenever he <br>went out on a journey, she was the last one to part with <br>and when he returned home she was the first one to meet <br>him. When Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) intended to marry Abu <br>Jahal's daughter, she was very much grieved and expressed <br>her grief to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Fatimah is a part of my body. Whoever grieves her, <br>grieves me. \" <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) gave up the idea of the second <br>marriage during her life time. After her death, he married <br>her niece Amamah (Radhiyallaho anha), as we have <br>already seen in the previous pages. <br>It was about six months after the death of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that Fatimah fell ill. One day, <br>she said to her maid: <br>\"I want to takep bath. Arrange some water for me.\" <br>She took a bath and changed her clothes. She then desired <br>her bed to be placed in the middle of the room. She laid <br>herself down on the bedding, with her face towards Qiblah, <br>and her right hand under her right cheek, and said: <br>\"I am now going to die.\" <br>The next moment she was no more. The Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) progeny continued and shall con- <br>tinue (inshallah) through her children. She had three sons <br>and three daughters. Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hus- <br>sain (Radhiyallaho anho) were born in the second and the <br>third year after the marriage, respectively. Muhassan (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the third son, was born in 4 A. H.,.but <br>died in childhood.</p></div>"

The main idea underlying <br>this behest was that Muslim mothers, while going to bed at <br>night, instead of telling myths and fables to their children, <br>may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden <br>age of Islam that would create in them an Islamic spirit of <br>love and esteem for Sahabah, and thereby improve their <br>'Imaan'; and the proposed book may, thus, be a useful sub- <br>stitute for the currenttstory books. It became essential for <br>me to comply with tKe desire of the Sheikh, for, besides <br>being under moral debt and obligation to him for his im- <br>mense beneficence, I consider the goodwill of such godly <br>people to be the source of success in this world and the <br>Hereafter. I knew my shortcomings and difficulties and, <br>therefore, had been postponing the execution of this work <br>for four years, when in Safar 1357 A.H., it so happened that <br>I was advised by the doctors to suspend my regular duty of <br>teaching for some time. I decided to utilize this period of <br>rest for complying with the long-standing desire of the <br>Sheikh, with the belief that even if my attempt did not <br>come up to his expectation, it would any\\ow be a pleasant <br>engagement for me and one likely to bring me spiritual <br>blessings, in addition. <br><br>0,<br>-5% <br>FOREWORD <br>as <br>rn ar<br>-5I <br>It is an admitted fact that the stories of the godly s* <br>people deserve to be studied rather deeply, in order to <br>derive proper benefit from them. This is more important in <br>case of Sahabah, who were chosen by Allah for the com- <br>pany of His beloved and our dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Their stories not only serve as a beacon <br>of Faith and Practice but also cause Allah's blessings and <br>mercy to descend on the readers. Junaid Baghdadi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), a head of the Sufees, once said: <br>\"Stories of the pious and godly are Allah's special de- <br>vices, which encourage the hearts of those who strive <br>in His Path.\" <br>Somebody inquired of Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) if he <br>could cite something in support of his statement. He re- <br>plied: <br>\"Yes. Allah has said in His Book-<br>\"And all that we relate unto thee of the stories of the <br>messengers is in order that thereby We may make the <br>heart firm. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth <br>and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.\" <br>(XI: 120) <br>One cannot lay too much stress on the point that <br>whether these be the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) or the stories of other God-fearing <br>people, or the books on Islamic practices, or the epistles <br>and written discourses of the saints, it is not enough to go <br>through them once only, but they have to be studied over <br>and over again in order to derive proper benefit from them. <br>Abu Sulaiman Darani (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous Sairlt, <br>writes: <br>\"I attended a discourse by a Sheikh at his residence. It <br>had some effect on me, but only till the time that I rose <br>from the meeting. I went to his audience for the second <br>time to listen to his discourse, and this time the effect <br>remained with me till I reached my home. When I vis-<br>ited him for the third time, the effect of his discourse <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>stayed with me even after reaching home. Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br><br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br><br>17 / <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br><br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>son with the Muslims even at the personal request of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and would have for- <br>gone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br><br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>25 3<br>b, =a <br>The next day. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>peated his perilous confession of Imaan and would have <br>3, <br>surely been beaten to death by the crowd, had not Abbas <br>intervened once again and saved him for the second time. <br>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>due to his extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah <br>among the disbelievers, and the prohibition by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was due to the soft corner in his <br>heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho), lest he be put <br>to hardships that might prove too much for him. There is not <br>the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. Since the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was under-<br>going all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Is- <br>lam, Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow <br>his example rather than to avail of his permission to avoid <br>danger. It was this spirit of Sahabah that took them to the <br>heights of material and spiritual progress. When a person <br>once recited the Kalimah and entered the fold of Islam, no <br>power on earth could turn him back and no oppression or <br>tyranny could stop him from Tabligh. <br>6. \t<br>The AMictions of Hadhrat Khabbab bin Alarat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Kadhiyallaho anho) is also one of <br>those blessed persons who offered themselves for sacrifice <br>and suffering for the cause of Allah. He was the sixth or se- <br>venth person to embrace Islam and, therefore, he suffered <br>long. He was made to put on steel armour and lie in the <br>sun to sweat and swelter. Very often he was made to lie flat <br>on burning sand. which caused the flesh on his back to <br>waste away. He was the slave of a woman. When she came <br>to know that he was visiting the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), she used to brand his head with a hot iron rod. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his caliphate <br>once inquired of him about the details of his sufferings <br>after embracing Islam. He showed him his back, seeing <br>which Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"I <br>have never seen such a back before.\" He said, \"My body <br>was dragged over heaps of smouldering charcoal, and the <br>blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire.\" It is <br>said that, when Islam spread and the hluslims conquered <br>all the surrounding territory, he used to weep and say: <br>\"Allah seems to he compensating us in this world for <br>all our sufferings, and perhaps nothing would be left <br>for us as reward in the Hereafter.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once per-<br>formed an unusually long rakaat while leading a Sa- <br>laat. When the Sahabah mentioned it to him, he said, <br>\"This was a Salaat of yearning and humility. I asked <br>three boons from Allah. I besought Him: <br>'0,Allah! Let not my Ummat perish by famine; let not <br>my Ummat be annihilated by an enemy gaining an <br>upper hand on them; and let not my Ummat fight <br>among themselves.' <br>Allah granted the first two prayers, but not the third <br>one.\" <br>Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) died in 37 A.H. <br>He was the first of the Sahabah to be buried at Koofah. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once passing his grave <br>said: <br>\"May Allah bless and show mercy on Hadhrat Khab- <br>bab (Radhiyallaho anho). He embraced Islam willingly. <br>He emigrated with great pleasure in Allah's path, and <br>spent his whole life in striving and suffering for Islam. <br>Blessed is the person who is mindful of the Day of <br>judgement, prepares for his reckoning, remains con-<br>tented with very little of this world, and is able to <br>please his Lord.\" <br>To be able to please Allah, was really, the Sahabah's <br>greatest achievement, for this was the sole purpose of their <br>life. <br>I <br>7. \t Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and His Par- <br>ents: <br>Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his parents <br>were also subjected to the severest afflictions. They were <br>tormented on the scorching sands of Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while passing oy them would <br>enjoin patience giving them glad tidings about paradise. <br>Ammaar's father Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) died after pro- <br>longed sufferings at the hands of persecutors, and his <br>mother Sumayya (Radhiyallaho anha) was killed by Abu <br>Jahl, who put his spear through the most private part of her <br>body, causing her death. She had refused to renounce Islam <br>in the face of terrible torture in her old age. The blessed <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>;%2 <br>lady was the first to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. ;% <br>The first mosque in Islam was built by Ammaar (Radhiyal- 3 2 <br>m<br>laho anho). <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) emi- <br>grated to Madinah, Ammaar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered to <br>build a structure for him where he could sit, take rest in the <br>afternoon, and say his Salaat under its roof. He first col- <br>lected the stones and then built the musjid in Quba. He <br>fought against the enemies of Islam with great zeal and <br>courage. Once he was fighting in a battle when he said re- <br>joicingly: <br>\"I am to meet my friends very soon, I am to meet <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his com- <br>panions.\" <br>He then asked for water. He was offered some milk. He <br>took it and said: <br>\"I heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say- <br>ing to me, \"Milk shall be the last drink of your worldly <br>life.\" <br>He then fought till he met his coveted end. He was <br>then aged about ninety-four. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Sohaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is- <br>Iam: <br>Hadhrat Sohaib and Hadhrat Ammaar (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) became Muslims at the same time. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying at Arqam's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) place, when they both came separately <br>with the same intention of embracing Islam and met each <br>other at the door of the house. Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also suffered very much at the hands of his persecutors, <br>like other poor Muslims of that time. At last he decided to <br>emigrate to Madinah. The Qureysh would not tolerate this <br>and, soon after his departure, a party went in pursuit to <br>bring him back to Mecca. As the party drew near, he <br>shouted to them: <br>\"You know that I am a better archer than all of you. So <br>long as I have a single arrow left with me, you will not <br>be able to approach me and, when I finish all my <br>arrows, I shall fight you with my sword, as long as it is <br>in my hand. If you like you can get my money which I <br>have left in Mecca and my two women slaves, in lieu <br>of me.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>And they agreed. He told them the whereabouts of his <br>money, and they allowed him to proceed to Madinah. At <br>this, Allah revealed the following verse of the Qur'an to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seek- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and Allah has compassion <br>on His bondsmen.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was at that time <br>at Quba. When he saw Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>coming, he remarked: <br>\"A good bargain, Sohaib!\" <br>Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was eating <br>dates at that time. I also joined him in eating. One of <br>my eyes was sore.\" He said, \"Sohaib! you are taking <br>dates when your eye is sore.\" 'But I am taking them by <br>the side of the other eye, which is not sore, 0,Prophet <br>of Allah,' I replied. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was much amused with my retort.\" <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was very gener- <br>ous and he spent his money on others most lavishly. 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once told him that he was rather ex- <br>travagant. He replied: <br>\"But I spend only where it is right.\" <br>When Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>die, he expressed the wish that his funeral service be led by <br>Hadhrat Sohaib (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) coming into Is-<br>lam. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), of whom all the <br>Muslims are justly proud, and the disbelievers still dread, <br>was most adamant in opposing the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and very prominent in persecuting the <br>Muslims before he embraced Islam. One day, the Qureysh <br>in a meeting called for somebody to volunteer himself for <br>the assassination of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>lam). 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) offered himself for this <br>job, at which everybody exclaimed: <br>\"Surely, you can do it, 'Umar!\" <br>With sword hanging from his neck, he set out straight away <br>on his sinister errand. On his way he met Sa'ad bin Abi <br>Waqqas of the Zuhrah clan. Sa'ad inquired: <br>\"Whither! 'Umar?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"I am after finishing Muhammad.\" <br>Sa'ad: \t<br>\"But do not you see that Banu Hashim, Banu <br>Zuhrah and Banu Abde Munaf are likely to kill <br>you in retaliation?\" <br>'Umar (upset at the warning): <br>\"It seems-that you also have renounced the religion of <br>your forefathers. Let me settle with you first.\" <br>So saying, Umar drew out his sword. Sa'ad announcing his <br>Islam, also took out his sword. They were about to start a <br>duel when Sa'ad said: <br>\"You had better first set your own house in order. <br>Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted <br>Islam.\" <br>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his <br>steps towards his sister's house. The door of the house was <br>bolted from inside and both husband and wife were <br>receiving lessons in the Qur'an from Hadhrat Khabbab <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door and <br>shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in <br>some inner room, forgetting to take the manuscript pages of <br>the Holy Qur'an with him. When the sister opened the <br>door, 'Umar hit her on the head, saying: <br>\"0,enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your <br>religion.\" <br>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, <br>\"What were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard <br>from outside?\" His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talk- <br>ing to each other.\" 'Umar said to him, \"Have you also for- <br>saken the creed of your forefathers and gone over to the <br>new religion?\" The brother-in-law replied, \"But what if the <br>new religion be the better and the true one'?\" 'Umar got <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>beside himself with rage and fell on him, pulling his beard <br>and beating him most savagely. When the sister intervened, <br>he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most <br>profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out: <br>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become <br>Muslims. Listen! we are determined to die as Muslims. <br>You are free to do whatever you like.\" <br>When 'Umar had cooled down and felt a bit ashamed over <br>his sister's bleeding, his eyes fell on the pages of the Qur'an <br>left behind by Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). He <br>said, \"Alright show me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the <br>sister. \"vou are unclean and no unclean person can touch <br>the Scripture.\" He insisted, but the sister was not prepared <br>to allow him to touch the leaves unless he washed his <br>body. 'Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then <br>began to read the leaves. It was Surah \"Taha\". He started <br>from the beginning of the Surah, and he1 was a changed <br>man altogether when he came to the verse: <br>\"Lo! I, indeed I am Alfah. There is none worthy of <br>worship savz Me. So serve me and establish Salaat for <br>My remembrance.\" <br>He said: \"Alright, take me to Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br>On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came out from insidwand said: <br>\"0,'Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday (on Thurs- <br>day night) the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>prayed to Allah, '0,Allah strengthen Islam with either <br>'Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest'. It seems <br>that his prayer has been answered in your favour.\" <br>'Umar then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and embraced Islam on Friday morning. 'Umar's Islam <br>was a terrible blow to the morale of the unbelievers, but <br>still the Muslims were few in number and the whole coun- <br>try was against them. The disbelievers intensified ,their <br>efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims and the <br>extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on <br>their side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in <br><br>the Haram. Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>'\"Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration to <br>Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his acces- <br>sion to the Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\" <br>10. The Flight to Abyssinia and Ostracism in the Gorge of <br>Ibn-Abi Talib: <br>The hardships and sufferings borne by the Muslims <br>were ever on the increase. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) at last permitted them to emigrate to some other <br>place. Abyssinia at that time was ruled by a Christian King <br>(who later on embraced Islam). famous for his mercy and <br>equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, the ,first <br>group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about <br>twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to <br>the port to capture them, but their vessels had left the <br>shore. When the group reached Abyssinia, they heard the <br>rumour that the whole tribe of the Qureysh had accepted <br>Islam. They were naturally very much pleased at the new, <br>and returned to their country. On approaching Mecca, they <br>learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions wen: <br>going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to <br>Abyssinia and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protec- <br>tion of a few inflyential people. This is known as the first <br>migration to Abyssinia. Later on, a bigger group of eighty- <br>three men and eighteen women emigrated to Abyssinia <br>(separately). This is called the second emigration to that <br>country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. <br>The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought <br>of peace enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They <br>sent a delegation to Abyssinia with handsome presents for <br>the king, his courtiers and the clergy. The delegation first <br>met the chiefs and the priests and, by offering them pres- <br>ents, succeeded in winning the court officials to their side. <br>Having thus made their way to the royal court, they pros- <br>trated themselves before the king and then presenting the <br>gifts put their case before him. They &id: <br>\"0,king! A few foolish lads of our community have re- <br>nounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an <br>absolutely new religion, which is opposed to'our as <br>well as your religions. They have come and-settled in <br>your country. The nobility of Mecca, their own parents <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and kith and kin have sent us to take them back to <br>their country. We beseech you to make them over to <br>us.\" <br>The king replied: <br>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought <br>our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call <br>them to our presence, and hear them out. If your <br>charge of apostasy against them is genuine, we shall <br>make them over to you.\" <br>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. <br>They were at first greatly distressed and did not know what <br>to do, but Allah gave them courage, and they decided to go <br>and place the true facts before the king. On appearing <br>before him, they greeted him with 'Salaam'. Someone from <br>the courtiers objected that they had not prostrated before <br>the king according to the rules of the land. They explained: <br>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbid- <br>den us from prostrating before any one except Allah.\" <br>The king then asked them to submit what defence they <br>could make to the charges brought against them. Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) rose and addressed the king thus: <br>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither <br>knew Allah nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped <br>stones. We used to eat carrion and commit all sorts of <br>undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did not make <br>good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among <br>us would thrive,at the expense of the weak. Till at last, <br>Allah raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>our reformation. His noble descent, up-right conduct, <br>integrity of purpose, and pure life are only too well <br>known amongst us. He called upon us to worship Al- <br>lah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone- <br>worship. He enjoined upon us right conduct, and for- <br>bade us from indecency. He taught us to tell the truth, <br>to make good our trust, to have regard for our kith and <br>kin, and to do good to our neighbours. From him we <br>learnt to observe Salaat. Fasting, Zakaat and good con- <br>duct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid blood- <br>shed. He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, <br>misappropriating the orphan's heritage, bringing false <br>accusations against others, and all other indecent <br>things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, the won- <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>derful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed <br>him and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our <br>people began to persecute us, and to subject us to tor- <br>tures, thinking that we might abjure our faith and re- <br>vert ta idolatry. When, however, their cruelties <br>exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country <br>by the permission of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam).\" <br>The king said: <br>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\" <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses <br>from the beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the <br>hearts of the king and the priestly class so much that tears <br>flowed down their cheeks and wetted their beards. The <br>king remarked: <br>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to <br>Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the <br>same light,\" <br>and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no <br>means hand over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed <br>and disgraced, they held a counsel. One of them said: <br>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's <br>wrath upon their heads.\" <br>Although the others did not agree to sukh a drastic step (for <br>after all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would <br>not listen. The next day, they excited the king by telling <br>him that those heretics denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) <br>and did not believe in his Divinity. The Muslims were <br>again summoned to the court. They were much more dis- <br>tressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief <br>in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam). they said: <br>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him to <br>our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a <br>servant and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which <br>He conveyed to the virgin and pure Maryam.\" <br>Negus said: \"'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does :not say <br>anything beyond that.\" <br>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king <br>would not listen to them. He returned to the de1t:gatioil the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>presents they had brought f.or him, and said to the Mus- <br>lims: <br>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will <br>have to pay heavily for it.\" <br>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This <br>enhanced the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and <br>the Qureysh delegation had to return crestfallen. <br>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and <br>the triumph of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the <br>exasperation of the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to Islam added fuel to fire. They grew more <br>and more embittered, till things came to such a pass that a <br>large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired to kill Mu- <br>hammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal <br>summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. <br>Banu Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) belonged, were strong in number and still <br>stronger in influence. Although all of them were not Mus- <br>lims, yet even the non-Muslims among them would not <br>agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place <br>a social ban on the Banu Hashim, and their chiefs drew up <br>a document to the effect that none of them or their clans <br>would associate with, buy from or sell to those who sided <br>with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death pen- <br>alty. All of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of <br>7th year of the Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the <br>Ka'abah in order to give it full sanctity. Then, for three long <br>years. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was shut up <br>with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section of <br>one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long <br>years, nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. <br>They could not purchase anything in Mecca nor from any <br>trader coming from outside. If any person was found out- <br>side this natural prison, he was beaten mercilessly and if <br>he asked for anything it was flatly refused. Soon their stock <br>of food was exhausted and they were reduced to famine <br>rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and <br>suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder <br>on them than their own starvation. During the last part of <br>this period, their sole subsistence was the little food that <br>the husbands of Hashimite women married into other clans <br>managed td smuggle into the glen in the darkness of night. <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll <br>was eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The <br>severity of the afflictions, which they bore during this <br>period of ostracism, cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah <br>not only remained steadfast in their faith, but also kept <br>busy in spreading the light of Islam amongst their com- <br>rades in distress. <br>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the <br>path of Allah and for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow <br>their footsteps, and dream of the material progress and <br>spiritual elevation which was theirs, but how much have <br>we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice have we <br>offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always <br>proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury <br>and comfort, and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder <br>with the non-Muslims in enjoying the good things of this <br>world, forgetting the Hereafter, and then at the same time <br>we expect to receive the same help from Allah which the <br>Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile anybody <br>but ourselves by working like this. As the Poet has said, <br>'I am afraid, 0 wayfarer, that you will not reach the Ka'aba <br>because the path that you are following goes (in the oppo- <br>site direction) to Turkistan.' <br><br>FEAR OF ALLAH <br>Coupled with the remarkable spirit of sacrifice, the Sa-<br>habah had genuine and deep-rooted fear of Allah in their <br>hearts. I wish today's Muslims could have an iota of that <br>fear of Allah. Here are a few stories about this aspect of <br>their lives. <br>1. \t The Prophet's [Sallallahoalaihe wasallam) <br>Apprehensionsat the time of a storm. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that when-<br>ever a strong wind bringing dense clouds started blowing, <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) face turned pale <br>with the fear of Allah. He became restive and would go in <br>and out with perturbation, and would recite the following <br>prayer: <br>\"0,my Allah! I ask of Thee the good out of this wind, <br>the good out of that which is in this wind, and the <br>good out of that which is the outcome of this wind. I <br>seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this wind, from the <br>evil out of that which is in this wind, and from the evil <br>out of that which is the outcome of this wind.\" <br>She says: <br>\"And further when it began to rain, signs of delight ap-<br>peared on his face. I said to him once, '0,Prophet of <br>Allah when clouds appear everybody is happy as they <br>foretell rain, but why is it that I see you so much per-<br>turbed at that time?' He replied, '0,'Aishah! How can I <br>feel secure that this wind does not portend Allah's <br>wrath? The people of A'ad were punished with the <br>wind. They were happy when they beheld the gather-<br>ing dense clouds, believing that they brought rain; but <br>actually those clouds brought no rain but utter destruc-<br>tion to 'A'ad.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>4 <br>The Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. obviously 44  <br>referring to the following verses of the Qur'an: <br>S <br>Ln <br>\"Then, when they (A'ad) beheld a dense cloud coming <br>toward their valleys, they said: \"Here is a cloud bring-<br>ing us rain.\" Nay, but it is that very calamity which <br>you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is grievous <br>penalty, destroying all things by commandment of its <br>Lord. And morning found them so that naught could <br>be seen, save their dwellings. Thus we treat the guilty <br>folk.\" <br>(XLVI:24 & 25) <br>Look at the fear of Allah in the heart of a person who is <br>the best of all creation (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In spite <br>of a clear verse in the Qur'an that Allah would not punish <br>the people so long as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-<br>lam) was with them (Al-Qur'an VIII: 33), he has so much <br>fear of Allah in him that a strong wind reminds him of the <br>punishment awarded to the people in the past. Now let us <br>peep into our own hearts for a moment. Although we are <br>fully saturated with sins, yet none of the unusual phenom-<br>ena viz: earthquake, lightning, etc., arouses the least fear of <br>Allah in our hearts and, instead of resorting to Istighfaar or <br>Salaat at such times, we only indulge in absurd investiga-<br>tions. <br>2. \t<br>What Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) used to do <br>when a storm approached: <br>Hadhrat Nadhr-bin-Abdullah relates: <br>\"One day while Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was alive, it became very dark during the day time. I <br>went to him and said, \"Did you ever see much a thing <br>in the Prophet's time?\" He replied, \"I seek refuge in <br>Allah! In those days if the breeze grew a little stronger <br>than normal, we would hasten towards the musjid, <br>fearing the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Whenever there was a storm, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>alaihe wasallam) would get perturbed and would go to \t<br>the musjid.\" \t<br>Who thinks of going to musjid, now-a-days, even at the <br>time of the worst of calamities? Leave aside the common <br>people, even those who regard themselves as good and <br>practising Muslims do not practise this Sunnat. What a de- <br>terioration! <br>3. \t The action of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at <br>the Time of Solar Eclipse. <br>The Sun once was in eclipse in the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) time. The Sahabah left their jobs. <br>Even the young boys, practising archery, hastened towards <br>the musjid to know what the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) would do at that time. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasaliam) started Salaat of two rakaat, which were <br>so long that some people fainted and fell down. He wept in <br>his Salaat and said: <br>\"0,My Lord! Thou has said that Thou y~ouldst not <br>punish them as long as I am with them and so long as <br>they seek Thy forgiveness.\" <br>This refers tai. a verse in the Qur'an wherein Allah says: <br>\"But Allah would not punish them while Thou art <br>with them, nor will He punish them while they seek <br>forgiveness.\" <br>(VIII-33) <br>t <br>He then addressed the people saying: <br>\"You should hasten'for Salaat whenever you happen <br>to find the Sun or the Moon in eclipse. If you happen <br>to know the signs of the Last Day as I do. then surely <br>you would weep more and laugh less. In all such hap- <br>penings, repair to Salaat; pray to Allah and distribute <br>alms to the poor.\" <br>4. \t<br>The Prophet's weeping the whole night: <br>The Rophet once (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept <br>weeping the whole night through, repeating again and <br>again the following verse: <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>Br <br>CIo* <br>\"If Thou punish them, they art Thy slaves; and if Thou <br>forgive them, Thou only art the Mighty, the Wise.\" <br>(V:118) <br>.! <br>* <br>It is said about Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he also once wept the whole night, reciting the follow- <br>ing verse of the Qur'an in Tahajjud: <br>\"But avaunt ye, 0,ye guilty, this day.\" <br>(XXXVI:58) <br>This verse means that on the Day of Judgement, the guilty <br>will be asked to separate themselves from the good, and <br>will not be allowed to mix with them as they were doing in <br>the worldly life. Why should not the people with fear of <br>Allah in their hearts weep in anxiety regarding which class <br>they will belong to on that Day? <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and The Fear <br>of Allah: <br>According to our belief, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is the most exalted person after the Prophets (may peace be <br>on all of them). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself conveyed to him the glad tidings of his being the <br>head of a group of persons in Paradise. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once remarked: <br>\"Abu Bakr's name shall be called out from all the gates <br>of Paradise, and he will be the first of my followers to <br>enter it.\" <br>With all these virtues and privileges, Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) used to say: <br>\"I wish I were a tree that would be cut and done away <br>with.\" <br>Sometimes he would say: <br>\"I wish I were a blade of grass, whose life ended with <br>the grazing by some beast.\" <br>He also said: \"I wish I were a hair on the body of a <br>Mo'min.\" <br>Once he went to a garden, where he saw a bird singing. He <br>sighed deeply and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,bird! How lucky you are! You eat, you drink and <br>fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reck- <br>oning of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like <br>you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), during which he uttered a word that I did <br>not like. He realized it immediately and said to me <br>'Brother, please say that word back to me in retali- <br>ation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, and even spoke <br>of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word. He <br>got up and left me. A few people of my clan remarked, <br>'Look! How strange! The person does wrong to you <br>and, on the top of that, he threatens to complain to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)'. I said, 'Do you <br>b o w  who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>To displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and to displease the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to displease Allah, and <br>if Allah is displeased then who can save RabiAh from <br>ruin?' I went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and narrated the whole story to him. He said, <br>'You were quite right in refusing to utter that word. <br>But you could have said this much in reply: '0, Abu <br>Bakr, (Radhiyallaho anho) May Allah forgive you!\" <br>Look at the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho)! He is so anxious to clear his accounts in this <br>world that no sooner has a slightly unpleasant word been <br>addressed by him to a person, than he regrets it and re- <br>quests him to say that word back to him in retaliation. He <br>is so particular in this that he threatens to have the retaliat- <br>ion done through the intervention of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying <br>offensive words to others, but we fear neither the retaliat- <br>ion nor the reckoning in the Hereafter. <br>6. \t Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and the Fear of <br>Allah. <br>Umar (Iiadhiyallaho anho) would often hold a straw in <br>his hand and say: <br>\"I wish I were a straw like this.\" <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>41 2=% <br>o* <br>Sometimes he would say: \t<br>8: <br>-e a<br>3 m<br>\"I wish my mother had not given birth to me.\" <br>m <br>Once he was busy with some important work when a <br>person came to him and, complaining about some petty <br>grievance, requested for its redress. Hadhrat Umar (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) laid a lash across his shoulders, saying: <br>\"When I sit for that purpose, you do not come to me <br>but when I am engaged in other important work you <br>come with your grievances to interrupt me.\" <br>The person walked away. But Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) sent for him and, handing his whip over to him, <br>said: <br>\"You now lash me to even the matter.\" <br>He said: \"I forgive you for the sake of Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went home, prayed a <br>Salaat of two rakaats in repentance and upbraided himself <br>saying: <br>\"0,Umar! You were low but Allah elevated you. You <br>were wandering astray but Allah guided you. You were <br>base but Allah ennobled you and gave you sovereignty <br>over His people. Now one of them comes and asks you <br>for redress of the wrong done to him, and you beat <br>him? What answer have you to give before Allah?\" <br>He kept on chiding himself thus for a very long time. <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was going on <br>his usual round towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) <br>with his slave Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the <br>desert. He said: <br>\"There seems to be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan <br>that could not enter the town due to night fall. Let's go <br>and look after them and arrange for their protection <br>during the night.\" <br>When he reached there, he found a woman and some chil- <br>dren. The children were crying. The woman had a pan of <br>water over the fire. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went <br>near her. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Umar: <br>\"Why are these children crying?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Because they are hungry.\" <br>Umar: <br>\"What is in the pan?\" <br>The Woman: <br>\"Only water to soothe the children, so <br>that they may go to sleep in the belief <br>that food is being prepared for them. Ah! <br>Allah will judge between Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) and me, on the Day of <br>Judgement, for neglecting me in my dis- <br>tress.\" <br>'Umar (weeping): \"May Allah have mercy on you! How <br>can Umar know of your distress?\" <br>The Woman: \t<br>\"When he is our Amir, he must keep <br>himself informed about us.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>towd and straightway went to Baitul-Ma1 to fill a sack with <br>flour, dates, fat and clothes, and also drew some money. <br>When the sack was ready, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Now put this sack on my back, Aslam.\" <br>Aslam: \"No please, Amir-ul-Mo'mineen! I shall carry this <br>sack.\" <br>'Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistant re- <br>quests to allow him to carry the sack, and remarked: <br>\"What! Will you carry my load on the Day of Judge- <br>ment? I must carr this bag, for it is I who would be <br>questioned (in the l Iereafter) about this woman.\" <br>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) back, who carried it with a swift pace right to <br>the woman's tent. Aslam followed at his heels. He put a <br>little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and began to <br>stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it. <br>Aslam says: <br>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\" <br>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served <br>it to the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made <br>aver to them the little that was left for their next meal. The <br>children were very happy after their meal and began to <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>ae <br>% 3  <br>play about merrily. The woman felt very grateful and re- <br>8 3 <br>.E 4<br>marked: \t<br>S m  <br>m <br>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness! In fact you <br>deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\" <br>'Umar consoled her and said: <br>\"When you come to see the Khalifah, you will find me <br>there.\" <br>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching <br>the children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way <br>back, he said to Aslam: <br>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them <br>weeping in distress; I liked to, see them laughing and <br>happy for some time.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while <br>leading Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kahf', 'Taha' and other <br>such Soorahs in his Salaat, and would weep so much that <br>his crying could be heard way back to several rows. Once <br>he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf' in Fajr. When he came to the <br>verse: <br>\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" <br>(XII:86) <br>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In <br>Tahajjud, he would sometimes fall to the ground and <br>would get indis osed with excessive weeping. <br>Such was tEe fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) whose name struck terror in the hearts of the <br>mightiest monarchs of his time. Even today, the people are <br>filled with awe when they read about him. Is there any <br>person in power today who is prepared to show such kind- <br>ness to the people in his charge? <br>7. \t<br>An Admonition by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Wahab bin Munabbah says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) lost his eye- <br>sight in his old age. I once led him to the Haram in <br>Mecca, where he heard a group of people exchanging <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>hot words among themselves. He asked me to lead him <br>to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu Alaikum.' <br>They requested him to sit down, but he refused and <br>said: 'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in <br>high esteem? These are those whom His fear has <br>driven to absolute silence, even though they are <br>neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors <br>of eloquence and have power to speak and sense to <br>understand. But constant glorification of Allah's name <br>has so over-powered their wits that their hearts are <br>overawed and their lips sealed. When they get estab- <br>lished in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. <br>Whither have you people deviated from this course? <br>After this admonition, I never saw an assembly of even <br>two persons in the Haram.\" <br>It is said that Hadhrat Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to weep so much with Allah's fear that the tears <br>streaming down his cheeks had left permanent marks on <br>them. <br>In this story, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has prescribed a very easy way to righteousness. <br>This is to meditate over the greatness of Allah. If this is <br>done, it becomes very easy- to perform all other acts of <br>righteousness with full sincerity. Is it so very difficult to <br>devote a few minutes, out of the twenty four hours of a day <br>at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation? <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passing <br>near the ruins of Thamud during Tabuk expedition: <br>The Tabuk expedition is one of the major campaigns of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and the last one <br>in which he personally took part. When he received the <br>news that the Caesar (of Rome) had mustered a large force <br>to crush the power of Islam and was on his way (through <br>Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah <br>to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 <br>A.H., the devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the <br>weather was hot and the fighting was expected to be very <br>tough. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made an <br>open declaration that the Muslims should gather in <br>strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman <br>Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the <br>equipment of the expedition. It was on this occasion that <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>S c  <br>CI a <br>belongings. When he was questioned by the Prophet (Sal- .z <br>0 s<br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what he had left for his <br>2\"<br>family, he replied: <br>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) for them.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his <br>belongings and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) pro- <br>vided for the equipment of one-third of the whole army. <br>Although everybody, contributed beyond his means, yet <br>the equipment fell far short of the requirements. Only one <br>camel was available for each group of ten persons, who <br>were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known <br>as: \"The campaign of hardship.\" <br>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The or- <br>chards were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi- <br>nah) and it was just the time for harvesting, when all of a <br>sudden the Sahabah were required to start on this cam- <br>paign. It was really an acid test of their Imaan. They visual- <br>ised the long and arduous journey, the scorching heat, the <br>formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top all, the <br>prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not even <br>dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on ac- <br>count of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. <br>Except the women, children (who were excusable), those <br>who were ordered to stay behind by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, nearly every- <br>body joined the expedition. Also among those left behind <br>were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for <br>themselves, nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) able to provide them with any. It is about such people <br>that Allah says in his Book: <br>\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in <br>sorrow that they could not find means to spend.\" <br>(IX:92) <br>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any <br>excuse whatsoever were three in number. Their story <br>would be presently related. On their way to Syria when the <br>expedition reached the habitat ion of Tharnud, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his face with his shirt <br>and quickened the pace of his camel. He also instructed the <br>4<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scS.ne of Tha- <br>mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weep- <br>ing and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had <br>punished the Thamud. <br>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Alish and <br>his privileged companions pass by the ruins of the Fun- <br>ished people in fear and tears, lest they meet the same fate; <br>on the other hand today, if any place is struck with an <br>earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing for us and, if <br>we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and our <br>hearts unaffected. What a change of attitude! <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ka'ab's (Radhiyallaho anho) Failure to Join <br>the Tabuk Expedition: <br>Among the Munafiqin who did not join the Tabuk ex- <br>pedition, there were more than eighty persons from among <br>the Ansar and an equal number from amongst the nomadic <br>Arabs and a large number from the out-stations. Not only <br>did they stay behind themselves, but they induced others <br>to do SO saying: <br>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" <br>Allah's reply to thie was: <br>(*\\ $9)I> bi *ju ji <br>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\" <br>From amongst the .f&thful, there were only three persons <br>who failed to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura- <br>rah bin Rabi, Hilal MR Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Rad- <br>hipallaho anhum). Murarah had orchards of dates, laden <br>with fruit. He pershaded himself to lag behind with the <br>piea: <br>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What <br>possible harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this <br>one?\" <br>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this <br>prevented him from going out. But when he realised his <br>folly, he gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, <br>too, that had caused him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's case was different. Some <br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>4 7<br>of his kinsfolk who had been away for a long time had just <br>returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their company <br>that he did not join the expedition. He also had partici- <br>pated in all the campaigns previously and thought (like <br>Murarah) that it would not matter much if he missed just <br>that one campaign. When he came to know of the serious- <br>ness of his default, he made up his mind to sever all his <br>connections with those relatives who had been the cause of <br>that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, <br>which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says: <br>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at the <br>time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had <br>never possessed this number before. It was a habit with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never <br>disclosed the destination of his expeditions, but he <br>would k e e ~  <br>enquiring about the conditions prevailing <br>elsewhere. But this time in view of the distance, the <br>hot season, and the strength of the enemy, he had de- <br>clared his destination, so that preparations could be <br>made thorough and complete. The number of the par- <br>ticipants was so large that it was difficult to note down <br>their names even, so much so, that absentees could <br>hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of <br>Madinah were full of fruit. I intended every morning to <br>make preparation for the journey but, somehow or <br>other, the days passed by and I made no progress. I <br>was satisfied that I had all the necessary means at my <br>disposal and that I would be ready in no time if I once <br>did decide to do so. I was still in this state of indeci- <br>sion when I learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho daihe <br>wasallam) had left with his companions. The idea still <br>lingered in my mind that I would take a day or two to <br>get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination <br>continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in <br>Tabuk drew very near. I then tried to get ready but <br>again, somehow or other, I did not do so. Now, when I <br>came to look at the people left behind, I realised that <br>there was none in Madinah except those who had been <br>condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially <br>exempted from going for certain reasons. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk in-<br>quired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' <br>Somebody said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in <br>wealth and ease has caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az <br>Stories of the ~ a h a a b a h  <br>interrupted and said, No, this is wrong. As far as our <br>knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's <br>return. I was struck with grief and remorse. Good ex- <br>cuses one after the other entered my mind, and I was <br>sure that I could escape the Prophet's wrath with one <br>of them for the time being, and later on I could pray for <br>forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice of the wise <br>men of my family in the matter. But when I knew that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had actually <br>arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth <br>would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain <br>truth. It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that whenever he returned from a journey <br>he would repair to the musjid, first of all, say two <br>rakaat 'Tahiyyatul musjid' and then stay there for a <br>while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in the <br>musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on <br>solemn oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany <br>him on the campaign. He took them at their words, <br>leaving the rest to Allah. Just then I came and greeted <br>him with 'salaam'. He turned his face with a sardonic <br>smile. I besought him with the words: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! You turn your face from me. By Allah! I am <br>neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my <br>faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. He then <br>said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had <br>you not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly <br>man, I am sure I would escape his displeasure through <br>(seemingly) reasonable excuses, for Allah has endowed <br>me with the gift of the gab. But in your case I am sure <br>that if 1 appease you with a false statement, Allah <br>would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, <br>I am sure that if I displease you by confessing the <br>simple truth, then Allah would very soon blow away <br>your displeasure. I, therefore, make bold to speak the <br>very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all. I had never <br>been so we11 to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking <br>the truth.' He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will <br>decide about you. When I left the musjid, many a man <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>of my clan blamed me and admonished me thus; <br>'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after <br>making some good excuse for once, you had requested <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pray for <br>your goodness, surely his prayer would have sufficed <br>you.' I inquired of them if there were any more people <br>like me. They informed me that there were two other <br>persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, <br>who also had admitted their faults like me and re-<br>ceived the same reply from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I knew that both of them were very <br>good Muslims and had participated in the campaign of <br>Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) issued <br>instructions that none was to speak with the three of <br>us.' <br>It is a cqmmon principle that displeasure is shbwn <br>where some attachment exists, and a reprimand is given <br>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incor- <br>rigible person would be a futile effort. <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho<br>alaihe wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted <br>us. Nobody was prepared to mix with or even speak to <br>us. It seemed as if I was living in a strange land alto- <br>gether. My own birth-place looked like a foreign local- <br>ity and my bosom friends behaved like strangers. 'The <br>earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur'an IX: <br>113)for me. The thing that worried me most was that, <br>if I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not lead my funeral prayer, <br>and if the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) died in <br>the meantime, I would be doomed for ever, with none <br>to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. The <br>other two companions of mine confined themselves to <br>their houses. I was the most daring of the three: I <br>would go to the market, and join the Jamaat for Salaat, <br>but nobody would talk to me. I would approach the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say 'Assa- <br>lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his <br>lips moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete <br>the Salaat by standing close to him, and I would look <br>at him from the corner of my eye to learn if he ever <br>cast a single glance at me. I noticed that when I was <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when I was <br>out of it, he would avert his face from me.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues: <br>\"When'this complete social boycott became too hard <br>for me to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata- <br>dah, my dear cousin, and greeted him with 'Assalamo- <br>alaikum'. He did not return my greetings. I said to him, <br>'For Allah's sake, do answer me one question. Do not <br>you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my <br>request, but again he would not speak. When I in- <br>quired for the third time. he simply said, 'Allah and <br>His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) know best.' <br>At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me <br>alone.\" <br>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, <br>when I noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from <br>Syria to sell his grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. <br>When people pointed me out to him, he came and <br>made over a letter to me from the Christian King of <br>Ghassan. Thus it read: 'We have come to know that <br>your master has ill-treated you. Allah may not-keep <br>you in abasement and in disgrace. You had better come <br>to us. We shall extend all help to you.' When I read <br>this letter, I uttered \"Inna-lillahi-wa-Inna-ilaihi-raaji-<br>oon\" To Allah we belong and to Him is our return; and <br>said; 'So my state of affairs (had) reached such an ebb <br>that even the Kafirs were aspiring to draw me away <br>from Islam.' I codld not imagine a calamity worse than <br>that. I went and threw the letter into an oven. There- <br>after I presented myself to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and exclaimed: '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Your indifference towards me has lowered me to such <br>an extent that even the Kafirs are building up their <br>hopes over me.\" <br>When forty days had passed in this condition, a mess- <br>enger of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>brought me this mandate: 'Be separated from your <br>wife' I inquired, 'Am I to divorce her?' He replied: 'No, <br>only be separated.' A similar message was delivered to <br>my other two companions as well. I consequently said <br>to my wife: 'Go to your parents and wait till Allah de- <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>cides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Hilal is an old man and there is nobody else to look <br>after him. If I go away from him, he will perish. If it is <br>not very serious, kindly permit me to keep attending to <br>him.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; <br>'There is no harm, provided you don't indulge in coha- <br>bitation with each other.' She remarked! '0,Prophet of <br>Allah: He has no urge for such a thing; since the day <br>his ordeal has started, he has been spending his entire <br>time in weeping.\" <br>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to <br>keep my wife with me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is <br>old, while I am young. I do not know what reply I shall <br>get and, as such, I have no courage to make the re- <br>quest.' Another ten days passed and now our ordeal <br>had lasted for a full fifty days. On the morning of the <br>fiftieth day, when I had said my 'Fajr' prayer and was <br>sitting on the roof of my house stricken with grief, and <br>the earth had 'straightened' for me and the life had <br>become dismal for me, I heard a crier's cry from over <br>the top of the mount Sula; 'Happy tidings to you, 0, <br>Kaab.' The moment I heard this, I fell prostrate on the <br>ground and tears of joy rolled down my cheeks, as I <br>understood that the ordeal was now over. In fact, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had announced <br>the Divine forgiveness for all three of us after the <br>Salaat that morning. At this, a person ran up the top of <br>the mountain and yelled out the cry that had reached <br>me. Thereafter, a rider came galloping to deliver the <br>same happy news to me. 1 gave away as a gift the <br>clothes, I was wearing, to the messenger of glad tid- <br>ings. I swear by Allah I had no other clothes in my pos- <br>session at that time. I dressed up by borrowing clothes <br>from some friend and went to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). As I entered the musjid, the people <br>in the audience of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ran to congratulate me. Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was the first to approach me. He shook my hand <br>with a warmth that I shall never forget. Thereafter I of-<br>fered my salutation to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I found his face beaming and radiant like <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the full moon. This was usual with him at times of ex- <br>treme joy. I said to him, '0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I propose <br>to give away in charity all that I possess as thanks for <br>the acceptance of my Taubah.' He said: 'This will be <br>too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to <br>keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the <br>Khaiber campaign.\" <br>He says: <br>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and as such I <br>am determined to speak nothing but the truth in <br>future.\" <br>The above story brings out the following salient <br>characteristics of the Muslims of that time:- <br>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. <br>Even the persons who had hitherto faithfully par- <br>ticipated in every expedition, had to bear the <br>brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call <br>even though for the first time in their lives. <br>(2) \t Their devotion and obedience to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallabo alaihe wasallam). For full fifty days the <br>whole Muslim community, even their nearest and <br>dearest, would not speak to the three persons, in <br>obedience to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) orders. The three persons themselves went <br>most steadfastly through the ordeal imposed on <br>them. <br>I <br>(3) \t Their strong faith. Kaab was so much perturbed <br>when he received the letter from the Christian <br>King, exciting him against the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). His words and his action at that <br>time are a testimony to the strong faith in his <br>heart. <br>Let us search our hearts and see how much devotion <br>we have in them for the observance of the duties we owe to <br>Islam. Leaving aside Zakaat and Hajj, which involve the <br>sacrifice of money, take the case of Salaat alone, which is <br>the most important pillar of Islam after Imaan. How many <br>of us are particular about it? <br><br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah \t<br>$= <br>%S <br>10. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reprimand .$l<br>on the Sahabah's Laughing: \t<br>3~ <br>r a  <br>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>-a <br>the musjid for Salaat, where he noticed some people laugh- <br>ing and giggling. He remarked: <br>\"If you remembered your death, I would not see you <br>like this. Think of your death often. Not a single day <br>passes when the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilder- <br>ness', I am a place of dust, I am a place of worms'. <br>When a Mo'min is laid in the grave, it says; 'Welcome <br>to you. It is good of you to have come into me. Of all <br>the people walking on the earth, I liked you best. Now <br>that you have come into me, you will see how I enter-<br>tain you'. It then expands as far as the occupant can <br>see. A door from Paradise is opened for him in the <br>grave and: through this door, he gets the fresh and fra- <br>grant air of Paradise. But when an evil man is laid in <br>the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. Your <br>coming into me is very bad for you. Of all the persons <br>walking on the earth, I disliked you most. Now that <br>you have been made over to me, you will see how I <br>treat you!' It then closes upon him so much that his <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other. As <br>many as seventy serpents are then set upon him, to <br>keep biting him till the Day of Resurrection. These ser- <br>pents are so venomous that if one of them happened to <br>spurt its venom upon the earth, not a single blade of <br>grass would ever grow.\" <br>After this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The grave is either a garden of Paradise or a pit of <br>Hell.\" <br>Fear of Allah is the basic and essential qualification of <br>a Muslim. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ad- <br>vised the believers to remember death, off and on, and to <br>keep the fear of Allah ever present in their hearts. <br>11. \tHadhrat Hanzlah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Pear of Nifaq: <br>Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) when he delivered a sermon. Our hearts <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>became tender, our eyes were-flowing with tears, and <br>we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet and re- <br>turned home. I sat with my wife and children and <br>cracked jokes with my wife, and I felt that the effect of <br>the Prophet's sermon had completely vanished from <br>my heart. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not <br>what I had been, and I said to myself; '0,Hanzalah! <br>You are a Munafiq'. I was striken with grief and I left <br>my house repeating these words in sorrow; 'Hanzlah <br>has turned Munafiq'. I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) coming towards me and I said to him; 'Hanzalah <br>has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What are <br>you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq'. I ex- <br>plained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and listen to his discourses <br>about Paradise and Hell, we feel as if both are present <br>before our very eyes but when we return home and are <br>absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, we forget <br>all about the Hereafter. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: 'My case is exactly the same.' We both went to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and I said; 'I <br>have turned Munafiq, 0 Prophet of Allah!' He inquired <br>about the matter, and I repeated what I had said to Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Thereupon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'By Him Who con- <br>trols my life, if you could keep up for all times the <br>fervour aroused in you when you are with me, angels <br>would greet you in your walks and in your beds. But, <br>0,Hanzlah! This is rare! This is rare!\" <br>We have to attend to our personal and impersonal <br>worldly affairs, and therefore we cannot be contemplating <br>the Hereafter for all the twenty-four hours of the day. <br>According to what has been said by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), complete absorption in the Hereafter is <br>rare, and it should not be expected by all. It is only for the <br>angels to remain in the same state for ever. In case of men, <br>the state of their mind changes with circumstances and en- <br>vironments. But we can see from this story how anxious <br>the Sahabah were about the condition of their Imaan. Hanz- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) suspects Nifaq in himself wher, he <br>feels that the condition of his mind at home is not the same <br>as it is when he is with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>12. A Few Miscellaneous Stories about the Fear of Allah: <br>It is very difficult to cover all that is said in the Qur'an <br>and the Hadith about the importance of fear of Allah. It <br>may, however, be understood that fear of Allah is an essen- <br>tial step towards all spiritual advancement. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Fear of Allah is the root of all wisdom\". <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to weep so <br>much with the fear of Allah that he lost his eyesight. He <br>said to somebody watching him: <br>\"You wonder at my weeping. Even the sun weeps with <br>the fear of Allah.\" <br>On another occasion, he is reported to have said: <br>\"Even the moon weeps with His fear.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once passed by <br>one of the Sahabah who was reciting the Qur'an. When he <br>came to the verse: <br>\"And when the heaven splitteth asunder and beco- <br>meth rosy like red hide\", <br>(LV: 37) <br>the hair of his body stood on end, and he was nearly <br>choked, with excessive weeping. He would cry and say: <br>\"Alas; what will happen to me on the day when even <br>the Heaven splitteth asunder. Woe is me!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alai-he-wasallam) said to him: <br>\"Your crying has made even the angels weep\". <br>Once an Ansari sat and wept after Tahajjud, saying: <br>\"I cry to Allah for protection from the fire of Hell\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have made the angels weep today\". <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>once weeping. His wife also began to weep on seeing him <br>in this condition. He enquired of her: <br>\"Why are you weeping?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She replied: \"Whatever makes you weep makes me weep <br>too\". <br>He said: \"The idea that I have to cross the bridge of <br>Siraat across Hell makes me weep. I don't know <br>whether I shall be able to cross over or fall into Hell\". <br>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a musjid. When <br>he recited the verse: <br>\"For when the Trumpet shall sound; Surely that day <br>will be a day of anguish\"! <br>(LXXIV:8& 9) <br>he fell down and expired. People carried his body to his <br>house. <br>Khulaid was saying his Salaat. During his Qiraat, when <br>he reached the verse: <br>\"Every soul will taste of death\" <br>(111:185) <br>he began to repeat it again and again. He heard a voice from <br>a corner of the room saying: <br>\"How often are you going to repeat this verse? Your <br>recitation has already caused the death of four Jinns\". <br>It is reported about another Sheikh that (while reciting <br>the Qur'an) when he reached the verse: <br>\"Then are they returned unto Allah, their Lord, the <br>Just, is not His the Command?\" <br>(VI:62) <br>he gave out a cry, shivered and breathed his last. <br>There are many stories of this type. Fudhail, a famous <br>Sheikh, says: <br>\"Fear of Allah leads to everything that is good\". <br>Shibli, another Sheikh of high position, says: <br>\"Whenever I have felt Allah's fear in me, I have found <br>a fresh door of knowledge and wisdom opened for <br>me\". <br>Ch. 11: Fear of Allah <br>In a Hadith, it is said: <br>\"Allah says; 'I do not impose two fears on my slave. If <br>he does not fear me in this world, I shall give him fear <br>in the next, and if he fears me in this world I shall save <br>him from all fears in the Hereafter\". <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"All things fear a person who fears Allah, while every- <br>thing is a source of fear to him who fears somebody <br>other than Allah.\" <br>Yahya bin Ma'az (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"If a man fears Hell as much as he is afraid of poverty <br>then he may enter into Paradise.\" <br>Abu Sulaiman Daarani (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"There is nothing but ruin for a heart that is devoid of <br>fear of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasall'am) says: <br>\"The face that gets wet with the smallest drop of tear <br>from the fear of Allah is safe from entrance into the fire <br>of Hell.\" <br>He also said: <br>\"When a Muslim shivers with the fear of Allah, his <br>sins fall away from him like the falling leaves of a <br>tree.\" <br>The dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"A person weeping with fear of Allah cannot go to Hell <br>until milk goes back into the teats (which is an im-<br>possibility)\". <br>Hadhrat Uqbah bin Amir (Radhiyallaho anho) once in- <br>quired of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"What is the way to salvation?\" <br>He replied: \"Hold your tongue, stay indoors and cry over <br>your sins.\" <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once inquired of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Is there anybody among your followers who will go to <br>Paradise without reckoning?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Yes,\" replied the Prophet, \"the person who often cries <br>over his sins.\" <br>There is another Hadith, in which my dear Master, <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"No drop is more dear to Allah than two drops; a drop <br>of tear shed in the fear of Allah, and a drop of blood <br>shed in the path of Allah.\" <br>It is said in a Hadith that seven persons would be <br>under the shade of the Arsh on the day of judgement. One <br>of them would be the person who remembered Allah when <br>all alone by himself, and tears flowed from his eyes with <br>awe of Allah and in repentence for his sins. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr [Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>:'One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot <br>should make the appearance of a weeping person.\" <br>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that, when he wept, he smeared his tears over <br>his face and beard saying: <br>\"I have heard that the fire of Hell does not touch the <br>place touched by these tears.\" <br>Thabit Banani was suffering from a disease of the eyes. <br>His doctor said to him: <br>\"Your eyes would be all right, provided you do not <br>weep in future.\" <br>He replied: \"What is the good of an eye if it cannot shed <br>tears.\" <br>Yazid bin Maisarah (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>'There can be seven reasons for weeping viz., extreme <br>joy, insanity, extreme pain, horror, artifice, intoxica- <br>tion and fear of Allah. A single tear shed in the fear of <br>Allah is sufficient to quench oceans of fire (of Hell).\" <br>Hadhrat Ka'ab Ahbar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I <br>\"By Him who holds my life in His (hands), I love to <br>weep for fear of Allah, with tears flowing down my <br>cheeks, rather than spend a mountain of gold in <br>charity\" <br><br>Ch. 11:Fear of Allah <br>59 3= <br>Cl a <br>There are numerous other sayings of the Saints and <br>'E;i<br>other pious people, indicating that weeping because of the <br>3,<br>rm<br>fear of Allah, and over one's sins, is very effective and ben- <br>eficial in attaining spiritual elevation. We should not, how- <br>ever, lose hope in Allah. His Mercy is all-embracing. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal!aho anho) says: <br>\"If it be announced on the Day of Judgement that all <br>except one individual shall go to Hell, my expectation <br>of the Mercy of Allah would make me hope that I may <br>be that chosen one. Again, if it be announced on that <br>day that all except one individual shall go to Paradise, <br>then my sins would make me fear that I may be that <br>condemned one.\" <br>It is therefore necessary that we should combine fear and <br>hope together in our hearts. Especially when the time of <br>death is apprdaching, we should have more hope than fear. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"None of you should die, except with a strong hope in <br>the Mercy of Allah.\" <br>When Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Radhiyallaho anho) ap- <br>proached his end, he sent for his son and asked him to read <br>to him the Ahaadith that induce hope in Allah and His <br>Mercy. <br><br>CHAPTER I11 <br>ABSTINENCE AND SELF-DENIAL OF THE SAHABAH <br>There is such a wealth of Ahadith about this aspect of <br>the Prophet's life that it is really difficult to chose a few ex- <br>amples. He said: <br>\"Abstinence is an asset of a Mo'min.\" <br>1. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Dislike <br>for gold: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"My Lord offered to turn the mounts of Mecca into <br>gold for me. But my supplication to Him was; '0, <br>Allah! I like to eat one day and feel hungry the next, so <br>that I may cry before Thee and remember Thee when I <br>am hungry; and be grateful to Thee and glorify Thee <br>when my hunger is gone!\" <br>Thus said our Prophet '(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>We profess to follow him and are proud of being in the fold <br>of his Ummat. Isn't. it incumbent upon us to follow him in <br>practice also? <br>2. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Life of <br>Abstinence: <br>Once, the prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided to stay away from his wives for one month, as he was <br>displeased with them on some account. He lived for that <br>one month in a separate room in the upper storey. A <br>rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>divorced his wives got afloat among the Sahabah. When 'U <br>mar heard of this, he came running to the musjid and <br>found the Sahabah sitting in groups, struck with grief over <br>the Prophet's suffering. He went to his daughter Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), who was a wife of the Prophet, and <br>found her weeping in her room. He said to her: <br>\"Why are you weeping now? Have I not been warning <br>you all these .times to refrain from any act likely to <br>cause the Prophet's displeasure'?\" <br><br>Ch. 111:Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 61 <br>He returned to the musjid and found some of the Sahabah <br>sitting near the pulpit and weeping. He sat there for some <br>time, but could not sit for long due to his excessive grief. <br>He went towards the room where the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was staying. He found Rabah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave, sitting on the steps. He asked him to go <br>and inquire of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>he could allow 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to see him. <br>Rabah went inside and came back to inform him that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held his peace and <br>said nothing. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the <br>musjid and sat near the pulpit. Again the anguish eating <br>his heart would not allow him any rest, and he requested <br>Rabah to convey his request to the Prophet a second time. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did not make any <br>answer this time too. After tarrying near the pulpit for <br>some time more, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) craved per- <br>mission to see the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the third time. This time, his request was acceded to. When <br>he was ushered in, he saw the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) lying on a date leaf matting. The crossed pattern <br>of the matting could easily be seen imprinted on his hand- <br>some body. He had a leather bag filled with the bark of the <br>datepalm as his pillow. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I greeted him with Assalamo alaikum and inquired: <br>'Have you divorced your wives, 0,Prophet of Allah?\" <br>He answered in the negative. Much relieved, then I <br>made bold to remark, a bit amusingly; '0, Prophet of <br>Allah! we the Qureysh have always been having the <br>upper hand over our women, but in case of the Ansar <br>of Madinah, it is the women who have the upper hand. <br>Our women have also got influenced by the women <br>over here'. I said a few more similar things which <br>made him smile. I noticed that the contents of his <br>room consisted of only three pieces of tanned skin and <br>a handful of barley lying in a corner. I looked about, <br>but I failed to find anything else. I began to weep. He <br>said; 'Why are you weeping?' I replied: '0,Prophet of <br>Allah! why should I not weep? I can see the mat's pat- <br>tern imprinted on your body, and I am also beholding <br>all that you have got in this room. 0,Prophet of Allah! <br>Pray that Allah may grant ample provisions for us. The <br>Persians and the Romans who have no true faith and <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>who worship not Allah but their kings-Caesar and <br>Chosroes-presently live in gardens with streams run- <br>ning in their midst, but the chosen Prophet and the ac- <br>cepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire poverty!' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting <br>against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, <br>he sat up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt <br>about this matter? Ease and comfort in the Hereafter <br>are much better than ease and comfort in this world. <br>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good <br>things in this very world, whereas we have all such <br>things in store for us in the next. I implored him: '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! Ask forgiveness for me. I was really <br>in the wrong\" <br>Look at the household effects of the sovereign in this <br>world and in the hereafter, and the beloved Prophet of <br>Allah. See how he rebukes 'Umar when he asks him to pray <br>for some relief and comfort. <br>Somebody inquired of A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>about the bedding of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in her house. She said: <br>\"It consisted of a skin filled with the bark of date- <br>palm.\" <br>The same question was put to Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha); <br>she said: <br>\"It consisted of a piece of canvas, which I spread <br>doublefolded under him. Once I laid it fourfold in an <br>effort to make it more comfortable. The next morning <br>he asked me: 'What did you spread under me last <br>night?' I replied! 'The same canvas, but I had four- <br>folded it instead of the customary double fold.' He <br>said: 'Keep it as it was before. The additional softness <br>stands in the way of getting up for Tahajjud.\"' <br>Now let us look around and survey the furniture of our <br>bedrooms. We, who live in so much comfort, never hesitate <br>to complain of hard times, instead of being grateful and <br>more obedient to Allah for his bounties. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) in a State <br>of Hunger <br>. <br>Once, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) after <br>wiping his nose with piece of fine linen remarked to him- <br>self: <br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 63 <br>%,<br>b\"4<br>a <br>\"Look at Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho)! He cleans <br>.g<br>his nose with fine linen, today. I remember the time <br>~<br>v<br>l<br> <br>when he used to lie down between the pulpit and the <br>[\" <br>Prophet's house. People took him to be suffering from <br>epilepsy and put their feet on his neck. But there was <br>no other malady with him, other than spasms of <br>hunger.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) had to <br>remain hungry for days together. At times, he was over- <br>powered with hunger so much that he fell unconscious, <br>and people mistook this as attacks of epilepsy. It seems that <br>in those days they treated epilepsy by placing a foot on the <br>neck of the patient. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of those people who suffered from extremes of <br>want and poverty in the early days of Islam. He however, <br>saw better days in later years when Muslim conquests fol- <br>lowed in succession. He was very pious, and loved very <br>much to say the Nafl Salaat. He had with him a bag full of <br>date-stones. He used these stones for his Zikr. When the <br>bag was exhausted, his maid filled it again with date- <br>stones. Somebody was always busy in Salaat in his house <br>during the night; his wife and his servant taking turns with <br>him in the prayers. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (~adhiyallaho anho) Daily Al- <br>lowance from the Bait-ul Ma1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was a cloth <br>merchant and lived by that trade. On the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), people selected him <br>as the Khalifah. Next day with some cloth slung on his <br>arms, he was proceeding to the market as usual when <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) met him in the way. <br>'Urnar: <br>\"Where are you going to, Abu Bakr?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"To the market\". <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"If you get busy with your trade, who will <br>carry out the duties of the caliphate?\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t \"How am I to feed my family then?\" <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Let's go to Abu 'Ubaidah (In charge of\"Bait-ul- <br>Mal), who will fix some daily allowance for <br>you from the 13ait-ul-Mal.\" <br>They both went to Abu 'Ubaidah (Kadhiyallaho anho). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He fixed for Abu Bakr an allowance equal to that usually <br>paid to an average Muhajir. <br>Once Abu Bakr's (Radhivallaho anho) wife said to him: <br>\"I would like to have a sweet dish.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \"I have no money to arrange for the dish.\" <br>His wife: <br>\"If you permit, I shall try to save something <br>daily from our allowance, which will some day <br>make enough to enable us to prepare the sweet <br>dish.\" <br>He agreed. A little money was saved in many davs. When <br>his wife brought him the money to make purchases for the <br>sweet dish, he said: <br>\"It seems that we have received so much over and <br>above our needs.\" <br>He deposited the saving in the Bait-ul-Mal and for the <br>future got his allowance cut down by the amount saved by <br>his wife. <br>Hadhrat A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates: <br>\"When Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was selected as <br>Khalifah. he said to the people: 'You well know that I <br>live bv trade, and my income therefrom is sufficient to <br>meet mv expenses. Now I have to devote my full time <br>to the affairs of the state and therefore my family al- <br>lowance shall be paid from the 'Bait-ul-Mal.'\" <br>~ a d h r a tA'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"At the time of his death, Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) directed rjle to hand over to his successor all that <br>was issued to him from the Bait-ul-Mal for his house- <br>hold needs. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>left no cash after him. Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: <br>\"Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) left a milch she-camel, <br>a bowl and a servant.\" <br>A(;c;ording to some other narrators. he left a bedding also. <br>When all these were made over to 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), his successor, he remarked: <br>\"Mav Allah be merciful to Abu Bakr! He has set a pre-<br>cedent for his successors which is very hard t o  <br>follow.\" <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 65 <br>* <br>Sq <br>5. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Daily Allowance: <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) also lived by <br>trade. When he was made Khalifah after Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhivallaho anho), he assembled the people and said to <br>them: <br>\"I earned my living through trade. As you people have <br>engaged me as Khalifah, I cannot attend to my busi-<br>ness. Now, what about my living?\" <br>Different amounts of daily allowance from the Bait-ul-Mal <br>were suggested by different people. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not speak. 'Umar inquired of him: <br>\"Oh Ali! what is vour suggestion?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I suggest that you should take such amount as may be <br>on average be sufficient for vour family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) accepted his suggestion <br>and a moderate amount was fixed as his daily allowance. <br>Later on. some people including Hadhrat Ali. Hadhrat <br>Usman, Hadhrat Zubair and Hadhrat Talhah (Radhivallaho <br>anhum) once proposed that Hadhrat Umar's (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) allowance might be increased, as it was hardlv suffi- <br>cient for him. but nobody dared to suggest that to Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho). People approached Ummul- <br>momineen Hadhrat Hafsah (radhivallaho anha), his daugh- <br>ter, and requested her to ascertain 'Umar's (Kadhivallaho <br>anho) reaction to the suggestion without mentioning their <br>names to him. When Hadhrat Hafsah (Kadhiyallaho anha) <br>talked about it to tladhrat IJmar (Kadhivallaho anho), he <br>became angry and said: <br>\"Who are the persons making this suggestion?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Let me first know your opinion.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If I knew them, I would smite them on their faces <br>I-jafsah! just tell me what was the Prophet's best dress <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a pair of reddish brown clothes, which the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wore on Friday or <br>while receiving some envoy.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What was the best of food that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) ever took at your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Simple barley bread was the only food we used to <br>take. One day I anointed a piece of bread with the sedi- <br>ments from an empty butter tin, and he ate it with <br>relish and offered it to others as well.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>What was the best bedding that the Prophet ever used <br>in your house?\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"It was a piece of thick cloth. In the summer it was <br>spread in four layers, and in the winter in two, half he <br>spread underneath and with the other half he covered <br>himself .\" <br>Hadhrat mar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Hafsah! Go and tell these people that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has set a standard by his <br>personal example. I must follow him. My example and <br>that of my other two companions viz., the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and Abu Bakr (Radhival- <br>laho anho) is like that of three men travelling on the <br>same road. The first man started with a provision and <br>reached the goal. The second followed the first and <br>joined him. Now the third is on his way. If he follows <br>their way, he will also join them, otherwise he can <br>never reach them;' <br>Such is the life of the person who was a dread for the <br>monarchs of the world. What a simple life he lived! Once <br>he was reciting the Khutbah when it was noticed that his <br>lower cloth had as many as twelve patches, including one <br>of leather. Once he came late for his Jumu'ah prayer and <br>told the congregation: <br>\"Excuse me, people! I got late because I was washing <br>my clothes and had no other clothes to put on.\" <br>Once he was having his meal when 'Utbah bin Abi <br>Farqad (Radhiyallaho anho) asked permission to see him. <br><br>Ch. III: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 67 <br>He allowed him in and invited him to share the food with <br>him. 'Utbah (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the <br>bread was so coarse that he could not swallow it. He said: <br>\"Why don't you use fine flour for your bread, <br>'Umar?\" <br>Mesaid: \"Can every Muslim afford fine flour for his <br>bread?\" <br>'Utbah replied, \"No. Everybody cannot afford it.\" <br>He remarked, \"Alas! You wish to fulfill all my pleasures <br>while I am in this world.\" <br>There are thousands of such stories about the illus- <br>trious Sahabah. Everybody should not try to imitate them, <br>for we lack the physical strength of those people; and that <br>is why the Sufi Sheikhs of our time do not'recommend <br>such exercise, which tax the body too much, as the people <br>are already low in physical strength. We should however <br>keep the life of the Sahabah as an ideal before us, so that <br>we may at least give up some of our luxuries and lead a <br>simpler life (judged by modern standards). With the Saha- <br>bah's lives as an ideal, we can at least feel ashamed when <br>vieing with one another in running after the luxuries of this <br>world. <br>6. <br>Bilal's (Radhiyallaho anho) story about the Prophet: <br>Someone inquired of Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) how <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) met his expenses. <br>He replied: <br>\"He never kept back anything for future use. I arranged <br>money for him. Whenever a needy person, whether <br>hungry or naked, came to him, he would make him <br>over to me and I would then arrange for his needs by <br>borrowing money from somebody. This is what usually <br>happened. Once a Mushrik came to me and said: 'Look <br>here! I have a lot of money to spare. Don't borrow <br>money from anvbody else. Whenever you need it, <br>come straight to me.' I exclaimed: 'This is indeed fine.' <br>I began to borrow money from him to meet the needs <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). One day, <br>after I had taken mv Wudhu and was about to call <br>Azaan, the same Mushrik accompanied bv some <br>people came and shouted, '0,Negro!' When I attended <br>to him. he began to abuse me, using filthv language <br>and said: 'How manv davs are left of this month? 'I <br>Stories of the Saltaabah \t<br>said: 'It is about to finish. 'He said most insolently: <br>'Look here! there are only four days left of this month. <br>If you fail to clear up your debts by the end of the <br>month. 1 shall take you as my slave for my money and <br>then you will be grazing sheep as you have been doing <br>before.' After saying this he went away. I remained <br>melancholy and full of grief throughout the day. After <br>Isha when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was alone, I went and narrated the story to him, <br>saying: '0, Prophet of Allah! you have nothing with <br>you. nor can I arrange any money from somewllere so <br>quickly. I am afraid the Mushrik will disgrace me. I <br>therefore intend to keep away for such time as you get <br>sufficient money to clear the debts.' I went home, took <br>my sword, shield, and shoes, and waited for the morn- <br>ing to make for some other place. lust before dawn, <br>somebody came to me and said. 'Hurry up. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) wants you.' I hur-<br>ried to the musjid and found four loaded camels sitting <br>near the Prophet. He said: 'Good news. Bilal. Allah has <br>made arrangements for clearing your debts. Take these <br>camels with their load. The Chief of Fidak has sent <br>them as a gift to me.' I thanked Allah and took the <br>camels and cleared up all the debts. In the meantime, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) kept sitting in <br>the musjid. When I returned, I said: 'Alhamdulillah.' <br>All the debts are now clear, 0.Prophet of Allah' He in- <br>quired: 'Is there anvthing left from the gift?\" I said, <br>\"Yes, somethirlg is still left.\" He said. \"Go and spend <br>that as well. I shall not go home until the whole lot is <br>spent.' The Propket kept sitting in the musjid all day <br>long. After Isha he inquired again if everything had <br>been spent. I said: 'Something is still left unspent. A <br>few of the poor have not turned up so far.' He slept in <br>the nlusjid that night. Next dav after Isha'a he again <br>called me to him and said: 'Bilal! Is everything fin- <br>ished now?\" I said: 'Yes, Allah has blessed you with <br>peace. Everything is now spent and gone.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) begail to hymn the Glory <br>of Allah over this news, for he did not like death to <br>overtake him while any of the riches were in his pos- <br>session. He then went home and met his family.\" <br>It is common with pious people that they do not like to <br>keep any wealth with them. How could the Prophet (Sallal- <br>e <br><br>Ch. Ill: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 69 <br>laho alaihe wasallam), being the fountain-head of all piety, <br>like to keep anything in his possession? It is said of Mau- <br>lana Abdur Rahim (May Allah have mercy on him), a Saint <br>of our time, that all that he received as gifts from the <br>people was immediately spent by him and he did not keep <br>anything for himself. A few days before his death, he gave <br>over all his clothes to one of his attendants and said: <br>\"If I need to wear any clothes in my life. I shall borrow <br>them from you.\" <br>And I also know about my late father, who whenever had <br>any money left after Maghrib, would give it to someone of <br>his creditors (he was several thousand rupees in debt) and <br>would say 'I would not like to keep this source of trouble <br>with me for the night.' <br>7. \t<br>Another story of Hadhrat Abu Hurairah's (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) Hunger: <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I wish you had seen some of us living on a starvation <br>diet for several days, successively, so much so that we <br>could not even stand erect. On account of spasms of <br>hunger, I would lie on my belly and press my stomach <br>against the ground or keep a stone tied to mv abdomen. <br>Once, I intentionally sat in wait for some notable <br>people to pass that way. As Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhi- <br>yallaho anho) came along, I joined in conversation <br>with him, intending to continue the talk till we reach <br>his home, where I expected him to invite me to share <br>his meals, as was his wont. But his answer was brief, <br>and my plan did not work. The same thing happened <br>with Hadhrat Umar, (Radhiyallaho anho) when he <br>chanced that way. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) himself was the next to come. A smile spread <br>on his face when he saw me, for he at once divined <br>why I was sitting there. 'Come with me, Abu Hurairah', <br>lie said, and I accompanied him to his house. He took <br>me in. where a bowl of milk was brought before him. <br>He asked, 'Who brought this milk?\" and was told that <br>somebody had sent it as a present. HA bade me to go <br>and invite all the Suffah friends. The Suffah people <br>were treated as everyone's guests by all the Muslims. <br>I'hev were such persons who had neither hearth nor <br>home of their own, nor anv other means of livelihood. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Their number varied with time. But at this particular <br>juncture, they mustered seventy in all. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would send them in <br>groups of two or four each to the well-to-do Sahabah as <br>guests. He himself would pass on to them all that came <br>to him as 'Sadaqah', and would share the gifts too with <br>them.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>me to invite all these persons, I naturally had some <br>misgivings, for the! milk was so little that it could <br>hardly suffice a single person. Also, I was aware that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would ask <br>myself to serve the milk to the others first, and a server <br>is always the last and, more often than not, gets the <br>least of the lot. Anyway, out I went, and fetched them <br>all. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>me: Hadhrat 'Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho), do <br>serve the milk to them.' I took the bowl to each person <br>in turn, and he drank the contents to his heart's desire, <br>and returned the same to me, till all of them were <br>served. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>held the,goblet in his own hand, smiied at me, and re- <br>marked, 'Only two of us are left now!' 'Quite so', I re-<br>plied. 'Then take it,' he said. I needed no second <br>bidding, and took enough. He exhorted me to have <br>more, and I had my fill; till I declared that I had no <br>room for any more. He then took hold of the bowl, and <br>drained the still remaining milk.\" <br>I <br>8. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) opinion <br>about two persons: <br>Some people were sitting with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) when a person passed that way. The <br>Prophet (Sailallaho alaihe wasallam) asked of the company: <br>I <br>\"What do you think of this person?\" <br>They replied: <br>, <br>\"0.Pro het of Allah! He is the scion of a good family. <br>: <br>By Alla R, he is such that if he seeks in marriage the <br>hand of a woman of the most illustrious family, ne <br>would not be rejected. If he recommends anybody, his <br>recommendation would be readily accepted.\" <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 71 <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) held <br>his peace. A little later, another person happened to pass <br>that way, and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) put <br>the same question to his companions about that person <br>also. 'They replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is a very poor Muslim. If he is <br>betrothed somewhere, chances are that he will not get <br>married. If he happens to recommend anybody, his <br>recommendation is not likely to be accepted. If he <br>talks, few would listen to him.\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wssallam) re-<br>marked: <br>\"This latter person is better than a whole lot of such <br>persons as the former.\" <br>Belonging to a good- family carries absolutely no <br>weight with Allah. A poor Muslim, who is of little esteem <br>and who commands but little respect in this world, is far <br>nearer tc~ Allah than hundreds of the so-called noblemen <br>who, though respected and attended upon by the wordly <br>people, are far from the path of Allah. It is said in Hadith: <br>\"It will be the end of this world when there remains <br>not a single soul to hymn the name of Allah. It is by <br>the holy name of Allah that the system of this universe <br>is running.\" <br>9. \t<br>Privations go with love for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) <br>A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! I love you so much.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Think well before you say this.\" <br>The person: <br>\"I have already given thought. I love you very much, <br>0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Think once <br>again before you declare such a thing.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The person: <br>\"I still love you very much, 0,Prophet of Allah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Well, if you are sincere in what you say, then be pre- <br>pared to face privation and want coming to you from <br>all directions, for it pursues .all those who love me, as <br>swiftly as water running down-stream.\" <br>That is why we find the Sahabah living mostly a life of <br>poverty. Similarly the eminent Muhaddithin, Sufi's and <br>theologians lived hand to mouth throughout their life. <br>10. The Al-Ambar Expedition: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) despatched <br>towards the sea-shore an expedition of three hundred men, <br>under the command of Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in 8 A.H. He gave them a bag full of dates for <br>their rations. They had been hardly out for fifteen days <br>when they ran short of rations. In order to provide the con- <br>tingent with food, Hadhrat Qais (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>buying three camels daily from his own men, to feed the <br>Mujahideen, with a promise to pay on return to Madinah. <br>The Amir seeing that the slaughter of camels would de- <br>prive the party of their only means of transport, prohibited <br>him to do so. He collected the dates that had been left with <br>each person and stored them in a bag. He would issue one <br>date to each man as his daily ration. When Hadhrat Jahir <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) later on narrated this story to the <br>people, one of his aud?ence inquired: <br>\"How did you manage to live upon one date only for <br>the whole day?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"We longed even for that one date, when the whole <br>stock was exhausted. We were on the verge of starva- <br>tion. We moistened the dry tree-leaves with water and <br>ate them.\" <br>When they reached this stage, Allah had mercy on them, <br>for He always brings ease after every hardship, provided it <br>is endured patiently. A big fish known as \"Ambar\" was <br>thrown out of the sea for them. The fish was so big that <br>they lived on it for eighteen days altogether. They also <br><br>Ch. 111: Abstinence and Self-Denial of the Sahaabah 73 2- 4<br>2 s  <br>filled their satchels with the remaining portion, which -22 <br>lasted them right up to Madinah. When the episode was $2<br>* <br>narrated to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he <br>said: <br>\"The fish was a provision arranged for you by Allah.\" <br>Difficulties and hardships are not uncommon in this <br>world to the people of Allah; these are bound to come. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"The worst trials in this world are reserved for the <br>Prophets, then for those who are next to them, and <br>then for those who are best of the rest.\" <br>The trial of a person is proportionate to his position near <br>Allah, and He bestows solace and comfort by His Grace and <br>Mercy after each trial. Look how much our ancestors in <br>Islam have suffered in the path of Allah. They had to live <br>on leaves of trees, starve and shed their blood in the service <br>of the true faith, which we now fail to preserve. <br><br>r <br>CHAPTER IV <br>PIETY AND SCRUPULOUSNESS <br>The habits and traits of character of the Sahabah, as a <br>whole, are worth following, as they were the people <br>specially chosen and selected by Allah to be the compan- <br>ions of His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been sent in the best period of human history.\" <br>The time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>itself a blessed period, and the people favoured with his <br>company were really the cream of that age. <br>? <br>1. \t The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepts a <br>woman's invitation: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) 'was once re- <br>turning from a funeral, when a woman invited him to par- <br>take of some food at her house. He went in with some of <br>his Sahabah. When the food was served, it was noticed that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was trying to <br>chew a morsel, but it would simply not go down his throat. <br>He said: <br>\"It seems that the animal has been slaughtered without <br>the permission of its owner.\" <br>The woman said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I had asked a man to purchase a <br>goat for me from the market, but he could not obtain <br>one. My neighbour also had recently purchased a goat. <br>So I sent the man thither with some money to buy the <br>! <br>same from him: My neighbour was out and his wife <br>made over the goat to my man.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) directed her to go <br>and serve the meat to the captives. <br>It has been noted of pious and saintly Muslims that <br>I <br>food obtained from doubtful sources would simply not go <br>down their throats. So this is not such a surprising thing in <br><br>the case of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who is <br>the fountain-head of all piety. <br>2. \t<br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Sleepless <br>Night: <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spent a <br>sleepless night. He would turn from side to side and could <br>not sleep. His wife asked him: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Why can you not sleep?\" <br>He responded: <br>\"A date was lying about. I took it up and ate it, lest it <br>should be wasted. Now I am troubled lest it might be <br>from Sadaqah.\" <br>Most probably the date belonged to the Prophet him- <br>self, but because people sent him their 'Sadaqah' as well <br>(for distribution), he could not sleep with the apprehension <br>that it might be of Sadaqah. This is the last word in <br>scruples from the master himself, that he could not sleep <br>because of a suspicion in his mind. How would it go with <br>those who claim themselves to be the slaves of that very <br>master but indulge in usury, corruption, theft, plunder and <br>every other type of 'haraam' business without the least <br>scruple. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and a sooth- <br>sayer's food: <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had a slave <br>who used to give him a portion of his daily income as the <br>masier's share. Once he brought him some food, and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) took a morsel out of it. <br>Then the slave remarked: <br>\"You always enquire about the source of what I bring <br>to you, but today you have not done so.\" <br>He replied: <br>\"I was feeling so hungry that I failed to do that. 'Tell <br>me now, how did you come by this food?\" <br>The slave said: <br>\"Before I embraced Islam, I practised sooth-saying. <br>During those days I came across some people for <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>I <br>whom I practised some of my charms. They promised <br>t <br>I<br>to pay me for that later on. I happened to pass by those <br>people today, while they were engaged in a marriage <br>ceremony, and they gave me this food.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>'Ah! you would have surely killed me?\" <br>Then he tried to vomit the morsel he had swallowed, but <br>could not do so, as his stomach had been quite empty. <br>Somebody suggested to him to take water to his fill and <br>then try to vomit. He sent for a goblet of water and kept <br>on taking water and forcing it out, till the morsel was vomit- <br>ted out. Somebody remarked: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! You put yourself to <br>such trouble for one single morsel.\" <br>To this he made reply: <br>\"1 would have thrust it out even if I had to lose my life. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'The flesh nourished by haraam food, is des- <br>tined for the fire of Hell.' I, therefore, made haste to <br>vomit this morsel, lest any portion of my body should <br>receive nourishment from it.\" <br>Many stories of this nature have been reported about <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). As he was very <br>scrupulous and would not taste anything but that about <br>which he was perfectly sure, even the slightest doubt about <br>its being 'halal' would make him vomit what he had taken. <br>4. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) vomits out milk <br>of Sadaqah: <br>A person once brought some milk for Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). When he took it, he noted its queer <br>taste, and asked the person as to how he had come in pos- <br>session of the milk. He replied: <br>\"The camels given in Sadaqah were grazing in the <br>desert, and the attendants gave me this milk out of <br>what they got from them.\" <br>LJpon this. I-iadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) put his hand <br>in his throat and vomited all that he had taken. <br>These God-fearing people not only totally abstained <br>from 'haraam' food. but were most anxious to avoid anv <br><br>w <br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>3s:<br>%d<br>i;<br>doubtful morsel finding its way inside them. They could <br>.c2~<br>not dare taking anything that was 'haraam', which is so <br>usual these days. <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Bait-ul-Maal: <br>Ibn-Seereen writes: <br>\"When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he said to his daughter, Hadhrat Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), 'I did not like to take anything <br>from the Bait-ul-Maal, but Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) insisted on it, to relieve me of my occupation, <br>and to enable me to devote nly full time to the duties <br>of the 'Khilafat: and I was left no choice. Now make <br>over that garden of mine to my successor, in lieu of <br>what I have received from the Bait-ul-maal'. <br>When I-Iadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) died, Aishah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) asked Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to take over that garden, as desired by her late father. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"May Allah bless your father! He has left no chance for <br>anybodv to open his lips against him.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) received his <br>subsistence allowance from the Bait-ul-maal in the interest <br>of all the Muslirns, and that too at the request of the most <br>prominent Sahabah. Again the amount taken was almost <br>the minimum possible, and hardly sufficient for him, as we <br>have already seen in the story (in the last chapter) about his <br>wife's inability to cook one sweet dish during the whole <br>month. In spite of all this he was so scrupulous that he <br>made over his garden to the Bait-ul-nlaal i l l  lieu of ~vhat he <br>had received from the public funds. <br>6. \t<br>The story of Ali bin Ma'bad: (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>Ali bin Ma'bad (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mohaddith. He <br>savs: <br>\"I was living in a rented Iiouse. Once I wrote some- <br>thing which 1 wanted to drv up quicklv. The house <br>walls were of mud and 1 intended to scrape a little <br>mud from there to dry up the ink. But I thought: \"This <br>house is not mine, and I cannot scrape the walls with- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>out the owner's permission.' After a moment I reflec-<br>ted: 'After all what difference does it make? !t is only a <br>very little mud that I am using.' So, I scraped a little <br>mud from a wall and used it. That night, while asleep, <br>I saw a person in my dream, admonishing me: 'Per- <br>chance tomorrow, on the Day of Judgement, you may <br>rue that saying of yours: (It is, only a very little mud <br>that I am using)' \" <br>The dictates of piety are different with different per- <br>sons. The high rank of the Mohaddith demanded that he <br>should have been scrupulous even about a small quantity <br>of mud, though for a common man it was insignificant and <br>therefore within permissible limits. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) passes by a grave: <br>Hadhrat Kumail (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I was with Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once on a journey, <br>when he reached an uninhabited place; he approached <br>a grave and said: '0 you dwellers of the graves! 0 you <br>who live amongst ruins! 0 you who live in the wilder- <br>ness and solitude! How fare you in the other world? <br>How has it gone with you there?' He continued: 'The <br>news from our side is that all you did leave of the <br>wealth and riches here, has long been distributed; your <br>children are orphans; your widows have long since re- <br>married. Now let us hear about you.' He then turned to <br>me: '0 Kumail! If they could speak, they would have <br>informed us that the best provision for the Hereafter is <br>Taqwa.' Tears yelled out of his eyes, as he added: '0 <br>Kumail! The grave is a container of the deeds; hut one <br>realizes it only after death.\" <br>Our good or bad actions are stored up in our graves. It <br>is said in a Hadith that every person meets his good deeds <br>in the grave in the person of an agreeable companion who <br>befriends and consoles him there. But his wicked deeds <br>assume hideous shapes emitting bad smells, which add to <br>his misery. In another Hadith it is said: <br>\"Three things accompany a person to his grave viz: His <br>wealth (as was the prevalent custom among the Arabs <br>of the time), his relatives, and his deeds. His wealth <br>and his relatives turn back after his burial, but his ac- <br>tions go in and stay with him in the grave.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked the <br>Sahabah: <br>\"Do you know in what relation your relatives, your <br>wealth, and your deeds stand to you?\" <br>The Sahabah expressed their desire to know about it. Me re- <br>plied: <br>\"It can be likened to a person having three brothers. <br>When he is about to die, he calls one of his brothers to <br>him, and asks him: 'Brother! You know what plight is <br>mine? What help can you render me at this juncture?' <br>That brother replies: ''I shall call the doctor to you, <br>nurse you and attend upon you. And when you are <br>dead, I shall bathe you, enshroud you, and carry yau to <br>the grave. .Then I shall pray for you after you are <br>buried. This brother is his kith and kin. He puts the <br>same question to the second brother, who delivers <br>himself like this: 'I shall remain with you as long as <br>you are alive. No sooner you are dead than I shall <br>betake myself to someone else,' This brother is his <br>wordly wealth. He then questions the last brother in <br>the same strain, who makes response: 'I shall not for- <br>sake you even in your grave; and I shall accompany <br>you into that place of utter solitude. When your deeds <br>are weighed in the balance. I shall forthwith lend my <br>weight to the scale of your good deeds and weigh it <br>down.' This brother is the personification of his good <br>deeds. Now, tell me, which of the brothers you regard <br>to be the most useful to the person?' The Sahabah re- <br>plied: '0, Prophet of Allah! The last brother is really <br>the most useful to him. There is no doubt about it. The <br>other two brothers were of no avail.\" <br>8. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) verdict <br>about haraam food: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"As Allah Himself is above all blemishes, likewise. He <br>blesses with His grace only the unblemished thi~igs. He <br>enjoins upon the Muslims, what He has laid 3own for <br>His Prophets. He savs in His Holy Book: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>\"0,Prophets! Eat of the good things and do right. Lo! I <br>amaware of what ye do.\" <br>(XXIII:511. <br>\"0 Ye who believe Eat of the good things where-with <br>we have provided you.\" <br>(11:172) <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did <br>mention of a person who is a way-farer with dishevelled <br>hair and dusty clothes; raising his hands towards the <br>heaven, he calls out: \"0,Allah! 0, Allah!\" but his food, <br>drink and dress all were from haraam sources. So, Allah <br>would never listen to him and answer his prayers, even <br>though his outward condition showed him deserving. <br>People wonder why the prayers of the Muslims are not <br>alwavs fulfilled bv Allah: the reason is easy enough to <br>understand in the light of the above Hadith. 'l'hough Allah <br>does sometimes grant the prayers of even a Kafir (not to <br>mention the prayer or requests of a sinful Muslim). but it is <br>pnrticularlv the prayer of a pious person that is seldom re- <br>jected. That is the reason why people generally seek the <br>prayers of such persons for themselves. It follows that <br>those who wish to have their prayers often granted must <br>abstain from haraam. No wise person would like to run the <br>risk of his prayers being rejected. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) does not like his <br>wife to weigh musk: <br>I-ladhrat (Jmar (Kadhiyallaho anhn) once received some <br>nli~skfrom Bahrain. I-le said: <br>\"I tvant someone to weigh it, so that it mav be equally <br>distri1)uted among the Muslims.' <br>llis ~viit? said: \"1 shall weigh it..\" <br>tiiiclhriit Umar (Kadhivallaho anho) kept quiet. A little later <br>ht: again asked for someone to weigh the musk, and again <br>his wife volullteered to do so. But he kept quiet this tiine <br>too. C'lrhen she repeated her offer for the third time, he said: <br><br>Ch. IV: Piety and Scrupulousness <br>\"I do not like your touching the musk with your hands <br>(while weighing it) and rubbing those hands on your <br>body afterwards, as that would amount to something <br>over and above my legitimate share.\" <br>Any other person weighing the musk would, for that <br>matter, have had the same advantage, but Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) did not like this preference particu- <br>larly for any member of his own family. Look at this scru- <br>pulous anxiety to avoid charge of selfishness. <br>A similar story is related about Hadhrat Umar bin <br>Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) (who is known as the <br>second Umar). While he was holding the reins of the Khila- <br>fat, musk belonging to the Bait ul-Maal was being weighed. <br>He closed his own nostrils, with the remark: <br>\"The use of musk is to smell it.\" <br>These were the scruples of the Sahabah, and their suc- <br>cessors, and our elders in Islam. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>dismisses a governor: <br>Hadhrat Umar-bin-Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) ap- <br>pointed a person as governor of a province. Somebody re- <br>marked that this person had held the same post under <br>Hajjaj-bin-Yusuf (the notorious blood shedder) also. Hadh- <br>rat Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah alaih) immediately <br>issued orders of his dismissal. The man protested: <br>\"I had been with Hajjaj only for a very short time.\" <br>To this, the Khalifa replied: <br>\"His company for a day or even less is sufficient t~ <br>render a man unfit for public service.\" <br>\"A man is known by the companv he keeps.\" The <br>company of pious people leaves an imperceptible impres- <br>sion of piety on the character, and likewise evil company <br>has its evil influence. That is why association with bad <br>people is always discouraged. Even the companv of ani- <br>mals is not without its own effect. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Pride and arrogance are prone to be found in those <br>who own camels and horses, while meekness and hu- <br>mility characterise those who tend sheep and goats.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"A person who associates with a pious man is like one <br>who sits with a musk-seller. Even if he does not re- <br>ceive any musk from the latter still the pleasant smell <br>would be a source of pleasure to him. But bad com- <br>pany may be likened to a furnace; a man sitting near <br>one cannot escape the smoke and the fumes, even if a <br>spark does not fall on him.\" <br><br>CHAPTER V <br>DEVOTION TO SALAAT <br>Salaat is the most important of all forms of worship. It <br>is, in fact, the first and foremost item to be reckoned with <br>on the Day of Judgement. .The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the only line of demarcation between Kufr <br>and Islam.\" <br>There are many Ahadith about Salaat, which. I have col- <br>lected in a separate book. <br>1. \t Blessings of Nafl (non-obligatory) Prayers: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reported that <br>Allah told him: <br>\"My wrath descends upon a person who bears ill-will <br>towards My friends. And only those are blessed with <br>My love who implicitly carry out Fardh (obligatory) in- <br>junctions. A person keeps on advancing in my esteem <br>through 'Nafl'; till I choose him as 'My beloved'. I then <br>become his ear by which he listens, his eye by which <br>he looks, his hands by which he holds, and his feet by <br>which he walks (i.e. his listening, looking, holding and <br>walking are all in perfect accord with My injunctions, <br>and he would never even dream of employing any part <br>of his body in any action contrary to My commands). If <br>such a person prays for anything, I grant it to him and <br>if he seeks My protection I do protect him.\" <br>Those people are really blessed who, after performing <br>their Fardh, are in the habit of observing Nafl profusely. <br>May Allah give me and all my friends the strength to earn <br>this blessing. <br>2. \t<br>The Propet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spends the <br>whole night in Salaat: <br>A certain person asked A'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Tell <br>me something noteworthy concerning the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>She answered: <br>\"There was nothing which was not unusual about him. <br>Everything he did was noteworthy. One night he came <br>and lay down with me. After sometime, he got up <br>saying, 'Now let me pray to my Lord, the Sustainer.\" <br>With this, he stood up in Salaat, humbling himself before <br>his Creator with such sincerity that tears rolled down his <br>cheeks to his beard and on to his breast. He then bowed for <br>Ruku' and Sajdah, and his tears flowed down as fast as <br>before and after raising his head from his Sajdah, he con- <br>tinued weeping in this manner till Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) announced the approach of Fair. I pleaded with <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! vou are sinless, as Allah has in <br>His munificence forgiven your each and every sin <br>(even if committed) in the past and which may happen <br>in the life to come (XLVIII: 2) and still you grieve so <br>much\". He replied: Why, then, should I not be a grate- <br>ful slave of Allah? Then he added, 'Why should I not <br>be praying like this when Allah has today revealed to <br>me these verses?' <br>'Lo! in the creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and in <br>the difference of night and day, are tokens (of His Sov- <br>ereignty) for men of understanding, such as remember <br>Allah. standing'sitting and reclining . . . (111:190-191)' \" <br>It has been reported in many Ahadith that the Pro- <br>phet's feet would get swollen because of his very long ra- <br>kaats in Salaat; people tried to reason with him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are sinless and still you <br>labour so hard!\" <br>He would reply: \"Should I not be a grateful slave of my <br>Allah, then?\" <br>3. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recitation <br>of the Qur'an in Salaat: <br>Hadhrat 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>85 sa <br>2 2  <br>\"I was once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). He brushed his teeth with a Miswak, performed <br>.g 4<br>s w<br>his Wudhu and stood up for Salaat. I also availed of * <br>the opportunity to join him. He recited surah 'Baqarah' <br>in his first rakaat; he would pray for mercy when he re- <br>cited any verse extolling the Grace of Allah, and would <br>supplicate for Divine forgiveness when reciting any <br>verse referring to His wrath. He took as much time in <br>Ruku' and Sajdah each as he had taken in Qiyaam. In <br>Ruku' he recited: <br>'Glory to Allah the Lord of Majesty, sovereignty and <br>magnificence.' <br>He recited the next three successive Soorahs in the re- <br>maining three rakaats, and each rakaat was of about the <br>same length as the first one.\" <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) has also narrated a <br>similar story about his Salaat with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam.) <br>The Qiraat (recitation) of the Qur'an by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the above mentioned four <br>rakaats amounts to more than one-fifth of he whole Qur'an. <br>And the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited the <br>Qur'an with proper intonation (Tajweed), and would also <br>pray and seek forgiveness after relevant verses. Again his <br>Ruku' and Sajdah also would last as long as his Qiyaarn. <br>We can thus have a fair idea of how much time he must <br>have taken to say his Salaat. This can only be possible <br>when Salaat is a source of great inner satisfaction and spiri- <br>tual ecstasy. That is why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) has often been quoted as saving: <br>\"The comfort of mv eyes lies in Salaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>Salaat of a Few Eminent Sahabah: <br>Hadhrat Mujahid (Radhiyallaho anho), describing the <br>Salaat of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), and that <br>of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"They stood in Salaat motionless like pieces of wood <br>stuck in the ground.\" <br>'Ulama agree that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyai- <br>laho anho) learnt to say his Salaat from Hadhrat Abu Hakr <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), who in turn learnt it direct from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is said about Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he remained in Sajdah for so long, and <br>kept so motionless therein, that birds would come and <br>perch on his back. He would sometimes remain in Sajdah <br>or Ruku' all night long. During an attack against him, a mis- <br>sile came and hit the wall of the musjid wherein he was <br>saying his Salaat. A piece of masonry flew from the wall <br>and passed in between his beard and throat. He neither cut <br>short his Salaat, nor was he the least perturbed. Once he <br>was saying his Salaat while his son Hashim was sleeping <br>near him. A snake fell from the ceiling and coiled round <br>the child. The child woke up and shrieked, and the whole <br>household gathered round him. They killed the snake after <br>a great hue and cry. Ibne Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), calm <br>and quiet, remained engaged in his Salaat all the while. <br>When he had finished it, he said to his wife: \"I heard some <br>noise during my Salaat; what was that?\" <br>His wife exclaimed: <br>\"May Allah have mercy on you! The child's life was in <br>danger, and you took least notice of it.\" <br>His answer Mas: <br>\"Had I turned my attention to anything else, what <br>would have remained of the Salaat?\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was stabbed at the <br>close of his career, and this same wound caused his death. <br>He bled profusely and remained unconscious for long in- <br>tervals. But when hewas informed of the time of Salaat, he <br>would perform it in that very condition, and say: <br>\"There is no portion in Islam for the person who dis- <br>cards Salaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) would remain in <br>Salaat all night long, finishing the whole of the Qur'an in <br>one rakaat. <br>It is reported about Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that he would turn pale and tremble at the time of Salaat. <br>Somebody asked him the reason, and he said: <br>\"It is the time to discharge that trust which Allah of- <br>fered to the Heavens and the Earth and the hills, but <br>they shrank from bearing it, and I have assumed it.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>Somebody asked Khalaf-bin-Ayub: <br>\"Do not the flies annoy you in your Salaat?\" <br>His answer was: <br>\"Even the sinful persons patiently bear the lashes of <br>the government, to boast of their endurance afterwards. <br>Why should I be made to skip about by mere flies <br>when standing in the presence of my Lord?\" <br>Muslim bin Yasaar when he stood up for Salaat, said to <br>members of his family: <br>\"You may keep on talking, I shall not be knowing what <br>you talk.\" <br>Once he was saying his Salaat in the Jaami' musjid of <br>Basrah. A portion of the musjid wall fell down with a <br>crash; and eveFy body ran pel1 me11 for safety, but he never <br>even heard the noise. <br>Somebody asked Haatim Asam as to how did he say <br>his Salaat. <br>He replied: <br>\"When the time for Salaat comes, I perform my Wudhu <br>and go to the place where I have to say my Salaat. I sit <br>down for some time, till all the parts of my body are re- <br>laxed. Then I stand up for Salaat, visualising the <br>Ka'bah in front of me, imagining my feet upon the <br>Bridge of Siraat, with Paradise to my right, and Hell to <br>my left, and Izraa-eel close behind me, and thinking <br>that it may be my last Salaat. Then I say my Salaat <br>with full sincerity and devotion. And I finish my <br>Salaat between fear and hope about its acceptance. <br>5. <br>Salaat of a Muhajir and an Ansari keeping watch: <br>While returning from a campaign, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) happened to halt for the night at <br>some place. He inquired: <br>\"Who would keep watch over the camp this night?\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar bin Yasir (Radhiyallaho anho) of the Mu- <br>hajirin and Hadhrat Abbaad bin Bishr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>of the Ansar offered their services. Both of them were <br>posted to watch from a hill-top against any possible night <br>attack by the enemy. <br><br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) said to Ammar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Let us keep watch and sleep turn by turn. In the first <br>half of the night I shall keep awake, while you go to <br>sleep. In the next half. you may keep watch while I go <br>to sleep.\" <br>Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) agreed and went <br>to sleep, and Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) started <br>his Salaat. But an enemy scout made him out in the dark <br>from a distance. and let flv an arrow at him. Seeing that he <br>made no movernent, he shot another and still another <br>arrow at him. Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhivallaho anho) drew <br>out arid threw away each arrow as it struck him, and at last <br>awakened his conlpanion. The enemy fled when he saw <br>them both together. fearing that there might be many more <br>of them. Hadhrat Ammar (Radhivallaho anho) rioticed <br>Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) bleeding from three places. He <br>said: <br>\"Subhanallah! whv did you not awake me earlier?\" <br>Abbaad replied: <br>\"I had started.reciting Surah 'Kahf' in my Salaat. I did <br>not like to cut it short. but when I was struck by the <br>third arrow. ,I was greatly concerned that my death <br>might jeopardise the safety of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). I therefore finished the Salaat and <br>awakened you. But for this fear. I would not have gone <br>to Ruku' before finishing the Surah even if I had been <br>killed.\" <br>I <br>Look at the devotion of'the Sahaba to Salaat. One <br>arrow after another is piercing Hadhrat Abbaad's (Rad-<br>hiyallaho anho) body and he is bleeding profusely, but is <br>not prepared to sacrifice the pleasure of reciting the Qur'an <br>in his Salaat. On the other hand, the bite of a wasp, nay of a <br>mosquito, is sufficient to distract us from our Salaat. <br>According to the Hanafiyvah school of jurisprudence, <br>Wudhu breaks with bleeding, while according to the Sha- <br>fi'iyyah it does not. lt is just possible that Abbaad might be <br>having the latter view. or that this point might not have <br>been brought to an issue till then. <br><br>6. \t<br>Hadhrht Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>m<br>Salaat: \t<br>.-<br>,om <br>V1 <br>Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) was once <br>saying his Salaat in his garden. His attention was drawn to- <br>wards a bird that flitted about, but could not find a way out <br>of the dense foliage. For a short moment, he followed the <br>bird with his eyes, and forgot the number of his rakaat. <br>Upon this mishap, his sorrow knew no bounds. He re-<br>paired to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pres- <br>ence straightway and submitted thus: <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah, this garden of mine has been the <br>cause of a diversion in my Salaat. I give it away in the <br>cause of Allah. Kindly spend it as may appear proper <br>to you.\" <br>A similarchance befell one of the Ansaar in the time of <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). He was saving his <br>Salaat in his garden. The branches of the trees were <br>weighed down with ripe juicy dates, luxurious abundance, <br>which caught his eyes, and he felt pleased with it. This <br>made him forget the number of his rakaat. He was so much <br>stricken with grief that he decided to part with the garden <br>that had distracted him from his Salaat. He approached <br>Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) and made over the garden to <br>him for utilising it in the path of Allah. LJsman (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) had the garden sold for fifty thousand dirhams <br>and spent the money as desired. This shows the value the <br>Sahaba set on their faith; and Hadhrat Abu Talha (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) could give away his orchard worth fifty <br>thousand dirhams because it had interfered with his Salaat. <br>According to Shah Waliullah, the Sufis give preference to <br>obedience to Allah over anything that distracts from it. <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eye. A doctor told him: <br>\"A treatment is possible, provided you are willing to <br>take precautions. For five davs, it will be essential for <br>you to avoid prostrating yourself on the ground. You <br>can, however, use a wooden desk for performing <br>Sajdah.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>r <br>Hesaid: \t \"This cannot be so. I would not say a single <br>rakaat like that. I have heard the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A person who in- <br>tentionally foregoes a single Salaat shall have to <br>face Divine wrath on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Although it is quite permissible to perform Salaat in <br>the way advised by the doctors,. and it involves no direct <br>transgression of the Law of Allah, yet due to his utter devo- <br>tion to Salaat and implicit regard for the Prophet's warning, <br>he was ready to lose his eyesight rather than allow the <br>slightest modification in the Salaat as performed by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself. In fact, the <br>Sahabah would sacrifice the whole world for their Salaat. <br>We may dub it as 'fanaticism', or make any other remark <br>about that devoted band, but the verdict in the Hereafter <br>would prove, beyond doubt, that they were the personages <br>who really feared and loved their Creator above everything <br>else in this world. <br>8. \t<br>Sahabah's suspending trade at the time of Salaat: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once <br>visited the market. He noticed that at the time of Salaat, <br>everybody closed his shop and flocked to the musjid. He <br>remarked: <br>\"These are people about whom Allah has remarked: <br>\"Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when <br>hearts and eyeballs will be overturned. <br>(XXIV: 3 7)\" <br>i <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"These people were completely absorbed in their <br>trade, but when they heard Azaan they left everything <br>and hastened towards the musjid.\" \t<br>I <br>He once remarked: \"By Allah, they were such traders <br>whose trade did not hinder them from the remembrance of <br>I <br>Allah.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>91 SJZ <br>L. -<br>\"9 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>once chanced to be in the market when Azaan was called <br>3,<br>m<br>out. He noticed everybody leaving his shop as it was, and <br>proceeding to the musjid. He remarked: <br>\"These are surely the persons of whom Allah says: <br>'Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>from remembrance of Allah and constancy in Salaat <br>and paying to the poor their due. (XXIV:37).' <br>Another Hadith has it: <br>\"All the people shall be gathered on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, when it will be asked, 'Who are those who glori- <br>fied Allah in ease and adversity?\" A group will arise <br>and enter Paradise without any reckoning. Again it <br>will be asked, 'who are those who kept away from their <br>beds and passed their nights in worshipping their Cre- <br>ator.' Another group will arise and enter Paradise with- <br>out any reckoning. The angel will ask yet again, 'where <br>are those whom trade did not hinder from remember- <br>ing Allah.' And yet another group will arise and enter <br>Paradise without any reckoning. After these three <br>groups have departed, and reckoning would com-<br>mence for the people in general.\" <br>9. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Khubaib, Hadhrat Zaid and <br>Hadhrat 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anhum): <br>The Qureysh writhed with fury and rage at the loss of <br>some of their greatest men in Uhud. Sulaifah, whose two <br>sons had fallen in action, had taken a solemn vow that she <br>would drink wine in the skull of 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>who had killed both of them, if she could get possession of <br>his head. She had proclaimed a prize of one hundred <br>camels (a stupendous sum for the place and the time) for <br>the person who brought 'Asim's head to her. Sufyan bin <br>Khalid worked out a plan to secure the prize. He sent a few <br>men of Adhal Waqarah to Madinah, who pretended to em: <br>brace Islam: they besought the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) to detail some persons to accompany them to <br>their locality to preach Islam to the populace. They made a <br>special request for 'Asim (Kadhiyallaho anho) saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Our people will very much appreciate his mode of <br>address.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed ten (or <br>six according to another report) of his companions to go <br>with them, and 'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) was of course in- <br>cluded in these. They started satisfactorily from Madinah, <br>but treachery awaited them on the way; they were attacked <br>by not less than two hundred of the enemy, including one <br>hundred crack selected archers. The Sahabah climbed up a <br>hill called Fadfad. The eneniy called out to them: <br>\"We do not want to kill you; we shall only take you to <br>Mecca and sell you to the Qureysh.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) rejected this parley <br>and chose to fight to the finish. When they ran short of <br>arrows, they attacked the enemy with their spears. Hadhrat <br>Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) called out to his companions: <br>\"No doubt you have been betrayed by these treacher- <br>ous people, but you should not lose heart; because <br>martyrdom is itself the acme of your aspirations. Allah, <br>the most beloved, is with you, and your celestial <br>spouses are this minute waiting for you.\" <br>With these words, he rushed into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and when his spear broke he fought on with his <br>sword. Thus he fell fighting to the last. His last prayer was: <br>\"0,Allah! inform the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) about our fate.\" <br>Allah, in His compassion, answered his prayer by revealing <br>the news to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). As <br>'Asim (Radhiyallaho anho) had come to know about Sula- <br>fah's vow to drink wine in his skull, he also prayed: <br>\"0,Allah! I have laid down my life in Thy cause: 0, <br>Allah, do save my head from the sacriligeous hands of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>This prayer was also granted. After his death, a swarm of <br>bees (or wasps according to another report) settled upon <br>his body, and foiled all attempts of the enemy to sever his <br>head. They left the body alone, intending to do their.dirty <br>job during the night, when the bees would have gone. But <br>during the night, there was a cloud-burst, which washed <br>the body away. <br>I <br><br>To return to the fight, when seven out of the ten Saha- <br>bah (Radhiyallaho anhum) had attained martvrdom and the <br>remaining three, Khubaib, Zaid bin Wathnah and Abdullah <br>bin Tariq (Radhiyallaho anhum) were still sticking to their <br>position on the hill-top, the enemy again called out to <br>them: <br>\"You three should come down the hill: of course we <br>would do no harm to you.\" <br>The three trusted them and came down the hill, but the <br>enemy immediately pounced upon them. and pinioned <br>them with the gutstrings of their bows. Upon this, Abdul- <br>lah bin Tariq (Kadhiyallaho anho) protested: <br>\"So this is the very first breach of your solemn prom- <br>ise. I would rather join my martyred brothers than go <br>alive with you.\" <br>He then refused to follow them in captivity. They tried <br>their best to make him walk, but could not, and ultimately <br>perceiving that he would on no account budge an inch <br>from the spot, despatched him there and then. The two re- <br>maining captives were taken by them to Mecca and sold to <br>the Qureysh. Safwan bin Umayyah paid fifty camels for <br>Zaid bin Wathna (Kadhiyallaho anho] to kill him in re- <br>venge for the death of his father Umayyah in 'Uhud', and <br>Hujair bin Abi Ahaab bought Khubaib (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>for one hundred camels to avenge the fall of his father in <br>the same battle. <br>Safwan made over Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>to his slave to be killed outside the limits of the Haram. A <br>crowd followed them to watch Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anhp) meet his end, and Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also happened to be one of the spectators. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) stood prepared to meet his doom, Abu <br>Sufyan asked him thus: <br>\"Don't yo11 \\I ,11 hluhalnmad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to be in vour place today, and you be let off to <br>enjoy life with your family?\" <br>Zaid's (Kadhivallaho anho) replv amazed them all: <br>\"Hv Allah!\" he said. \"the trerv tho~~ght <br>of enjoying life <br>with nlv family is unbearable to me. if the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were even to suffer a <br>thorn-prick in his foot for that.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Qureysh simply could not understand this reply, and <br>Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"There is absolutely no parallel, anywhere in the <br>world, to the love that the companions of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bear him.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was then martyred. <br>Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the <br>captivity of Hujair for a long time. A woman slave of Hujair <br>(who later embraced Islam) says: <br>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in <br>captivity with us, I noticed one day that he was eating <br>grapes from a bunch as big as a human head, though it <br>was not the season of grapes in Mecca at that time. <br>When the day for his execution drew near, he asked for <br>a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile a <br>child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat <br>Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho). All the inmates of the <br>house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat Khubaib (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they <br>thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing <br>the child with the razor. But to remove their fears on <br>observing their alarm, Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhoj remarked: 'Do you think that I would stoop to <br>the killing of an innocent child? This heinous crime is <br>simply not possible for me.'\" <br>When he was brought to the gallows, and asked to <br>make his last wish, if any, he requested: <br>\"Allow me to say two rakaat of Salaat, for it is time for <br>me to leave the'world and meet my Allah.\" <br>They let him say his Salaat. On finishing the two rakaat <br>most calmly, he said: <br>\"But for your thinking that I was afraid of death, I <br>would have said another two rakaats.\" <br>He was then tied to the gallows. At that time he said: <br>\"0,Allah! There is nobodv to convey my last Salaam <br>to Thy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>And Allah sent his Salaam to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through an angel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) answered: <br>\"Wa alaikumus salaam! 0 Khubaib.\" <br><br>Ch. V: Devotion to Salaat <br>3 I11<br>and observed to the Sahabah: \t<br>'C C, <br>\"Khubaib has been martyred by the Qureysh.\" <br>m <br>S m  <br>At the gallows, forty of the Querysh speared him simul- <br>taneously. One of those teased him: <br>Say by Allah, if you now wish Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) to be in your place and you to be let <br>off.\" <br>He replied: \t \"By Allah the Most Magnificent. I will not tol- <br>erate a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in ransom for my life.\" <br>Every word of this story is a lesson for us all. The de- <br>votion and love of the Sahabah narrated therein is really <br>something to esteem and covet. They would lay down their <br>very lives, but they would not tolerate even a thorn piick- <br>ing the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Again, look at <br>Hadhrat Khubaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) last wish. He <br>neither remembers his family members nor wishes to see <br>any of them; what he wishes is to send his last Salaam to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and to say two last <br>rakaats of Salaat. <br>10. Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) company in <br>Paradise: <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"1 used to remain in attendance upon the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) at night. I would keep water, <br>miswak, praying mat, etc., ready for his Tahajjud. Once <br>he (being very pleased with my services) asked me, <br>'What would you wish most?' I submitted, '0,Prophet <br>of Allah. I wish your company in Paradise.' He asked <br>me if there was anything else I wished for. But I re-<br>plied. 'This is the only thing I long for.' Upon this, he <br>remarked. 'All right. You should help me by prostrat- <br>ing in prayer frequently.' \" <br>Here is a lesson for us. We should not depend on <br>verbal prayers alone, but we should also make some practi- <br>cal efforts to gain our object. The best of all efforts is Salaat. <br>Also, it would be wrong to depend entirely on the prayers <br>of saints and pious people alone. This is a world of cause <br>and effect: and, no doubt, Allah sometimes in His Wisdom <br>and Might does bring into effect things for which there is <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>no apparent and tangible cause, but this happens only on <br>very rare occasions. For us, as in this world we make all <br>possible efforts, and never depend on prayers alone nor <br>rest contented with our lot, so in all gains pertaining to the <br>Hereafter, we should try our best to conform to the conduct <br>demanded by religious and ethical standards, and not <br>regard verbal prayer as the only factor which counts, nor <br>like a fatalist leave all to a ruthless destiny. No doubt, the <br>prayers of pious people and lovers of Allah have their due <br>effect, but they only go to augment our own sincere efforts, <br>and even the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) to \"help\" him by prostrating <br>frequently (i.e., saying Salaat in his leisure hours too). <br><br>CHAPTER VI <br>SYMPATHY AND SELF-SACRIFICE <br>The Sahabah, as a class, were an embodiment of right- <br>eousness. They attained a standard that is rather difficult to <br>emulate in a modern society. We would be fortunate if we <br>really attain even a partial resemblance to their character. <br>Some of their qualities are peculiarly their own, and self- <br>sacrifice is one of these. Allah has made a mention of this <br>in the Holv Qur'an in these'words. <br>\"They prkfer others above themselves. even though <br>poverty become their lot. (LIX: 9).\" <br>1. Feeding the guest in darkness: <br>A Sahabi came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and complained of hunger and distress. Just then, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had nothing in hand, <br>or in his home to feed him. He asked the Sahabah: <br>\"Would anybody entertain him as a guest tonight on <br>my behalf?\" <br>One of the Ansaar said: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah, I will do that.\" <br>The Ansari took the person to his house and instructed his <br>wife: <br>\"Look here, this man is a guest of the Prophet [Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). We will entertain him as best as <br>we can, and won't spare anything in doing so.\" <br>The wife replied: <br>\"By Allah! I have got no food in the house, except a <br>verv little-something just enough for the children.\" <br>The Ansari said: <br>\"You lull the children to sleep without feeding them, <br>while I sit with the guest over the meagre meal. When <br>we start eating, put out the lamp pretending to set it <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>right, so that the guest may not become aware of my <br>not sharing the meal with him.\" <br>The scheme worked out nicely, and the whole family, <br>including the children, stayed hungry to enable the guest to <br>eat to his fill. It was over this incident that Allah revealed <br>the verse: <br>\"They prefer others above themselves, even though <br>poverty become their lot (LIX:9).\" <br>There are quite a number of similar incidents about the <br>Sahabah. The following is one of these. <br>2. Feeding a fasting Sahabi:<br>\\ <br>One of the Sahabah was keeping fast after fast, as he <br>could not get anything to eat. Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) came to know of this. He told his wife: <br>\"I shall bring a guest tonight. When we sit at the meal, <br>put out the lamp, pretending to set it right, and you are <br>not to eat anything until the guest has taken his fill.\" <br>The scheme worked out as in the last story. The husband <br>and wife sat with the guest and the simple soul never sus- <br>pected in the least that neither of them had partaken at all <br>of the food, though their hands and jaws seemed to be <br>moving all right. When Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) repaired to tbe Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) presence next morning, he was greeted with the <br>happy news; <br>\"0,Thabit! Allah has very much appreciated your en- <br>tertainment of the guest last night.\" <br>3. <br>Overpaymentof Zakaat: <br>Hadhrat Ubay bin Kaab (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once dep- <br>uted me to collect Zakaat dues from a locality. I went <br>to a person there, and asked about the details of his <br>possessions. A baby camel one year old was due from <br>him in Zakaat. When he heard this, he exclaimed, 'Of <br>what use is a baby camel, one year old? You can <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br> BG<br>'E;d<br>neither milk it, nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she- <br>8 4 <br>camel. You had better take this .instead.' I replied. 'My 3 3<br>commission does not permit me to take more than <br>rn <br>what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot <br>accept what you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is visiting this locality, and tonight he will <br>be camping at a place not very far from here. It is better <br>you should go and place your offer before him. If he <br>does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, other- <br>wise you shall have to give me exactly what is due <br>from you.' Thereupon, he took the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and besought him <br>thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came to re- <br>ceive Zakaat from me. By Allah! before this time, I <br>have never had the honour of paying anything to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) or his deputy. I <br>therefore placed everything that I possessed before <br>him. He decided that a baby camel one year old was <br>due from me. Now, 0, Prophet of Allah! This baby <br>camel is of no use. It can neither yield milk nor carry a <br>load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept a fine grown- <br>up she-camel in-stead; which he refused to accept <br>without your permission. I have now come to you with <br>the she-camel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) observed, 'No doubt only that much is due from <br>you which he has worked out, but if you are willing to <br>give more than that, of your own accord, it would be <br>accepted.' I then presented the she-camel to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which he accord- <br>ingly accepted and sought Allah's blessings for the <br>donor.\" <br>Look, with what magnanimity of heart the Sahabah <br>parted with their best things for the sake of Allah. On the <br>other hand, we too claim to be the true followers of Islam, <br>and ardent devotees of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) but, leaving apart the bestowing of alms in general <br>to the poor and the needy, we are most reluctant to pay the <br>actual obligatory dues. Zakaat, as a pillar of Islam, is not <br>even known to our upper classes. Of the middle classes, <br>only the religiously conscious strata keep up a form of <br>paying Zakaat, in as much as even the expenditure in- <br>curred on their own relatives and acquaintances, and all <br>other charitable donations squeezed out of them by the <br>force of circumstances and face-savings are debited to this <br>account. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) trying to emulate <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>for contributions in the path of Allah. In those days, I <br>was in possession of some wealth. I mused thus, 'Time <br>and again Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) has surpassed <br>me in spending for the sake of Allah. I shall by the <br>Grace of Allah surpass him this time, because I have <br>just now some wealth with me to spend'. I went home <br>buoyant with the idea. I divided my whole property <br>into two exactly equal parts. One I left for my family, <br>and with the other I rejoined the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who accosted me thus: <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'Did you leave anything for your family, 'Umar?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Yes, 0Prophet of '4llah.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallahd alaihe wasallam): <br>'How mu~h'?' <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Exactly one-half.' <br>By and by, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>along with his load. It transpired that he had brought <br>everything that he possessed. <br>This is what I heard: ' <br>The Prophet (Sa/lallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>'What did you leave for your family, Abu Bakr?' <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'I have left Allah and his Prophet for them.' <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that on that day <br>he admitted to himself that he could never hope to surpass <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Allah says in his Holy Book. <br>\"Vie one with another in good works (V:48).\" <br>Such healthy emulation in sacrifice is therefore quite <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>101 \t & <br>b a<br>0s <br>desirable and welcome. This incident happened at the time -84<br>of Tabuk, when the Sahabah in response to the Prophet's 2~<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appeal for help contributed <br>beyond their means. This has already been mentioned in <br>Chapter 11. May Allah grant them best rewards on behalf of <br>all the Muslims! <br>5. \t Sahabah dying thirsty for others: <br>Hadhrat Abu-Jahm-bin-Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates: <br>\"During the battle of Yarmuk, I went out in search of <br>my cousin, who was in the forefront of the fight. I also <br>took some water with me for him. I found him in the <br>very thick .of battle in the last throes of death. I ad- <br>vanced to help him with the little water I had. But, <br>soon, another sorely wounded soldier beside him gave <br>a groan, and my cousin averted his face, and beckoned <br>me to take the water to that person first. I went to this <br>other person with the water. He turned out to be <br>Hishaam bin Abil Aas (Radhiyallaho anho). But I had <br>hardly reached him, when there was heard the groan of <br>yet another person lying not very far off. Hisham (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) too motioned me in his direction. <br>Alas, before I could approach him, he had breathed his <br>last. I made all haste back to Hishaam and found him <br>dead as well. Thereupon, I hurried as fast as I could to <br>my cousin, and, lo! in the meantime he had also joined <br>the other two. <br>j <br>U! jp,6! <br>Many an incident of such self-denial and heroic sacri- <br>fice is recorded in the books of Hadith. This is the last <br>word in self-sacrifice, that each dying person should forego <br>slaking his own thirst in favour of his other needy brother. <br>May Allah bless their souls with His choicest favours for <br>their sacrifice for others even at the time of death, when a <br>person has seldom the sense to make a choice. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) shroud: <br>The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dear uncle, <br>and one of his earliest supporters. Hadhrat Hamzah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) fell in Uhud, and the ruthless enemy bru- <br>tally cut off his nose, ears and vitals. He was ripped open, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>and h ~ s  <br>heart, lungs and liver were torn out; and the whole <br>body was thoroughly mutilated. While the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was making arrangements for the <br>burial of the dead, he caught sight of Hadhrat Hamzah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) body, and was shocked to find it in <br>that condition. He covered the body with a sheet of cloth. <br>Presently, Hadhrat Hamzah's (Radhiyallaho anho) sister Sa- <br>fiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) also came to see her martyred <br>brother for the last time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) feared that the sight might be too much for her to <br>bear, bade her son Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) to <br>dissuade.her from seeing the body. She however, rejoined: <br>\"Yes, I have heard that the wretches have mutilated <br>my dear brother's body. It is not too much in the path <br>of Allah, and we should be resigned to it. I will bear all <br>this patiently, and may Allah in His Grace have mercy <br>on us all.\" <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) informed the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) of his mother's re-<br>solve, and he gave his assent to her seeing the body. When <br>she beheld what they had done to it, she simply exclaimed, <br>'Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon' and offered a prayer <br>for his soul.\" <br>In another Hadith, Hadhrat ZuLair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself narrates the incident. He says: <br>\"We rnade out a woman drawing near the place where <br>the martyrs of Uhud had been gathered. On her close <br>approach, I recognised her to be my own mother. I ad-<br>vanced to stop her, but she proved to be too strong for <br>me. She thrust me aside, with the words, 'Leave me <br>alone.' Whgn I told her that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had prohibited her from seeing the <br>dead body, she at once desisted from her purpose and <br>explained. \"Hearing the news of my brother's death, I <br>have brought a couple of sheets for his shroud. Take <br>these sheets and make use of them.' We took the sheets <br>and had begun to enshroud the body, when the dead <br>body of an Ansari named Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) caught our eyes. It was also lying close by <br>in the same condition. We considered it a shame to <br>enshroud Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) in two <br>sheets, while the body of another Muslim brother lay <br>bare. We, therefore, decided to use one sheet each for <br><br>0) <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>L.<br>O Q* <br>the two bodies. Now, one sheet was bigger than the <br>other, so we drew lots, and the bigger sheet came to the <br>9 m<br>* <br>lot of Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) and the <br>smaller one to that of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). We found that the sheet meant for Hadhrat <br>Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho), being too small, would <br>not cover his body: if we covered the head the feet re- <br>mained uncovered, and when we pulled it down to <br>cover the feet, the head was exposed. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Cover the head with <br>the sheet, and the feet with tree leaves.\" <br>This is how the body of Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), the dear uncle of him (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) who wore the crown of perfection, was buried. Look <br>at the spirit of the Sahabah, who could not tolerate Hadhrat <br>'Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) being enshrouded in two <br>sheets and another Muslim brother remaining without a <br>shroud at all. Again, although Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) deserved preferential treatment due to his <br>exalted position, his body was covered with a smaller sheet <br>that had fallen to his lot. Can there be a better example of <br>sympathy, equality and self-sacrifice? Is it not shameful on <br>our part that we, who call ourselves the followers of these <br>illustrious people, do not possess any of these qualities. <br>7. <br>The Story of the Goat's Head: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"One of the Sahabah received a goat's head as a pres- <br>ent. He thought of a neighbour who had a larger family <br>and was in greater need of it thar, himself, and pre- <br>sented the same to him. 'This brother, on receipt of the <br>present, recollected yet another person whom he con- <br>sidered even more deserving than himself, and sent on <br>the head to him. The goat's head is, thus, said to have <br>changed hands no less than seven times, and at last <br>came back to the original person from whom the circu- <br>lation had started.\" <br>We learn from the $tory how poor and needy the Saha- <br>bah usually were, and yet how they indeed preferred others <br>above themselves. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Urnar's (Radhiyallaho anho) wife acts as a <br>midwife: <br>Amir-ul-Mominin Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>during the time of his Khilafat, used to patrol the streets <br>and suburbs of Madinah himself during the night to keep a <br>watch. During one of his night-patrols, he noticed a camel- <br>hair tent pitched in an open space. He had never seen this <br>particular tent before. Approaching the tent, he found an <br>individual sitting outside, and heard a sort of groan coming <br>out of the tent. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) greeted <br>the stranger with \"Assalaam-o-alaikum\" and sat down <br>beside him. <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Whence brother?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I am from the desert, and a stranger to this place. I <br>have come to request Amir-ul-Momnin for some help <br>in my need.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Who is there groaning like this inside the tent?\" <br>The person: <br>\"Please mind your own business.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Do tell me please. May be that I can help you.\" <br>The Derson: <br>\"If you must know, inside there is my wife groaning <br>with labour pains.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Is there anybody else to attend her?\" <br>The person: <br>\"No one.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), thereupon, got up <br>and hurried homewards. He broached the subject to his <br>wife Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) thus: <br>\"Allah has brought you an opportunity to receive great <br>blessings.\" <br>Wife: <br>' <br>\"What is it, 0,Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br><br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yonder, a poor woman of the desert is in child birth, <br>with none to attend her.\" <br>Wife: <br>\"I am ready to attend her, if it may please you so.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) was after <br>all the daughter of Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>and grand-daughter of the Prophet; how could she hesitate <br>at the time of such need of a forlorn sister, such a service <br>and a devotion which Allah loves best? <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Then you should make all due haste. Also take a pan, <br>some butter, provisions and other things needed <br>during the child birth.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anho) did as she <br>was bidden and left for the place where the tent was <br>pitched. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) followed her <br>close. She entered the tent, while Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) made a fire and occupied himself with <br>cooking something which those people could eat. After <br>some time, Hadhrat Umme-Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>called out from inside the tent, <br>\"Amir-ul-Mominin, congratulate your friend on the <br>birth of a son.\" <br>The person was much embarrassed when he heard the ad- <br>dress of 'Amir-ul-Mominin' and realized the position of the <br>person who had been serving him. But Hadhrat 'Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) put all his fears to rest, saying: <br>\"That is all right, there is nothing to worry about.\" <br>He then placed the pan near the tent, asking his wife to <br>take it and feed the woman. She fed her and returned the <br>pan. Then Hadhrat U'mar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked the <br>bedouin to partake of the food, as he had kept awake the <br>whole night. <br>Having rendered this service, Hadhrat U'mar (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) returned home with his wife, telling the person <br>\"Come to me tomorrow, and I shall see what I can do for <br>you.\" <br>Is there any king, nay a petty chief, or even an ordinary <br>middle class person of our time, who will thus take his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>t <br>wife out at the dead of night, and out in the wilderness, to <br>attend a poor strange woman, while he himself gladly en- <br>gages in making a fire and cooking food. Leave the worldly <br>rich aside, how many of the religious people would do <br>that? We should realize that unless we really follow in the <br>footsteps of those God-fearing people whom we profess to <br>look up to as our models, we cannot deserve and wish for <br>the special blessings that Allah bestowed on them. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) gives his <br>garden to Allah: <br>I <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Abu Talhah <br>owned the best gardens in Madinah, and they were more <br>numerous than those of any other Ansari. One of his gar- <br>dens was known by the name of Bir I-Ia, and this was his <br>most favourite resort. It was close to the Prophet's (Sallal- <br>L <br>laho alaihe wasallam) musjid and the water of its well was <br>sw,eeR and abundant. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) often visited that garden, and drank of the water. <br>When Allah revealed the verse, <br>\"You will not attain unto piety until you spend of that <br>which Ye love (111: 92).\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) repaired to the <br>I<br>Prophet's presence and thus opened his heart, <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I love Bir Ha very much. As <br>Allah wants us toppend precisely that which we love, <br>I make over that garden to be spent in the path of Allah <br>as you please.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was very much <br>pleased, and remarked: <br>\"What a fine present (to Allah)! I think it would be <br>best utilized if you distribute it among your own <br>heirs.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and acted <br>upon the Prophet's advice. <br>. <br>Are we prepared to part with any of our dear things for <br>l<br>the sake of Allah so quickly, after reading a verse of the <br>I <br>Qur'an or listening to a well-delivered sermon? <br><br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>107 3,<br>Ll0%a <br>Even when we wish to make a charitable endowment, <br>.g 4<br>usually we do it only for our death-beds or else when we <br>s, <br>are so displeased with some relatives that we decide to dis- <br>inherit them. But, when an occasion of public spending <br>like marriage comes round, we are eager to win popularity <br>even if we have to take a loan on interest. <br>10. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) reprimands his <br>servant: <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) was well <br>known for his piety and abstinence. He kept no money <br>with him, and likewise did not like others to hosrd it. He <br>was always fighting against the moneyed class. Hadhrat <br>Usman, (Radhiyallaho anho), therefore, during his caliph- <br>ate advised him to shift to Rabzah (a small village in the <br>desert). He had a few camels to live on, and an old servant <br>to look after them. A tribesman from Banu Sulaim onca <br>presented himself with a request: <br>\"I wish to stay with you to benefit from your knowl- <br>edge of Allah's commandments and the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) ways and habits; I shall also <br>help your servant in looking after the camels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"I cannot keep with me a person who does not comply <br>with my wishes; but if you can always do as bidden, <br>you may remain with me, else I wish good-bye to you.\" <br>The person asked: <br>\"In what way do you like me to carry out your <br>wishes.\" <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"When I ask you to spend from my belongings, you are <br>required to spend the best of them.\" <br>The person says, \"I accepted Hadhrat Abuzar's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) condition and stayed on with him. One <br>day, somebody informed him that there were some poor <br>folk camping near the spring close-by and were in dire <br>need of food. He asked me to fetch a camel. Accordingly, I <br>went and intended to select the best of the lot, as I had <br>pledged to do. It was a very fine and submissive animal <br>and good for riding. so I decided to let it be, and selected <br>the second best, as after all it was only to be slaughtered <br>and eaten and, for this purpose, just as good as the other. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The other one was very good for riding and much more <br>useful to Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>family, while the poor would find the one as tasty as the <br>other. I, therefore, led the other camel to Hadhrat Abuzar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He retorted. <br>\"So, after all you have broken your pledge.\" <br>Knowing well what he meant, I turned back and fetched <br>the best camel instead. He addressed the people about him, <br>\"I want two persons to do a job for Allah.\" <br>As two persons volunteered themselves, he bade them go <br>and slaughter the camel, and distribute the meat equally <br>among the families camping near the water, including his <br>own, saying, \"My family will also share equally with the <br>rest.\" The volunteers carried out his instruct~ons. He then <br>sent for me and asked: <br>'Did you intentionally ignore my instructions about <br>spending the best out of my belongings, or you just <br>happened to forget about it?' <br>I: \t<br>'I did not forget you instructions, but thought it better <br>to preserve the one for transport duties, while the <br>other was as good for eating.' <br>Abuzar: 'Was it for my personal need that you left it?' <br>I: \t<br>'Yes.' <br>Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>'Come, let me tell you the occasion of my needs. That <br>is the day when I shall be laid all alone in the solitude <br>of the grave. Remember, there are three partners in <br>your wealth, viz. (1)Your destiny, which does not wait <br>to take away its share. Good or bad it would take away <br>all that it has to take. (2) Your heirs, who are waiting <br>for the day of your death, so that they may take over <br>their share, and (3) Yourself. If you can manage, don't <br>be the most helpless of the three partners. Take your <br>full share, while you can. Allah says: <br>'Ye will not attain unto piety until you spend of tnat <br>. \t<br>which you love. (111: 92). I, therefore, think it advisable <br>to send in advance the things which I love best, so that <br>they may be in safe deposit for me there.' <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>u <br>Ch. VI: Sympathy and Self-sacrifice <br>109 2%<br>0% <br>That man is the worst loser of the three partners who $4 <br>does not spend his wealth in the path of Allah, and keeps <br>Sv! <br>postponing the event till at last destiny takes it away from <br>him, or Re dies and his heirs appropriate it. It is very <br>seldom that the heirs give away in the path of Allah the <br>wealth inherited from another person, so that his soul may <br>benefit by it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>remarked: <br>\"Man cherishes his worldly belongings, hugging them <br>to his soul, and gloating, 'my wealth, my wealth,' but <br>in reality only that much of it is his wealth, which he <br>either enjoys in the form of food or dress or spends in <br>the path of Allah to be stored up for him in the Here- <br>after. What is left of his wealth belongs to others; he is <br>only acting as a custodian.\" <br>In another Hadith, it is reported that once the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired of the Sahabah. <br>\"Which of you would rather like to see his wealth in <br>the hands of his heirs than keep it with himself?\" <br>They replied: \"Who would like to be such a person, 0<br>Prophet of Allah? (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)\" <br>Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex-<br>plained: <br>\"Whatever you send in advance by spending it in the <br>path of Allah is yours, and whatever is left behind be- <br>longs to your heirs.\" <br>11. The Story of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far and Hadhrat <br>.Abdullah Bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma): <br>Hadhrat Ja'far Tayyar (Radhiyallaho anho) is a cousin <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a brother of <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). His whole family is re- <br>nowned for magnanimity, generosity, valour and heroism, <br>but Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) had a special love <br>for the poor and often mingled and associated with them. <br>He emigrated to Abyssinia with the other Muslims at the <br>time of the persecution by Qureysh, and he was the spokes- <br>man who so successfully defended the emigrants in the <br>court of the Negus. This story we have already given in <br>Chapter I. After returning from Abyssinia, he emigrated to <br>Madinah and was martyred in the expedition of Mootah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>On receiving the news of his death, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went to his house to coridole with his <br>family. He called his sons Abdullah, Aun and Muhammad <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum), consoled them and blessed them <br>with his prayers. All his sons were cast in the mould of <br>their father, but Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho acho) <br>was so generous and large-hearted that people called him <br>\"Qutbus Sakha\" (the chief of the generous). He embraced <br>Islam at the hands of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when he was barely seven. Once on his recommenda- <br>tion, his uncle Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) helped <br>some person in his need. The person sent four thousand <br>dirhams as a present to Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), but he returned the whole lot saying: <br>\"We people don't sell our good deeds.\" <br>Upon another occasion, somebody sent him two thousand <br>dirhams as a present: and he spent all of them in charity <br>there and then. A trader once happened to bring a large <br>quantity of sugar for sale in the market, but as chance <br>would have it, there was no demand for the commodity <br>just then and this grieved him very much. Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) purchased the whole lot through <br>his agent, and distributed it (free) among the people. He <br>always acted as a host to all the strangers who were <br>stranded in the city during the night. <br>Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), when participat- <br>ing in his last battle, called his son Hadhrat Abdullah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to his side and confided to him that he had <br>a premonition that this was going to be his last fight, in <br>which he was destiried to fall, adding that if it turned out <br>to be so, Hadhrat Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) was to <br>clear all his debts. He further admonished his son to call <br>upon his 'Master' if he encountered any difficulty in doing <br>so. His son, a bit puzzled, inquired as to who his Master <br>was? \"Allah,\" replied Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>The same day he met his fate. When Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) checked the accounts of his <br>father, he discovered debts that amounted to no less than <br>two million dirhams. Having the reputation of being as <br>honest and trustworthy a person as any that ever breathed, <br>people flocked to him for the safe deposit of their money. <br>He invariably address them like this: <br><br>Self-sacrifice<br>Ch. VI: Sympathy ~ n d  <br>8 <br>\"Dear brethren, I posses no vaults for the safe-keeping <br>of your deposits. I will treat them as loans to me, and <br>you may take the same back when you please.\" <br>He would then spend the money on the poor and the <br>needy. By and by, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) cleared all the debts of his father. He says: <br>\"Whenever I experienced any difficulty, I would pray <br>(to Allah) '0,Master of Zubair help me,' and the diffi- <br>culty would be removed.\" <br>He narrates an incident with Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) to whom he had gone on business. <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"I find from the accounts of my father that you owe <br>him one million dirham.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You can have the money when you please.\" <br>On checking the accounts once again, however, he <br>found that it was his mistake, and in fact this much money <br>was due to Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) from his father. He therefore went to him again and <br>said: <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Excuse me. It was my mistake. In fact my father owed <br>you that much money.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"If that is the case, I remit the debt.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"No, I must pay it.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"All right. You may pay it at your convenience.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Will you accept some land in lieu thereof? (He had re- <br>ceived some land as his share of booty. and he wanted <br>to dispose of it.\") <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Yes, if it suits you.\" <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). says, \"I <br>made over to him a piece of waterless land. He asked his <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>slave to go and spread his prayer-mat in that land. He then <br>went and said two rakaats of Salaat, spending a long time <br>in Sajdah. On finishing the Salaat, he pointed out a certain <br>spot to his slave, and ordered him to dig at that particular <br>place. After a little digging, water gushed forth from the <br>pit.\" <br>The qualities of the Sahabah mentioned in this Chap- <br>ter, were part of their every-day life. In fact, these things <br>were not considered to be anything unusual. <br><br>CHAPTER VII <br>VALOUR AND HEROISM <br>Fear of death was unknown to the Sahabah. They were <br>therefore most fearless and valorous. A person who can <br>look death in the face can meet all situations. There is left <br>for him no attraction in the wealth of this world, and no <br>fear of an enemy. I wish I could inherit this quality from <br>these true heroes. <br>1. \t Ibn Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) and Sa'd (Radhiyal- <br>laho d o )  Pray for Each Other: <br>On the eve'of Uhud, Abdullah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"0.Sa'd! come, let us pray together. Let each pray to <br>Allah for the grant of his sole desire, and the other <br>would say Ameen to it. This way, the praye:s are more <br>likely to be answered by Allah.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) agreed, and they both went to a <br>corner to pray. <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was first to pray, saying: <br>\"0,Allah, when the battle rages tomorrow, let me face <br>a very strong and fierce enemy. Let him attack me with <br>might and main, and let me repulse him with all my <br>strength. Then 0,Allah, let me be triumphant by kill- <br>ing him for your sake, and allow me to have his pos- <br>sessions as booty.\" <br>Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) said; \"Ameen .\" <br>Then Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anno) started his prayer, <br>saying: <br>\"0,Allah, let me face one of the toughest fighters <br>among the enemy tomorrow. Let him attack me with <br>full fury and let me attack him with my full strength. <br>Then let him have the upper hand and kill me. lie may <br>cut my nose and ears from my body. And when I <br>appear before You on the day of Judgement, You may <br>ask me, 'How did you lose your nose and ears, 0,Ab-<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>dullah!,' to which I may reply, 'These were lost in the <br>way of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).' Then You will say, 'Yes! surely these were lost <br>in My way.' \" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Ameen. <br>In the battle field next day, both of the Sahabah saw <br>their prayers answered exactly as they had asked. Sa'd <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah's prayer was better than mine. In the even- <br>ing I noticed his ears and nose strung in a thread.\" <br>This story on the one hand depicts great chivalry and <br>valour on the part of Sahabah, in as much as they were <br>anxious to face the brave and the strong amongst the <br>enemy, and on the other hand it shows their devotion and <br>love for Allah. Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) wishes Allah <br>to confirm on the Day of Judgement that his sacrifice was <br>really for Allah's cause. What an excellent wish! <br>2. Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) valour in Uhud: <br>Neglect of the Prophet's orders changed the victory at <br>Uhud into a defeat, the details of which we have already <br>seen in Chapter I. That was a very hard time for the Mus- <br>lims. They were simply caught between the two groups of <br>the enemy, and many were killed. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was surrounded by the enemy, who <br>spread the rumour that he had died. Most of the Sahabah <br>lost their balance of mind at this rumour, and that was the <br>main cause of their c6nfusion. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were surrounded by the enemy, and I could not <br>see the Prophet (sallalaho alaihe wasallam). I first sea- <br>rched for him among the living and then among the <br>I <br>dead, but I could not find him. I said to myself, 'It is <br>impossible for him to fly from the battle-field. It seems <br>that Allah is angry with us due to our sins, and He has <br>lifted him up to the heavens. There is no way left for <br>me except to jump into the enemy lines and fight till I <br>am killed.' I therefore attacked the enemy, clearing <br>them with my sword till I caught sight of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); I was very happy and was <br>sure that Allah had been protecting him through His <br><br>angels. I approached him and stood by his side. Mean- <br>while an enemy contingent advanced to attack the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said to me, <br>'Ali go and check them.' I fought and repulsed them <br>single-handed, killing quite a few of them. After this, <br>yet another group came to attack him. He again called <br>out, 'Ali go and check them.' I fought with that group <br>again single-handed and put them to their heels.' \" <br>It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihe <br>salaam) came and praised Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>for his valour and his devotion to the Prophet. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Ali belongs to me and I belong to him.\" <br>At this, Hadhrat Jibrail (Alaihis salaam) remarked: <br>&ui; <br>\"I belong to you both.\" <br>Look at the valour of Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He jumps into the enemy lines singlehanded, when he is <br>unable to find the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>This also shows his extreme love and devotion to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>3. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anhoj is martyred <br>When the battle of Uhud started, Hadhrat Hanzalah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had just been wedded and therefore <br>did not join the battle from the beginning. It is said that he <br>had just left the bed of his wife and had hardly started <br>taking his bath, when he heard somebody breaking the <br>news about the defeat. He postponed the bath and, with <br>sword in hand, rushed towards the battle-field. He jumped <br>into the enemy concentration, fighting and penetrating till <br>he was killed. Now the body of the person killed in the <br>path of Allah is not washed, unless a bath has been incum- <br>bent on him before his death. Not knowing his failure to <br>take the bath incumbent on him, the Sahabah buried him <br>without a wash. Just before his burial, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I see the angels washing Hanzalah's body.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Sa'di (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"On hearing this from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I went to have a look at Hanzalah's face and <br>I noticed drops of water trickling down his hair.\" <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned to <br>Madinah, he made queries and the facts of Hadhrat Hanza- <br>lah's (Radhiyallaho anho) postponing his bath came to <br>light. <br>This, again, shows the valour of those people. A brave <br>person cannot tolerate any delay and jumps into the jaws of <br>death. Hadhrat Hanzalah (Radhiyallaho anho) also could <br>not wait to finish the bath incumbent on him. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Jamooh's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>desire for martyrdom. <br>'Amr bin Jamooh (Radhiyallaho anho) was lame. He <br>had four sons, who often remained in the company of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took part in the <br>campaigns. In Uhud, Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) desired <br>very much to join the battle. People said to him: <br>\"You ar excusable, as you are lame. You need not go <br>to the battle.\" <br>He replied: \t \"How sad! that my sons go to Paradise, and I <br>stay behind.\" <br>His wife also wanted him to fight and get martyred, so that <br>she might have the honour of being the widow of a martyr. <br>To exhort him, she said to him: <br>\"I do not believe that people have stopped you from <br>going. It seems that you are yourself afraid to go to the <br>battlefield.\" <br>Hearing this, Hadhrat 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) equipped <br>himself with arms and, facing Qiblah, prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>He then went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said: <br>\"I had always wished for martyrdom, but my people <br>have always been stopping me from going into the <br><br>battle. 0, Prophet of Allah! I cannot resist my desire <br>any more. Do permit me to join the battle. I hope to <br>walk in Paradise with my lame foot.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: <br>\"You have an excuse. There is no harm if you stay <br>behind.\" <br>But he still insisted, and at last the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) permitted him to fight. Hadhrat Abu <br>Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I saw 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) fighting. He walked <br>proudly and said, 'By Allah! I am fond of Paradise'. <br>One of his sons was following him at his heels. The <br>father and the son fought till both of them were <br>killed.\" . <br>His wife on hearing of the death of her husband and <br>son, came with a camel to fetch their bodies. It is said that <br>when the bodies were loaded on the camel, it refused to <br>stand up. When it was made to stand up after great beating, <br>it would not go to Madinah and would turn towards Uhud, <br>again and again. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was informed of this, he said: <br>\"The camel is charged to do that. Did 'Amr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) say anything at the time of leaving his <br>home?\" <br>His wife informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that he had prayed to Allah, facing Qiblah: <br>\"0,Allah! Let me not come back to my family again.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"This is why the camel is refusing to go toward his <br>home.\" <br>Look at Hadhrat 'Amr's (Radhiyallaho anho) desire to <br>die in the path of Allah. It was their lova and devotion for <br>Allah and His Prophet that led the Sahabah to the height of <br>such attainment. Even after death, 'Amr (RadhiyaHaho <br>anho) wants to remain in the battle-field, and the camel re- <br>fused to take his body back to Madinah. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair [Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>been brought up with great love and affection by his well- <br>to-do parents. Before embracing Islam, he lived in luxury <br>and comfort. It is said that he was the most well-dressed <br>youth of Mecca. In fact his parents would buy a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams for him. He embraced Islam in <br>its early days, without the knowledge of his parents. When, <br>however, they came to know of it, they tied him with a <br>rope and compelled him to stay at home. He got an oppor- <br>tunity to escape and emigrated to Abyssinia. On return <br>from Abyssinia, he emigrated again to Madinah. So a <br>person like him, brought up in luxury and comfort, was <br>now living a life of abstinence and austerity. Once the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was sitting when <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) passed in front of him. He had <br>only one sheet of cloth to clothe his body, and this bore a <br>number of patches, including one of leather. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with tears in his eyes men- <br>tioned Mus'ab's life of luxury before Islam. In the battle of <br>Uhud, Musab (Radhiyallaho anho) held the flag of Islam. <br>When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in <br>confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. <br>An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the <br>flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at <br>once took the flag in the other hand. The enemy then cut <br>the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with the <br>help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his <br>body with an arrow. He fell dead and, with him fell the flag <br>that he had not allowed to fall while he was alive. Another <br>Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, <br>he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too <br>short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the <br>feet would be exposed, and when it was drawn to cover the <br>feet, the head would become uncovered. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Cover his head with the sheet, and his feet with 'Azk-<br>har'leaves.\" <br>Such was the end of the youth who was brought up in <br>luxury and comfort. The person who used to wear a dress <br>worth two hundred dirhams does not have sufficient cloth <br>to cover his dead body. Look! With what valour he tried to <br><br>keep the flag up, and did not allow it to fall till he was <br>dead. This is the miracle of Imaan. Once Imaan gets into a <br>person, it makes him forget everything else, whether <br>wealth, luxury or life itself. <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Sa'd's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) epistle to <br>Rustam. <br>In the Iraq expedition, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) wanted to lead the army himself. There were, on sev- <br>eral days, deliberations separately among the common <br>people and among the chiefs, whether Amir-ul-Mominin <br>should lead the expedition or stay in Madinah to direct the <br>operations and arrange reinforcements from the headquar- <br>ters. The common people were in favour of the former, and <br>the chiefs in favour of the latter alternative. Somebody <br>mentioned the name of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) as a substitute for Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to command the expedition. <br>Both the groups agreed, and it was decided that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) should lead the expedition <br>and Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) should stay behind <br>in Madinah. Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was very <br>brave and considered to be one of the heroes of Arabia. Iraq <br>was a part of the Persian Empire and Yazdjard was the Em- <br>peror at that time. He sent for one of his best generals <br>named Rustam and charged him with the task of checking <br>the Muslim advance. Rustam tried to avoid going to the <br>front, because of the fear of the Muslims, and requested the <br>Emperor again and again to keep him back, saying: <br>\"I shall make arrangements for the despatch of re-<br>inforcements and shall be of use to your Majesty at the <br>time of counsel.\" <br>But the Emperor did not agree, and he had to go to the <br>battlefield. <br>When Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was about to <br>leave Madinah, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gave <br>him the following instructions: <br>\"0,Sa'd! Let this fact not beguile you that you are one <br>of the trusted companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and that people call you his uncle. <br>Allah does not repel evil with evil, but He repels evil <br>with good. Allah has no relation with His creation. All <br>s<br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>men, high and low, are equal before Him, for all are <br>His creation and He is their sole Lord. One can win His <br>favours only through devotion to His service. Remem- <br>ber that the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is the only correct way of doing things. You <br>are going on a very heavy task. This you can discharge <br>only by following the truth. Inculcate good habits in <br>yourself and your companions. Choose fear of Allah as <br>your chief asset, for this will lead you to His obedience <br>and prevent you from His disobedience. Obedience to <br>Allah's commarld is the lot of those alone who hate <br>this world and love the Hereafter.\" <br>Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) faced the heavy odds with <br>full confidence in Allah. When both the armies were ready <br>to fight, he sent an epistle to Rustam, which read: <br>r<br>4,+ql <br>de.& <br>& &$\\ b e g  G9 .& ;$ <br>. -<br>\"Rustam! there are people with me to whom death (in <br>the path of Allah) is more attractive than is wine to the <br>people in your army.\" <br>Ask the people who are addicted to liquor, how much <br>they love to taste it. The Sahabah loved to meet death in <br>the Path of Allah even more. This was the chief cause of <br>their success. <br>7. \t Hadhrat Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) gets <br>martyred. <br>Wahb bin Qabus (Radhiyallaho anho) was a shepherd <br>and had been a ~usl\"lm for some time. He lived in his vil- <br>lage in the desert. He came to Madinah to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was accompanied by his <br>nephew and his herd of goats, which he had tied with a <br>rope. He learnt that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was in Uhud. He left his goats and went to Uhud to <br>fight by the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). A group of the enemy was at that time advancing to <br>attack the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet announced: <br>b <br>\"The person who disperses these people will be my <br>companion in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) attacked them fiercely <br>and repulsed all of them. A second and third group of the <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>121 2 3  <br>0s<br>I<br>enemy tried to advance, and each time it was Hadhrat <br>.gs<br>Wahb (Radhiyallaho anho) who fought them and put them <br>$ g<br>m<br>to flight single handed. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) gave him good tidings of Paradise. No sooner did <br>he hear this, than he jumped into the enemy lines and <br>fought till he was no more. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I have never seen a person fighting so bravely and <br>fearlessly as Wahb did. I saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) standing beside his dead body, <br>saying, '0Wahb! You have pleased me. May Allah be <br>pleased with you.\" <br>Although the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself <br>was wounded in this battle, yet he buried Wahb's body <br>with his own hands. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to say: <br>\"I never envied anybody more than Wahb (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho). I wish I could appear before Allah with a <br>record as good as his.\" <br>What is it in the life of Hadhrat Wahb (Radhivallaho <br>anho) that makes an illustrious and exalted person like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to envy him. It is the <br>same spirit of sacrifice for the sake of Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even though Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and other Sahabah have better <br>deeds. <br>8. \t<br>Tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona. <br>In the tragedy of Bi'r Ma'oona, seventy Sahabah were <br>massacred. All of them were Hafiz of Qur'an. Their Jama'at <br>was called the Jama'at of Qwaa and consisted mostly of <br>Ansaar. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) loved them <br>very much, for they engaged themselves in Zikr and recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an during the night, and attended upon the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his family during <br>the day. A person named Amir bin Malik and known as <br>Abu Bara, belonging to Bani Amir clan of Najd, came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and took this Jama'at <br>with him for the Tabligh and the Ta'leem of his clan. The <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>? <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) expressed his appre- <br>hensions, saying: <br>\"I fear some harm may come to my Sahabah.\" <br>But the person assured him that he was personally respon- <br>sible for their safety. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after much hesitation, agreed to send the Jama'at of <br>seventy Sahabah with him. He also gave them an epistle to <br>'Amir bin Tufail (the head of the clan), inviting him to <br>Islam. <br>These Sahabah camped at Bi'r Ma'oona. Hadhrat <br>'Umar bin Umayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadhrat <br>Munzir bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) took the camels for <br>grazing and Hadhrat Haraam (Radhiyallaho anho) with two <br>companions went to deliver the Prophet's epistle to 'Amir <br>bin Tufail. On reaching near his place, Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) said to his companions: <br>\"You both stay here, I shall go alone to him. If 1 am <br>safe, you mav also come after me, but if I am betrayed <br>you may return from here, as the loss of one is better <br>than of three.\" <br>'Amir bin Tufail was the nephew of 'Amir bin Malik, who <br>had brought the Jama'at. He was a bitter enemy of Islam <br>and hated the Muslims to the core. When Hadhrat Haraam <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) delivered the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) epistle to him, he did not even care to <br>read it and attacked Hadhrat Haraam (Kadhiyallaho anho) <br>with his spear, which pierced through the latter's body. <br>Hadhrat Haraam (RadHiyallaho anho) uttered \"By the Lord <br>of the Ka'bah, I have triumphed,\" and died. The heartless <br>person had no consideration for the guarantee given by his <br>uncle, nor for the accepted tradition all over the world, that <br>nobody would kill the envoy. He then assembled the <br>people of his clan and exhorted them to kill all the Saha- <br>bah camping at Bi'r Ma'oona. The people hesitated, in view <br>of the guarantee given by 'Amir bin Malik. He collected a <br>large number of people from the neighbouring tribes and <br>attacked the Muslims. They massacred each one of them, <br>except Hadhrat Ka'b bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>had some life left in him and the enemy left him as dead. <br>Hadhrat <br>Munzir <br>and <br>Hadhrat <br>Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), while grazing the camels, noticed vultures hover- <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>ing in the air. They exclaimed. 'Something foul has hap- <br>pened, and returned to the camp. They saw from some <br>distance that their companions were dead and the murder- <br>ers were standing around their bodies with bloody swords <br>in their hands. They stopped a while to think what they <br>might do. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: <br>\"Let us go back to Madinah and inform the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>~ a d h r a t  Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) did not agree. He <br>said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will get the <br>information sooner or later. I do not like to miss mar- <br>tyrdom and run away from the place where our com- <br>panions are lying in their peaceful sleep. Let us go <br>forward apd meet them.\" <br>They both went and jumped into the thick of battle. Hadh- <br>rat Munzir (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed and Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was captured. As 'Amir's <br>mother had to set free a slave in connection with some vow <br>that she had made, 'Amir set Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) free and let him go. 'Amir bin Fuhairah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), a slave of Abu Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho), was <br>also among those who were killed at Bi'r Ma'oona. Jabbar <br>bin Salmi, who killed him says: <br>When I thrust my spear through him, he uttered, 'By <br>Allah, I have triumphed and to my amazement I saw <br>his body lifted upwards towards the sky. I made enqui- <br>ries later on as to what was the triumph that 'Amir bin <br>Fuhairah (Radhiyallaho anho) meant when he uttered, <br>'By Allah, I have triumphed.' I was told that it was that <br>of entering into Paradise. This made me embrace <br>Islam. <br>These are the illustrious people, of whom Islam is <br>rightly proud. Death had really more attraction for them <br>than wine for their enemies. As they did deeds which were <br>sure to win Allah's pleasure, they felt most triumphant at <br>the time of surrendering their souls. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up Eating <br>Dates. <br>In Badr, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>sitting in a tent. He exhorted the Sahabah to fight, saying: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Rise up and race one with another for a Paradise as <br>wide as are the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for <br>the Muttaqin.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair ibnul Humaam (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>also listening to this. He exlaimed: <br>\"Bakh! Bakh! (How wonderful).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) what he rneant by that exclama- <br>tion. <br>He said: \"I wish to be one of those for whom this Paradise <br>has been prepared.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Rest assured, you are one of them.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) then took out a few <br>dates from his bag and began to eat. While he was eating, <br>he suddenly said: <br>\"To wait till the dates finish will be a very long time. I <br>cannot do that.\" <br>Saying this, he threw away the dates, and with sword in <br>hand jumped into the battle-field and fought till he was <br>killed. <br>In fact, these people appreciated the value of Paradise, <br>for their Yaqeen was firm. If we too get that Yaqeen in our <br>hearts, nothing will be too difficult or too much for us. <br>10. \t Hadhrat 'Umar's IRadhiyallaho anho) Emigration to <br>Madinah. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) is well known for <br>his valour and heroism by one and all. When the Muslims <br>were very weak in the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) prayed to Allah to strengthen the Mus- <br>lims with Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Islam. This <br>prayer was answered by Allah in no time, as we have seen <br>in Chapter I. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma'sood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"We could not say our Salaat in the Haram till %mar <br>had accepted Islam.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>I \t<br>! <br>I <br>i \t<br><br>\"Early emigrants to Madinah left Mecca quietly and <br>secretly, due'to the fear of Qureysh. But when Hadhrat <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to emigrate, he <br>hung his sword from his neck, held his bow in his <br>hand and took a large number of arrows with him. He <br>first went to Haram, performed Tawaf most confi-<br>dently, said his Salaat most calmly and then went to <br>the different groups of Quereysh, declaring before each <br>of them, \"Whoso does not mind his mother lamenting <br>him, his wife becoming a widow and his children <br>being rendered orphans, he may come out of Mecca <br>and face me'. There was none to accept his challenge.\" <br>11. \t Expedition to Moota. <br>Of the epistles that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) despatched to various kings, inviting them to Islam, <br>one was sent to the King of Busra through Hadhrat Haris <br>bin Umair Azdi. When Hadhrat Haris (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Moota, he was killed by Sharjeel Ghassani, one of <br>the governors of Caesar. The murder of the envoy was <br>against all laws of inter-tribal morality. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was naturally very much upset when <br>the news reached him. He collected an army, 3 000-strong, <br>to advance against the enemy. While nominating Hadhrat <br>Zaid bin Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) to command the <br>army, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"If Zaid is killed, then Ja'far bin Abi Talib will be your <br>Amir and if he is also martyred, then Abdullah bin Ra- <br>wahah will take the command. If he also dies, then you <br>can select a commander from among yourselves.\" <br>A Jew, who was listening to this, said: <br>\"All the three must die. This is exactly how the earlier <br>Prophets used to prophesy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave Hadhrat <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) a white flag made by himself. He <br>then accompanied the army for some distance out of Madi- <br>nah and prayed for them saying: <br>\"May Allah bring you back safely and triumphantly. <br>May He guard you against all evils.\" <br>At that moment, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was o poet too. recited three couplets. <br>which meant: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"I only wish forgiveness of my sins and a sword to <br>cause my blood to gush out like water from a fountain. <br>Or a spear to pierce me through my liver and my stom- <br>ach. And when people pass my grave they say: <br>'May you, who have died for Allah's cause, <br>Triumph and prosper. You are really triumphant and <br>prosperous.\" <br>Sharjeel received the intelligence about this army. He <br>prepared himself to meet them with an army, 100 000- <br>strong. When they proceeded further, they heard the <br>rumour that the Caesar himself was coming with another <br>army of 100 000-men to help Sharjeel. The Sahabah hesi- <br>tated whether they should face such heavy odds or inform <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for further instruc- <br>tions. At this Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) called aloud: <br>\"Friends! what are you bothering about? What are you <br>here for? You are here to be martyred. We have never <br>fought by dint of our strength in arms and numbers. <br>We have always fought on the score of Islam, through <br>which Allah has exalted us. You are sure of one of the <br>two triumphs: Victory or Martyrdom.\" <br>Thus exhorted by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Rawahah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the Sahabah decided to advance till <br>they faced the Christian army in the battle-field of Moota. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with flag in his hand di- <br>rected the field operations. A fierce battle raged; Sharjeel's <br>brother was killed in action. Sharjeel himself fled from the <br>field and took shelter in a fort. He sent a message to the <br>Caesar, who immediately despatched for his help and an <br>army, which was 200 000-strong. The Muslims were fight- <br>ing against very heavy odds. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was killed and the flag was taken over by Hadhrat <br>Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho). He intentionally disabled his <br>horse to dispel any idea of returning home from the battle- <br>field. He then recited a few couplets, which meant: <br>\"0,people! What a beautiful place is Paradise. And <br>how happy is its approach! How fine and how cool is <br>its water. The Roman's doom is at hand, I must finish <br>them all.\" <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>With flag in one hand and sword in the other, he jumped .$<br>into the enemy lines. The enemy cut his right hand, which 8~<br>held the flag. He at once transferred it to his left. When that <br>was cut off, he held the flag in his teeth and supported it <br>with his bleeding arms. His body was cut into two by <br>somebody from behind and fell dead. He was thirty-three at <br>that time. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When we removed him from the battle-field, we <br>counted as many as ninety wounds on his body--all <br>on the front side.\" <br>When Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Rawahah (Radhiyallaho anho) was eating <br>a piece of meat in a corner of the battle-field. He had been <br>hungry for three days. On hearing about Hadhrat Ja'far's <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) death, he threw away that piece of <br>meat, saying to himself: <br>\"Abdullah! You are busy in eating. while Ja'far has <br>reached Paradise.\" <br>He took the flag and began to fight. His finger was severely <br>injured and hung loose. He put the hanging finger under <br>his foot and tore it off from the hand, and then rushed for- <br>ward. Knowing the Muslims were fighting against very <br>overwhelming odds, and his own weakness, made him <br>pause for a moment. He at once recovered from his despair <br>and said to himself: <br>\"0, Heart! what makes you tarry now? Is it for the love <br>of wife? If so, then I divorce her this very moment. Is it <br>for the slaves? Then I set them all free. Is it for the <br>garden? I give it over in Sadaqah. He then recited a few <br>couplets, which meant: '0,Abdullah! You have to go <br>down after all; whether you do it willingly or unwil- <br>lingly. You have had enough of peace. 0,you, who are <br>only a drop of dirty fluid! See how the disbelievers are <br>assaulting the Muslims. Why does Paradise not entice <br>you? Even if you are not killed in this battle, remem- <br>ber, you have to die one day.\" <br>He then got down from his horse. Meanwhile his cousin <br>brought him a slice of meat, sayin \"You have had neither <br>sleep nor food for so many days. %at thiranrftake a little <br>rest before you fight.\" He held the slice and was about to <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>eat it when he heard an uproar of the enemy's assault from <br>one direction. He threw away the slice and jumped into the <br>crowd, striking with his sword till he was killed. <br>The history of the Sahabah is full of episodes, which <br>show that worldly pleasures were most insignificant in <br>their eyes, and their only concern was to get success in the <br>Hereafter. <br>12. The Story of Saeed bin Jubair and Hajjaj Bin Yusuf. <br>We see the same spirit even in their successors (the Ta- <br>bi'ees). I close this chapter with an account of Saeed bin <br>Jubair, who is famous Tabi'ee. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>du <br>#-&<br>$& <br>I<br>2w\\ \t<br>r! <br>. . <br>\"To utter truth in the face of a tyrant is the best Jihad.\" \t<br>This is a story of Jihad of that type. At that time, Hajjaj bin <br>Yusuf, the notorious blood-shedder was in power. Hajjaj's <br>harshness and tyranny are well known in human history. <br>The rulers in those days, in spite of their shortcomings, <br>never lagged behind in propagating the faith, yet we treat <br>them as the worst among rulers because of the contrast <br>with the just and God-fearing rulers. He was the viceroy of <br>king Abdul Malik bin Marwan for Hijaz and Iraq. The king <br>lived in Damascus and Hajjaj had his headquarters at <br>Koofah. Saeed bin Jubair had fought against Hajjaj on the <br>side of Ibnul Ash-ath. After the defeat. Saeed (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) ran away and took asylum in Mecca. The Govern- <br>ment posted a very stern person as the Governor of Mecca, <br>with instructions to'arrest Saeed. The Governor assembled <br>all the people of Mecca and read before them the order of <br>Abdul Malik, which said: <br>\"Any person who gives shelter to Hadhrat Saeed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) shall meet the same fate as Hadhrat <br>Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) himself.\" <br>He then announced to the people: <br>\"By Allah, I must kill the person who gives shelter to <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullah alaih). His and his neigh- <br>bours houses shall be razed to the ground.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was arrested with great <br>difficulty and sent to Koofah. When he was brought before <br>Hajjaj, the following conversation took place: <br><br>Ch. VII:, Valour and Heroism <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My name is Saeed (lit. auspicious).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What is your father's name?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Jubair (lit. Trimmed).\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"No, you are in fact Shaqi (lit. wretched) <br>son of Kusair (lit. a broken thing).\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"My mother knew my name better than <br>you do.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"You are wretched and your mother is also <br>wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The Knower of the hidden things is <br>Hajjaj: <br>-<br>someone else\" <br>\"Look! I am putting you to sword.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Then my mother was right in giving me <br>this name.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I shall send you to Hell.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"If I knew that you had that power. <br>would have taken you as my god.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"What is your belief about the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"He was an apostle of Mercy and a <br>Prophet of Allah, sent'with the best Guid- <br>ance for the whole creation.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"What do you say about the Khalifas?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not a warder over them. Everybody <br>is responsiLle for his own actions.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Who is the most exalted of the four Khali- <br>. fahs?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The one who had been able to please <br>. Allah more than the rest.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Which of them had 'been able to please <br>Allah more than the rest?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"This is known only to Him Who knows <br>what is hidden in the bosoms and what <br>the hearts conceal.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Is Ali in Paradise or in Hell?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"I can answer only after I visit the two <br>places and meet their dwellers.\" <br>\"How shall I fare on the Day of Judge-<br>Hajjaj: <br>ment?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am not fit to receive the knowledge of <br>the unseen?\" <br>\"You do not intend to tell me the truth.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \t \"But I did not tell a lie either.\" <br>\"Why do you never laugh?\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do not see anything to laugh at; and <br>indeed why should one laugh, who is cre- <br>ated from dust, who has to appear on the <br>Day of Judgement, and is always sur-<br>rounded by tribulations. <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"But I do laugh.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah has created us with different tem- <br>peraments.\" <br>\"I am now going to kill you.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"The time and mode of my death have <br>already been decreed.\" <br>~ a j j a j  <br>\"Allah has preferred me to you.\" <br>f <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Nobody can be proud of his relation with <br>Allfh, unless he knows his position; and <br>Allah is the only knower of the unseen.\" <br>\"Why should I not be proud of my relation <br>Hajjaj: <br>with Allah, when I am with the Amir-ul- <br>Mominin and you are with the rebels.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I am with the other Muslims. I myself <br>shun mischief, but nobody can change the <br>decree of Allah.\" <br>\"What do y0.u say about what we collect <br>Hajjaj: <br>for Amir-ul-Mominin?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I do-not know what you collect for him.\" <br>Hajjaj sent for gold, silver and dresses fiom the trea- <br>sury and showed these to Saeed. <br><br>Ch. VII: Valour and Heroism <br>131 sc <br>%2 <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"These are useful, provided you are able to <br>obtain with them the things that may pro- <br>-84 <br>$,<br>vide you peace on the Day of Consterna- <br>tion (i.e Day of Judgement), when every <br>nursing mother will forget her nursing, <br>and every pregnant one will be delivered <br>of her burden, and when nothing but good <br>will be of any avail.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Are our collections not good?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"You have collected them, and you are the <br>best judge.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Do you like any of these things for your- <br>self?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"I only like the things which Allah likes.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Woe to you!\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Woe is for the person who is deprived of <br>Paradise and is made to enter Hell.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>(Annoyed): \"Say how should I kill you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"As you would like to be killed.\" <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Should I forgive you?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Allah's forgiveness is real. Your aforgive- <br>ness is of no value.\" <br>Hajjaj: <br>(To the executioner): \"Kill this man.\" <br>Hadhrat, Saeed laughed while he was being taken for <br>execution. Hajjaj was informed of this. He called him back. <br>\"What made you laugh?\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Your boldness with Allah, and His,clem- <br>ency to you. \" <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"I am killing a person who has caused dis- <br>sent among the Muslims. (To the ex-<br>ecutioner) Kill him in front of me.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: \"Let me say my Salaat of two rakaats.\" <br>After finishing Salaat, he faced Qiblah and recited: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who cre- <br>ated the heavens and earth, as one by nature upright, <br>and I am not of the idolaters\" <br>(VI:80). <br>Hajjaj: \t<br>\"Turn him from our Qiblah and let him <br>face the Qiblah of the Christians, who also <br>caused dissension and dispute among <br>their community.\" <br>His face was immediately turned to the other direction. <br>Hadhrat Saeed: <br>\"And wither-so-ever you turn, there is Allah's count- <br>enance\" (11: 115). Who is knower of the hidden <br>thoughts. <br>\"Make him lie on his face. We are only re- <br>Hajjaj: <br>sponsible for appearance.\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed (Rahmatullahi alaih) was made to lie on his <br>face. <br>Saeed: <br>\"Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return <br>you, and thqnce We bring you forth a second time.\" <br>(XX:55). <br>Hajjaj: <br>\"Kill him\" <br>Hadhrat Saeed: I call you to witness what I recite: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, who <br>is all alone and Who has no partner and I bear witness <br>that Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is His <br>slave and His Prophet.\" <br><br>He was then beheaded (Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaj-oon). <br>After the execution, too much blood came out from <br>Hadhrat Saeed's (Rahmatullahi alaih) body. Hajjaj himself <br>marvelled greatly at it. He inquired the reason from his <br>doctors, who said:- <br>\"His tranquillity and composure at the time of death <br>had kept his blood in its original form. Generally, <br>people to be executed are so much scared and afraid of <br>death that their blood curdles and does not flow pro- <br>fusely.\" <br>There are many such incidents in the annals of the <br>Taabi'een. Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa, Hadhrat Imam <br>Malik, Hadhrat Imam Ahmad bin Hambal and other div- <br>ines had to undergo trials and tribulations because of their <br>truthfulness; but they remained steadfast in the righteous <br>path. <br><br>CHAPTER-VIII <br>ZEAL FOR KNOWLEDGE <br>The Kalimah is the essence of Islam and the basis for <br>all achievements. No good action is acceptable with out <br>belief in Kalimah. The Sahabah, therefore, devoted most of <br>their energy, specially in the early days of Islam, to the <br>propagation of the Kalimah and to fighting with the forces <br>that resisted it. Although their engagements left them very <br>little time to drink deep from the ocean of learning with the <br>single-mindedness demanded thereof, yet their zeal even in <br>this direction has left us a legacy in the form of knowledge <br>about the Qur'an and Hadith, which is quite highly credita- <br>ble and a glaring example. When Sahabah go) a little lei- <br>sure from the work that kept them engtiged in the <br>beginning of Islam, and also when the number of people in <br>Islam grew considerably. Allah revealed the following <br>verse in the Qur'an: <br>\"And the believers should not all go out (in the path of <br>Allah). Of every group of them, a party only should go <br>forth that they (who are left behind) may gain sound <br>knowledge in feligion and that they may warn their <br>folk when they come to them, so that they may <br>beware.\" <br>(IX: 122). <br>Hadhrat ~bdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The verses of the Qur'an which were revealed in the <br>beginning of Islam, demanding every Muslim to move <br>out in the path of Allah; for example: <br>\"If you go not forth, He will afflict you with a painful <br>doom; <br>(IX:39)\" <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>'Go forth, light and heavily armed, and strive with f 3  <br>your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah; <br>s m  <br>m<br>(IX:41).' <br>These verses were later on superceded by the foregoing <br>verse, which advised only a party from each group to leave <br>their places. <br>The Sahabah, very few in number as they were, had to <br>assume the responsibilities of Islam in all fields. Allah <br>therefore endowed them with the versatility that was <br>theirs. After the Sahabah, the Islam spread far and wide <br>and the Mu~lims swelled in number. Again, the later <br>people lacked the versatility of the Sahabah. Allah then <br>caused different people to specialize in different branches <br>of Islamic learning. Mohaddit.hin were to devote them- <br>selves to the collection and propagation of Hadith. Simi- <br>larly the Fuqaha (jurists) Soofia (Experts in Zikr), Qurraa <br>(Experts in recitation of Qur'an), Mujahidin (Fighters in the <br>path of Allah), etc, each own group had its own field to <br>take up as a whole-time task. This was very necessary at <br>that time, for otherwise different branches of Islamic learn- <br>ing would not have developed so nicely, as it is difficult for <br>one man to specialize in all the branches. The Prophets <br>(alaihimus salaam), and specially Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) the chief among them, were specially en- <br>dowed with such a capacity. This will explain why the <br>stories of other eminent personalities, besides the Sahabah <br>have also been narrated in this chapter. <br>1. Sahabah's Panel for Fatwa. <br>Although all the Sahabah, along with their engagement <br>in Jihad and propagation of faith, were devoted to acquir- <br>ing and further spreading of knowledge, yet there was a <br>panel of Sahabah who were exclusively entrusted with <br>Fatwa, even during the life tirne of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). The panel comprised the following Saha- <br>bah:-<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr, Hadhrat 'Umar, Hadhrat Usman, <br>Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf. Hadhrat <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>IJbayy bin Kaab, Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Hadhrat <br>Ma'aaz bin Jabal, Hadhrat Ammaar bin Yaasir, Hadhrat Hu- <br>zaifah, Hadhrat Salman Farsi, Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit, <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum). <br>To give Fatwa during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) was a big privilege for these Saha- <br>bah, and speaks of their deep and dependable knowledge. <br>2. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) burns his col- <br>lections: <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"My father (Hadhrat Abu Bakr) (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had a collection of five hundred Hadiths. One night I <br>noticed that he was very restless. He was tossing about <br>in the bed and could not sleep. I got worried over this <br>and inquired, 'Are you suffering from any trouble or <br>worried about anything.' But he did not speak and re- <br>mained restless throughout the night. Next morning he <br>called me and said, 'Bring the collection of Hadith that <br>I gave you to keep.' I brought the book and he set fire <br>to it, till it was burnt. He said, 'The collection con- <br>tained many Hadiths that I had heard from other <br>people. I thought if I died and left behind a Hadith ac- <br>cepted as authentic by me, but really not so, then I <br>should have to answer for that.\" <br>It was Hadhrat Abu Bakr's (Radhiyallaho anho) zeal for <br>knowledge, that cau2ed him to compile a book of five hun- <br>dred Hadiths. But it was due to his extreme cautiousness <br>that he burnt the collection. <br>The Sahabah were very careful and cautious about <br>Hadith. That is why you find very few Hadiths narrated by <br>eminent Sahabah; those people who do riot hesitate to <br>quote Hadith (without authority) in their sermons from the <br>pulpit should take a lesson from this story. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) remained in the Prophet's com- <br>pany for most of his time; many Sahabah say: <br>L <br>Hadhrat \"Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was the most <br>learned amongst us;\" <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>137 4,<br>~r * <br>0 s  <br>\"After the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>.K8 54 <br>Q*<br>sallam), when the Khalifah's selection was under con- <br>sideration, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) * <br>addressed the people quoting all those verses of the <br>Qur'an and all such Hadiths of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) which dealt with the virtues and <br>privileges of the Ansar.\" <br>This shows how much knowledge of the Qu'ran he had, <br>and how many Hadiths he remembered. In spite of all this, <br>there are very few Ahadith that have been narrated by <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). For similar <br>reasons, Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih) too was <br>not so liberal in reporting Hadith. <br>3. \t Hadhrat Mu'sab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) Car- <br>ries out Tabligh. <br>A story about Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has already been given in Chapter VII. When the <br>first group of people from Madinah embraced Islam in <br>Mina, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) deputed <br>Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) to go with <br>them to teach Islam and preach to others. He remained <br>busy all the time in teaching the Qur'an and other Islamic <br>practices to the people. He stayed with Hadhrat As'ad bin <br>Zararah (Radhiyallaho anho) and was known as 'Muqree' <br>(the teacher). <br>Sa'd bin Ma'az and Usaid bin Hudhairiyah, who were <br>among the chiefs of Madinah, did not like Mus'ab's activi- <br>ties. Sa'd said to Usaid: <br>You go to As'ad and tell that we do not like his having <br>brought a stranger with him to Madinah, who misleads <br>the poor and simple folk of the town.\" <br>Usaid went to Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho anho) and <br>talked to him very harshly. Hadhrat As'ad (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said to him: <br>\"You first listen to him; if you like his teachings, you <br>may accept them; if not, you have every right to de- <br>nounce and stop him.\" <br>Usaid agreed to it. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) ex- <br>plained the virtues of Islam and recited a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before him. Usaid said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"These teachings are very fine and these verses are <br>simply beautiful. How do you admit a person to your <br>faith?\" <br>He said: \t \"You take a bath, put on clean clothes and recite <br>the Kalimah.\" <br>Usaid immediately complied with all these formalities and <br>embraced Islam. He then went to Sa'd and brought him to <br>Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) to listen to his Tabligh. Sa'd <br>also embraced Islam. No sooner had Sa'd accepted Islam <br>than he went to people of his clan (Banu Ash-hal) and said <br>to them: <br>\"What type of person do you think I am?\" <br>They replied: \"You are the best and the noblest of <br>clan.\" <br>the <br>He then said: \"I have vowed not to talk to your men and <br>women until you all embrace Islam and be- <br>lieve in Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe was- <br>sallam).\" <br>All the men and women of Banu Ash-ha1 embraced Islam <br>then and there. Hadhrat Mus'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) began <br>to teach them and train them in Islam. <br>No sooner did anybody embrace Islam than he began <br>to preach it. Everyone of them considered it incumbent <br>upon him to preach and teach to others what he know <br>about Islam. His trade, farm or occupation was no barrier to <br>Tabligh. <br>4. \t Hadhrat 'Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is one <br>of the most eminent Sahabah and was an expert in the reci- <br>tation of the Qur'an. Very few Arabs were literate before <br>Islam, and he was one of these. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) used to dictate the revealed Qur'an to <br>him. He memorised the Qur'an during the life time of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and had thorough <br>. <br>understanding of it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) is the <br>greatest Qari of my Ummat.\" <br><br>He used \t to finish the Qur'an once in Tahajjud in eight <br>nights. Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassalam) said <br>to him: <br>\"Allah has commanded me to recite the Qur'an to <br>you.\" <br>He said: \t \"0, Prophet of Allah! Did Allah mention me by <br>my name?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Yes, He mentioned you by your name.\" <br>Tears began to roll down his cheeks with excessive joy. <br>Hadhrat Jundub bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"When I went to Madinah to acquire knowledge, I <br>found that people were sitting in groups, and each <br>group wag entrusted to a teacher. In one of the groups I <br>saw a person teaching Hadith, clad in two sheets of <br>cloth and looking like a traveller. I asked the people, <br>'Who is this person?' They said, 'He is our esteemed <br>Imam, Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho).' <br>When he finished teaching, I followed him to his <br>house. He was staying in a very old and dilapidated <br>building, with little or no furniture. I noticed Hadhrat <br>Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) living in a very simple and <br>ascetic life.' <br>Hadhrat Ubayy (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Once the Prohet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) tested <br>me in my knowledge of the Qur'an. He asked me, <br>'Ubayy, which is the most august verse of the Qur'an?' <br>I said, 'Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) know best.' He again asked my the same question <br>and I gave the same modest and respectful reply. When <br>he put the same question once again, I replied, 'The <br>most august verse in the Qur'an is Ayatul Kursi (11: <br>255).' My reply made him very happy. He said, 'May <br>-<br>Allah bless you through your knowledge.' <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was leading <br>Salaat when he missed one verse. Ubayy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) pointed out the correction from behind. On finishing <br>Salaat, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired <br>'Who corrected me?' He was told that it was Hadhrat Ubayy <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>F <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). He remarked, 'I also thought that it <br>was he.\" <br>In spite of his devotion to knowledge and his special <br>job of writing the Qur'an, he took part in all the battles by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He did <br>not miss a single campaign or expedition led by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Huzaifah's (Radhiyallaho anho) Anxiety Re- <br>garding Tribulations. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the <br>well-known Sahabah. He is known as 'Keeper of Secrets.' <br>The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) had confided to <br>him the names of Munafiqin, and had informed him in <br>chronological order all the tribulations which the Muslims <br>were to face till the last day. He gave him full details (viz. <br>the name of the mischief maker, his parents' names, his <br>community, etc.) about the incidents that were going to <br>affect three hundred or more people. Hadhrat Huzaifah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Other people used to -ask the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about good things, while I always <br>asked him about the adverse events, so that I might <br>guard against them.\" <br>He then narrated the following conversation with the <br>Prophet: <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Shall we revert to <br>evil, after the good that you have brought <br>us?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes. The evil is coming.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"Shall we have good again after that evil?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"Huzaiiah! Go and read the Qur'an, medi- <br>tate on its meaning and follow its com-<br>mandments.\" <br>But Huzaifah anxiety grew more and more, and he con- <br>tinued his queries about evils that were to befall the ,Mus- <br>lims. <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Tell me if good will <br>come after that evil?\" <br><br>TheProphet: \t \"Yes, good will come again, but the hearts <br>of the people will not be so clear as before.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"And will there by any evil coming after <br>this good?\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Yes, There will be such persons who will <br>misguide the people and take them to Hell.\" <br>Huzaifah: \t<br>\"What should I do if I witness that time?\" <br>TheProphet: \t \"If there be a group of Muslims united <br>under one Amir, then join them, otherwise <br>dissociate yourself from all such factions <br>and be secluded in a corner, or take refuge <br>under a tree (i.e., in the forest) and be there <br>till you die.\" <br>As the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had dis- <br>closed to him the identities of the Munafiqin of that time, <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) used to ask him: <br>\"Is there any Munafiq among my deputies?\" <br>Heonce replied: \t \"Yes. There is one, but I shall not dis- <br>close his name.\" <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) dismissed the man, <br>probably by his own discernment. <br>Whenever somebody died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) would inquire if Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was participating in the funeral prayer. If <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) did not do so, then Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) would also absent himself from <br>that funeral: <br>'when Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>about to die, he wept in anxiety and uneasiness. People <br>said to him:- <br>\"Are you weeping over your departure <br>from this world?\" <br>He said: <br>\"No. I am not weeping over that. I love to <br>die. I weep because 1 do not know <br>whether, at this time of my departure <br>from this world. Allah is pleased with <br>me or not .\" <br>He then prayed: \"0,Allah, these are the last moments of <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>my life. You know that I have always <br>loved Thee. Bless my meeting with <br>Thee.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat <br>Abu <br>Hurairah's <br>(Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>Memory for Hadith. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) is another <br>eminent Sahabi. No other person has narrated as many <br>Ahadith as he has done. He embraced Islam in 7 A.H. and, <br>as the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died in 11 A.H., <br>he had been with him for four years only. People used to <br>marvel how he could remember so many Ahadith in such a <br>short period. He explains this himself, saying: <br>\"People wonder how I narrate so many Ahadith. The <br>fact is that my Muhajir brothers remained busy in trade <br>and my Ansar brothers did their farming, while I was <br>always with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I <br>was among the people of Suffah. I never cared to earn <br>my living; I was contented with the little food that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) could give me. I <br>would be with the Prop-het (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) at times when no one else was there. I once com- <br>plained to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>about my poor memory. He said, 'Spread your shawl!' I <br>did so. He made some signs on the shawl with his own <br>hands and said, 'Now wrap this shawl around you.' I <br>wrapped it around my breast. Since then, i never have <br>forgotten anything that I have wished to remember.\" <br>The people of Suftah were residents in the Prophet's <br>mosque. They had no regular source of income. They were <br>the guests of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who <br>transferred to them the Sadaqah and shared with them the <br>gifts that he received. Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was one of them. He would, sometimes, go without food for <br>days together and sometimes would behave like a lunatic, <br>due to 5p-.cessive hunger, as we have already seen in Chap- <br>ter I1I:Iri spite of such difficulties, he was all the time occu- <br>pied in memorising the sayings of the Prophet. <br>This enabled him to narrate such a large number of <br>Ahadith Imaam Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullahi alaih) has attribu- <br>ted as many as 5 374 Ahadith to him. Once he narrated the <br>following Hadith:- <br>\"A person participating in a funeral gets one Qeeraat of <br>reward if he returns after the funeral service, but gets <br>two Qeeraats of reward if he remains there till the <br>burial is over, and one Qeeraat is weightier than mount <br>Uhud.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) heard <br>this and doubted authenticity of the Hadith, saying: <br>\"0.Abu Hurairah! Think before you speak.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) got upset over <br>this and took Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) to Hadhrat 'Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), and said to <br>her: <br>\"0,Ummul-Mo'minin, I request you to say by Allah if <br>you have beard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) the Hadith regarding Qeeraats of reward?\" <br>She said: \"Yes. I have heard this Hadith.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) then said to <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"During the Prophet's time, I had no tree to plant in <br>the orchard and no merchandise to sell in the market. I <br>was always with the Prophet. My only job was to mem- <br>orise what the Prophet said, and to eat only what he <br>gave me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyal.lQho anho) said: <br>\"No doubt. Of us all, you were the most constant in at- <br>tendance to him and therefore most informed about ths <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>With all these achievements, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I recite Istighfar 12000 time daily.\" <br>He had a piece of thread with 1000 knots. He would <br>not go to sleep until he had said Subhanallah on all of <br>these knots. <br>7. \t Death of Musailamah and Compilation of QW'&. <br>Musailamah was an imposter who called himself a <br>Rrophet, even during the life time of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>laho alaihe wasallam). After the death of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), people of the weak faith, <br>especially among wandering Arabs, began to desert Islam <br>and become renegades. Musailamah took advantage of the <br>situation and succeeded in causing a large number of <br>people to fall a prey to his seduction. Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) decided to put a stop to this onslaught on Islam. <br>A fierce battle was fought with him, in which the Muslims <br>triumphed with the help of Allah, and Musailamah was <br>killed. A good number of Sahabah, including many Huffaz, <br>however, lost their lives. After this battle, Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and said: <br>\"Many Huffaz gave been slain in this battle. I am afraid <br>we are likely to lose a good portion of the Qur'an if we <br>fight a few more battles and suffer loss of Hufaaz at <br>this rate. I, therefore, suggest that the Qur'an may be <br>compiled and preserved in the form of one complete <br>book.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: <br>\"How can I venture on a thing that was not done in the <br>life of the Prophet (Sall'alkaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>But Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) pressed his point <br>so much that Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>agreed to it. He sent for Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and informed him of what had passed between <br>him and Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), and then said: <br>t <br>\"You are young and intelligent. Everybody considers <br>you trustworthy. Moreover you were charged by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with the writing <br>of the Qur'an during his life time. I, therefore, request <br>you to go to the people and collect the Qur'an from <br>them and compile it in the form of a book.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"By Allah, if Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anbo) had asked <br>me to shift a mountain from one place to another, it <br>would not have been so hard for me as the compilation <br>of the Qur'an. I said, 'How do you both dare to take up <br>a thing which was not done by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>145 & <br>k = <br>o*<br>alaihe wasallam)?\" They explained to me their point. .g 3 <br>till Allah made the truth dawn on me, and I also was s,<br>convinced of the importance of the task. I then started <br>going to the people and collecting the Qur'an from <br>those who had written it and from those who had <br>learnt it by heart, till the final collection was ready.\" <br>Look at the spirit of the Sahabah as regards their <br>strictly following the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Shifting of a mountain from its position was not so difficult <br>for them as doing a thing that they had not seen the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) doing. Allah gave <br>them the honour of doing the greatest service to Islam by <br>compiling the Qur'an, which is the source-book of Islam. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was so particular and <br>cautious that he would accept the fragments only when <br>these were proved to be written during the Prophet's time <br>and after they were duly oorroborated -by the recitation of <br>those who had preserved the Qur'an in their hearts. No <br>doubt, he had to go from door to door and person to <br>person, but Allah caused, thanks to his labours, every word <br>revealed by Him to be collected and compiled. He was con- <br>stantly assisted by Hadhrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), whom the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>declared a great expert in Qur'anic knowledge. The Mus- <br>lims of all times are highly indebted to the Sahabah for <br>their marvellous achievement. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood's (Radhiyallaho anho) Cautious- <br>ness About Hadith: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) is <br>one of those eminent Sahabah who were entrusted with the <br>task of issuing Fatwa, even during the Prophet's (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) time. He had been in the fold of Islain <br>since its advent and was one of the emigrants to Abyssinia. <br>He accompanied the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>in all his campaigns and worked as his attendant. He car- <br>ried the shoes of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>provided him with a pillow when he needed one, and <br>brought him water for his Wudhu. He was therefore cailed <br>\"The Keeper of the shoes\", \"The Keeper of Pillow\" and <br>\"The Manager for Wudhu\". The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) once said: <br>\"Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) is the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>only person whom I can safely appoint as an Amir <br>without consulting anybody.\" <br>He was permitted by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to visit him at all times. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>(1) \"If you want to recite the Qur'an as it was revealed <br>to me, then copy the recitation of Abdullah bin <br>Mas'ood.\" <br>(2) \t \"Believe in what Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>iaho anho) narrates about me.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Moosa Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) and his <br>mother visited the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) house so often and were so at home there that the <br>people of Yemen, who had come to see the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), took him as one of the <br>Ahlul Bait (family member.)\" Though he was so near <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), yet he was <br>very cautious about narrating the words of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu 'Amir Shai- <br>bani (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I stayed with Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) for one year. I never heard him attributing any <br>words direct to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Whenever he intended doing so, he would shiver <br>with fear.\" <br>Hadhrat 'Amr bin Idairnoon (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I have been visiting Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) every Thursday for one year: I never heard <br>him attributing any words direct to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). Once he was narrrating Hadith. <br>When he uttered the words 'The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said so,' then his body began to <br>shiver, his eyes became full of tears, his forehead <br>sweated, his veins swelled and he said 'Insha-Allah' <br>the Prophet said so, or something like that, it might be <br>something less or something more.\" <br>Look at the Sahabah's caution and care about Hadith. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe waaallam) said: <br><br>\"A person who attributes anything to me, which I have <br>not said, is making his abode in the Hell.\" <br>This is why the Sahabah, though speaking and doing every- <br>thing according to the instructions and example of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), were afraid of attribu- <br>ting any words to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>lest they should be different from what the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) had actually uttered. On the other <br>hand, we go on quoting Ahadith without being sure of their <br>authenticity and fear not the serious consequences of at- <br>tributing wrongly anything to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). It may be mentioned that the Fiqah.Hani- <br>fiyah is based mostly on the Ahadith narrated by Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>9. \t<br>A Person Travels from Madinah to Damascus For One <br>Hadith. <br>Kathir bin Qais narrates: <br>\"I was sitting with Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in a musjid in Damascus, when a person came to <br>him and said, '0,Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), I have come all the way from Madinah to learn <br>one Hadith from you, as I understand you have heard <br>it directly from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Have you any other business in Damascus?\" <br>The person: <br>\"No.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Are you sure that you have no other work in Damas-<br>cus?\" <br>The person: <br>\"I have come to this place with the sole purpose of <br>learning this Hadith,\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Listen. I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho aliahe <br>wasallam) saying, 'Allah eases the way to Paradise for <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>one who traverses some distance to seek knowledge. <br>The angels spread their wings under his feet, and all <br>things in heavens and earth (even the fish in the water) <br>pray for his forgiveness. The superiority of a person <br>possessing knowledge over a person doing worship is <br>as the superiority of the moon over the stars. The <br>Ulama are the inheritors of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wassallam). The legacy of Prophets (Alaihimus- <br>salaam) is neither gold nor silver. Their legacy is <br>knowledge. A person who acquires knowledge ac-<br>quires a great wealth.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu-Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) is foremost <br>among the Sahabah who possessed very sound knowledge <br>in religion. He is called 'Hakim-ul-Ummah' (The Sage of <br>Islam). He once said: <br>\"Before Islam, I lived on trade. After accepting Islam, I <br>tried to combine the service of Allah with my business, <br>but I could not do so. I therefore gave up business and <br>devoted myself solely to the service of Allah. Now if I <br>have a shop at the gate of a musjid and have no fear of <br>losing a single Salaat thereby, and even if the shop <br>gives me a daily profit of 40 dinars to spend the whole <br>lot in the path of Allah, even then I am not willing to <br>turn to business.\" <br>Somebody inquired the reason. He replied:- <br>\"Because of the fear of reckoning.\" <br>He used to say: <br>\"I love death, so that I may meet Allah. I <br>love destitutioq, so that I be meek. I love sickness, so <br>that I be pardoned my sins.\" <br>In this story, we find a person travelling all the way <br>from Madinah to Damascus for the sake of one Hadith. This <br>was not at all hard for those people. Hadhrat Sha'abi (Kah- <br>matullahi alaih) is a famous Muhaddith of Koofa. He once <br>narrated a Hadith to one of his students and said: <br>\"You are listening to this Hadith while sitting in your <br>home town. People had to travel all their way to Madi- <br>nah for even less important things, because Madinah <br>was the only of seat learning in those days.\" <br>, Saeed ibnul Musayyab (Rahmatullahi alaihf is a famous <br>Tabi'ee. He says: <br><br>\"For each Hadith that I have learnt, I had to travel on <br>foot for days and nights together.\" <br>Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullahi alaih) was born in Shawwal <br>194 A.H. He started learning Hadith in 205 A.H. i.e., when <br>he was only eleven. He had memorised all the books writ- <br>ten by Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullahi alaih) while <br>he was in his early teens. After collecting Ahadith from all <br>the learned men of his own locality, he set out in 216 A.H. <br>in search of further knowledge. His father died and he <br>could not leave his widowed mother alone. He therefore <br>took her with him on his long and strenuous journey to <br>Balkh, Baghdad, Mecca, Basra, Koofah, Asqalan, Hims and <br>Damascus. He collected all the available Ahadith from <br>these seats of learning. He was accepted as an expert in <br>Hadith, while he had not a single hair on his chin. He <br>writes: <br>I was eighteen when I compiled the Fatwah of the Sa- <br>habah and Tabi'ees.\" <br>Hashad (Rahmatullahi alaihe) and one of his companions <br>say:-<br>\"Bukhari and we two used to go together to the same <br>teacher. We noted down all the Ahadith that we learnt, <br>but he wrote nothing. After many days we said to him, <br>'Bukhari, you are wasting your time.' He kept quiet. <br>When we admonished him again and again, he said, <br>'You are now annoying me too much. Bring your <br>notes.' We brought our notes, which covered about <br>15,000Ahadith. He, to our utter amazement, recited all <br>those Ahadith by heart.\" <br>10. \t Hadhrat Ibn Abbas's (Radhiyallaho anho) Thirst For <br>Knowledge. <br>Hadhrat AbdulIah bin Abbas (~adhiyallaho <br>anho) says: <br>\"After the passing away of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), I said to an Ansari friend of mine. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is not now <br>with us. But a large number of Sahabah are still among <br>us. Let us go to them and get knowledge of the Islamic <br>practices\". He said. 'Who is going to approach you for <br>learning a regulation in the presence of these eminent <br>Sahabah?' I was not discouraged. I kept up my quest <br>for knowledge and approached every person who was <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>supposed to have heard something from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). I managed to gather sub- <br>stantial information from the Ansar. If on my visit to <br>someone of the Sahabah, Ifound him asleep, I spread <br>my shawl at the gate and sat waiting. Sometimes my <br>face and body would get covered with dust, but I kept <br>sitting till they woke and I was able to contact them. <br>Some of them said: 'Abdullah you are the cousin of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); you could have <br>sent for us. Why did you take the trouble of coming to <br>our places?' I said to them: 'I must come to you, for I <br>am a student and you are my teachers.' Some people <br>for whom I had waited said: 'Since when have you <br>been waiting for us?' I informed them that I had been <br>sitting there for a pretty long time. They said: 'What a <br>pity! You could have awakened us from our sleep.' I <br>said:\"I did not like to disturb you for my own sake.' I <br>thus carried on my pursuits, till there came a time <br>when people began to flock to me for learning. My <br>Ansari friend realised this at that time and remarked. <br>'This boy has surely proved himself more sensible than <br>us.\" <br>It was \\this devotion to knowledge, which caused <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) to be <br>known as ~ i b r - u l - ~ m m a t  <br>(the most learned man of Islam) <br>and Bahrul Ulum (ocean of knowledge) in his time. At the <br>time of his death, he was in Taif. Hadhrat Muhammad bin <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) led the funeral service and said: <br>\"Today we have lost our godly leader.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bih Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah~bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is noted for <br>his knowledge of the occasions when various verses of <br>the Qur'an were revealed.\" <br>According to Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) Hadhrat <br>Ibne Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the most eminent <br>Ulama of Islam. This is all due to his hard labour in acquir-<br>ing knowledge. Had he considered himself a member of the <br>Prophet's family (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and as such <br>4 \tdemanded respect from the people instead of going to them <br>for knowledge, he could not have attained this position. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br><br>~ h .  \t<br>VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>\"Be most humble and respectful to persons from <br>whom you receive knowledge.\" <br>Mujahid says: \"A proud or shy student cannot gain much.\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I am a slave to the person who has taught me even a <br>single word. He may sell me or set me free.\" <br>Hadhrat Yahya bin Kathir (Rahmalullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Knowledge and easy living cannot go hand in hand.\" <br>Hadhrat Imam Shaf'i (Rahmatullah aiaih) says: <br>\"A student who learns half-heartedly and ungratefully <br>can never succeed. A student who is humble and hard- <br>living often reaches his goal.\" <br>Mughirah says: \t \"We feared our teachor Hadhrat Ibrahim <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) more than even the <br>kings of our times.\" <br>Hadhrat Bukhari (Rahmatullah alaih) writes about Yahya <br>bin Ma'een, the famous Mohaddith: <br>\"I have never seen a person more respectful to the Muhad- <br>dithin than Yahya.\" <br>Imam Abu Yusuf (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I \t have heard from eminent people that a student who <br>does not respect his teacher is never successful.\" <br>This story shows that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) was very humble and respectful to <br>those from whom he learnt Islam. It also shows his devo- <br>tion to knowledge. He did not mind any amount of labour <br>or inconvenience in going to persons who had some knowl- <br>edge of Hadith. In fact, nothing can be achieved without in- <br>convenience. As the Arabic proverb goes <br>\"A person who wishes to excel1 others must burn the <br>midnight oil.\" <br>It is said about Hadhrat Harith bin Yazid, Hadhrat Ibn Shu- <br>brumah, Hadhrat Qa'qaa, and Hadhrat Mughirah (Rahma- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>tullahi alaihim) that they held discussions over religious <br>matters among themselves after Isha and would not dis- <br>perse before Azaan of Fajr. Hadhrat Laith bin Sa'eed (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Zilhri (Rahmatullah alaih) sat after Isha with <br>Wudhu and continued his discussion on Hadith till it <br>was Fajr.\" <br>Darawardi says: <br>\"I saw Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik in the <br>Prophet's musjid after Isha, discussing some religious <br>point very calmly and without offending each other. <br>They dispersed only after performing Fajr Salaat.\" <br>Ibn Furat Baghdadi (Rahmatullah a1aih)-a <br>Milhaddith, <br>left on his death, eighteen boxes full of books. Most of <br>these books were written in his own hand. He is famous <br>among Muhaddithin for his authentic and systematic <br>record. <br>Ibn Jauzi (Rahmatullah alaih) is another famous Mu- <br>haddith. He was brought up as an orphan, as he lost his <br>father when he was only three. He was so studious that he <br>would not leave his house except for Jum'uah prayer. He <br>once declared from the pulpit, pointing to his fingers: <br>\"With these fingers I have written or copied no less <br>than two thousand books.\" <br>He was himself the author of more than two hundred and <br>fifty books. It is said that he never remained idle. He used <br>to write four parts of a book daily. His lessorls were so pop- <br>ular that as many as 400000 students at a time listened to <br>him. The kings, their ministers and chiefs would also <br>attend his lectures. He himself says: <br>\"As many as 100000 disciples have pledged devotion <br>to me, and not less than 20000 disbelievers have ac- <br>cepted Islam at my hands.\" <br>He also had to suffer much at the hands of Shiahs, who <br>were in power those days. While mending his reed pen, he <br>preserved the chips, and at the time of his death expressed <br>I<br>the desire that those chips be used for warming the water <br>for washing his dead body. It is said that not only the pre- <br>served stock was sufficient for warming water, but a part <br>was still left unused. <br><br>Ch. VIII: Zeal for Knowledge <br>153 8 ,<br>\"0s <br>Yahya bin Ma'een (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous shaikh -84 <br>of Ahadith. He says: <br>wSW <br>\"I have written one million Ahadith with my own <br>hand\". <br>Ibn Jarir Tabari (Rahmatullah alaih) is a historian of great <br>fame. He is an authority on the history of the Sahabah and <br>Tabien. For forty years, he wrote 80 pages daily. After his <br>death, his output in written work (since his maturity) was <br>calculated to come to 28 pages daily. The book on history <br>written by him which is generally available is very famous <br>and popular. When he planned to write this book, he said <br>to the people round him: <br>\"You will be pleased to learn that <br>intend writing a book on world history. <br>They inquired- <br>\"How big will that book be?\" <br>He said: <br>\"About 30 000 leaves.\" <br>They remarked: \"Who will live to finish this book?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raaji-oon. <br>People have become so unaspiring.\" <br>He then decided to condense the material, which still cov- <br>ered 6 000 pages. The same story is reported about his book <br>on the meaning and commentary of the Qu'ran. This is also <br>a very famous and popular book. <br>Daaraqutni (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous writer on <br>Hadith. He travelled to Baghdad, Basrah, Koofah, Wasit, <br>Egypt and Syria for learning Hadith. Once he was attending <br>the class of his teacher. During the teacher's lecture he was <br>once seen copying from a certain book. One of the fellow <br>students admonished him saying: <br>\"How can you listen to the Shaikh while doing that <br>work?\" <br>IIe said: \"There is a difference in my listening and yours. <br>Tell me how many Hadiths has the Shaikh recited so <br>far?\" <br>The student began to think. Daaraqutni (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>said: <br>\"Now let me tell you. The Shaikh has so far recited <br>eighteen Hadiths and these are . . .\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He then repeated all the eighteen Ahadiths that the Shaikh <br>had recited in the same order, quoting the chain of narra- <br>tion in each case. <br>Hafiz Athram (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith. He <br>had a wonderful capacity for memorising Ahadith. Once he <br>was in Mecca for Hajj. Two reputed Shaikhs from Khurasan <br>were holding their lectures on Hadith in the Haram separa- <br>tely, and a large number of people were listening to each <br>Shaikh. He sat between the two groups and noted down the <br>lectures of both the Shaikhs at one and the same time. <br>Abdullah bin Mubarak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Mo- <br>haddith of great fame. His labours and efforts in collecting <br>Hadiths are known to everybody. He says: <br>\"I have learnt Hadith from four thousand teachers.\" <br>Ali bin Hasan (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>':It was a very cold night when I and Ibn Mubarak step- <br>ped out from the musjid after lsha. We continued dis- <br>cussion on a Hadith while standing there, till we heard <br>the Azaan for Fajr.\" <br>Humaidi (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith, who has <br>combined Bukhari and Muslim in one compilation. It is <br>said that he wrote throughout the night. When it was very <br>hot, he would write while sitting in a tub of water. He also <br>wrote poetry. The following verses have been written by <br>him:-<br>Mixing with people does not benefit <br>Beyond waste of time in gossip; <br>Don't go to the people, except <br>For acquiring knowledge and piety <br>Imam Tabrani (Rahmatullah alaih) is a reputed Muhad- <br>L<br>dith and author of numerous books. Somebody inquired: <br>, <br>\"How could you write so many books, Shaikh?\" <br>He replied: \"I have been on my mat for thirty years.\" <br><br>-<br>4.r <br>0 %<br>E a<br>Abul Abbas Shirazi (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>-cC, <br>srij<br>\"I have learnt 300000 Ahadith from Tabrani.\" <br>m <br>Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah alaih) laboured very <br>hard in going deep into those Ahadiths which contradicted <br>some others. Koofah was the centre of Islamic learning in <br>those days. He had collected Hadith from all the Muhaddi- <br>thin of that place. Whenever a Muhaddith from outside <br>came to Koofah, he sent his students to him to ascertain if <br>he knew any such Hadith that was not known to him. The <br>Imam had established a circle where scholars of Hadith, <br>Fiqah, and Philology gathered together. They had dis-<br>cussions on regulations about Islamic practices. Sometimes <br>the discussions continued for one month before a point <br>was agreed upon, and written in the book of regulations for <br>the people of his school of thought. <br>Imam Tirmizi (Rahmatullah alaih) is known to one and <br>all. He was unique in his capacity for memorising and re- <br>taining Ahadith. His memory was marvellous. Some Mu- <br>haddithin once tested his memory. They recited before him <br>forty-one Hadiths. Imam Tirmizi (Kadmatullah alaih) im- <br>mediately repeated all of them. He himself writes: <br>\"On my way to Mecca, I copied two parts from the col- <br>lections of Hadith by a Shaikh. I happened to come <br>across that Shaikh personally. I said to him, 'I have <br>copied two parts of your collections. I wish to compare <br>those Hadiths by listening to them directly from you.' <br>The Shaikh agreed. While going to his place I, by rnis.% <br>take, took a blank book instead of the note book in <br>which I had copied the Hadiths. The Shaikh started re- <br>citing the Hadiths, while I held the blank book in my <br>hand. When he noticed it, he was very angry with me. <br>I explained to him how that had happened, and said, <br>'Shaikh, your time is not wasted. I remember every- <br>thing that you have said.' He did not believe me and <br>asked me to repeat all that he had recited. I repeated <br>all the Ahadith. He thought I had memorised them <br>before I came to him. I said, 'You may recite some <br>other Hadiths.' He recited forty new Hadiths. I re-<br>peated all of them without any error.\" <br>It is very difficult to work and labour as hard as these <br>Muhaddithin did in collecting, memorising and propagat- <br>ing Hadith. It is difficult even to cover all such stories. Qar- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>ramah (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith who is not very <br>famous. One of his students, Daud, says: <br>\"People speak about the memory of Abu Hatim (Rah- <br>matullah alaih). I have never seen a person with better <br>memory than Qartamah. Once he said to me, \"Pick any <br>of the books from my library. I shall recite it from my <br>memory.\" I picked up 'Kitabul-Ashribah.' He recited <br>the whole book in the reverse order i.e.. reading from <br>the end to the beginning of each chapter.\" <br>Abu Zur'ah (Rahmatullahi alaih) says: <br>\"Imam Ahmad bin Hambal (Rahmatullah alaih) re-<br>membered one million Ahadith by heart. I have col- <br>lected 100 000 Ahadith and I know 30 000 of them by <br>heart.\" <br>Khafaf (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"Ishaq (Rahmatulla alaih) once dictated to us 11000 <br>Ahadith from his memory. He then repeated all of <br>them in the same order, with no error at all.\" <br>Abu Sa'd Isbahani, (Rahmatullah alaih) when he was <br>only sixteen, left from Baghdad to learn Hadith from Abu <br>Nasr (Rahmatullah alaih). He heard about his death on the <br>way. He cried bitterly like a child, and would say: <br>\"How shall I know the chain of narrators of his Ha- <br>diths?\" <br>Such crying is not possible without love and devotion. He <br>knew the 'Muslim' collection of Ahadith by heart and <br>taught the book to histpuplis from memory. <br>Abu Umar Dharir (Rahmatullah alaih) was blind by <br>birth, but is counted among the Huffaaz of Hadith. He was <br>an expert in History, Fiqah, L,aw of inheritance and math- <br>ematics. <br>Abul Husain Isfahani (Rahmatullah alaih) remembered <br>the Bukhari and Muslim compilations both by heart. Buk- <br>hari was so deeply fixed in his memory that he would give <br>the chain of narrators for any text or vice versa. <br>Shaikh Taqi-ud-Din Ba'albakki (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>memorised the 'Muslim' in four months. He was also Hafiz <br>of Hadith common in Muslim's and Bukhari's compila- <br>tions. He was a saint, and many miracles are attributed to <br><br>him. He had also memorised the Qur'an. It is said that <br>Soorah Al-An'aam was memorised by him in one day. <br>Ibnus-Sunni (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous pupil of <br>Imam Nasai (Kahmatullah alaih). He was writing Hadith <br>even upto the last moments of his life. His son says: <br>\"My father was writing Hadith when he put aside the <br>pen, raised his hands in prayer and breathed his last.\" <br>Allamah Saaji (Kahmatullah alaih) mastered Fiqah in <br>his teens. Then he began to acquire knowledge about <br>Iiadith. Ile stayed in Herat for ten years and wrote the <br>whole of 'Tirmizi' six times during that stay. His teacher <br>Ibn Mandah (Rahmatullah alaih) died while teaching him <br>'Gharaib Sho'bah' after Isha. <br>Abu-Umar Khafaf (Rahmatullah alaih) remembered <br>100 000 hadiths by heart. More than 100 000 persons at- <br>tended the lectures of Asim bin Ali (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>(Shaikh of Imam Bukhari) when he was in Baghdad. One <br>day, an audience of 120 000 was estimated during his lec- <br>ture. The words uttered by hinl were relayed a number of <br>times, before these could be heard by all the people. The <br>words \"Al-Laith (Rahmatullah alaih) reported to me,\" ut- <br>tered by him, once had to be relayed fourteen times. <br>Abu Muslim Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) on reaching <br>Baghdad took his class to a big ground. Seven hucdred <br>men were relaying his lecture. 40 000 ink-pots, used for <br>taking down his lecture, were counted in one lecture. <br>There were many more who simply listened. In the lectures <br>by Faryabi (Rdhmatullah alaih) there used to be 316 per- <br>sons who would relay his words to enable people to write <br>these down. It was this labour and devotion which has <br>caused the sacred knowledge to live upto our time. <br>Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I cornpiled my collection of 7 275 Ahadith by selec- <br>tion from 600 000. I have been saying Salaat of 2 ra-<br>kaats before writing each Hadith\".' <br>When Imaam Bukhari (Kahmatullah alaih) came to Bagh- <br>dad, the Muhaddithin tested his knowledge. Ten persons <br>were nominated for the test. Each of these persons selected <br>ten Ahadith of his choice and, after making some changes <br><br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>in the wording, recited each Hadith before Imam Bukhari <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). On each recital, he would say: <br>\"1 do not know such Hadith.\" <br>When all had finished, he addressed each man saying: <br>\"Brother, the first Hadith you recited as such (reciting <br>as the man had done), but actually it is such (reciting <br>the correct wording) . . .and so on.\" <br>He repeated all the hundred Ahadith first in the form in <br>which those men had recited, and again in the correct form <br>in that very order. <br>Imam Muslim (Rahmatullah alaih) started learning <br>Hadith when he was fourteen, and remained engaged in <br>that till his death. He says: <br>\"I have compiled my book of <br>from 300 000 Ahadith.\" <br>12 000 after selecting <br>Abu Daud (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I had collected 500 000 Ahadith, but I selected only <br>4 800 for inclusion in my book.\" <br>Yusuf Muzi (Rahmatullah alaih) is a famous Muhadith. <br>He is an Imam in the science of Asmaa-ur Rijaal (classifica- <br>tion of reporting persons). After learning Fiqh and Hadith <br>from the teachers in his own town he went to Mecca, Madi- <br>nah, Halb, Hamat Ba'albak etc, in search of further knowl- <br>edge. He is the writer of many books. 'Tahzib-ul-Kamal' is <br>in 200 parts and 'Kitab-ul-Atraaf' has more than 80 parts. <br>He often kept quiet and spoke very little. Most of the time, <br>he was engaged intreading or writing. He suffered at the <br>hands of his enemies, who were jealous of him, but he <br>never retaliated. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the stories of other <br>illustrious people about their service to knowledge. The de- <br>tails of their toils cannot be covered even in several vol- <br>umes. What has been written above is only meant to give a <br>few glimpses of the pains that our elders in Islam have <br>taken in the development of knowledge about Hadith and <br>leaving it to us in such an accomplished form. Let those <br>people who profess to seek knowledge see for themselves <br>what sacrifices they are really making in this field: It is <br>futile to hope that the knowledge about the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), which has thus reached us, will be <br><br> <br>spread and brought into practice while we remain absorbed <br>in our luxuries, comforts, pleasures and other worldly en- <br>gagements. <br>.g %P <br>cn~<br>r<br>n<br> <br><br>CHAPTER IX <br>PLEASING THE PROPHET <br>(SALLALLAHO ALAIHE WASALLAM) <br>As we have already seen from the stories in previous <br>chapters, obedience to Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was the guiding factor in the Sahabah's <br>life. Stories given exclusively in this chapter are to enable <br>us to examine our way of living and see how far we are pre- <br>pared to please Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alihe wa- <br>sallam), in order to deserve the necessary progress and <br>other blessings, which the Sahabah received. If we are desi- <br>rous of similar results, we shall have to live the way they <br>lived. <br>1. \t Hadhrat Ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) Burns His <br>Sheet. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr ibnul Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"Once we were accompanying the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on a journey. I went to see him and I <br>was wearing a saffron coloured sheet. He said to me, <br>'What is this that you are wearing?' I felt that he did <br>not like my wearing a dress of that colour. When I <br>reached home, ,Ifound a fire burning in the hearth. I <br>threw my garment into the fire. The next day when I <br>went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he <br>inquired, 'Where is that sheet?' I told him what I had <br>done with it. He remarked, \"You could have given it to <br>one of the ladies in your house, women are permitted <br>to wear clothes of that colour.\" <br>In fact, Abdullah was so much perturbed at the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) displeasure that he <br>did not hesitate to avail of the first opportunity of doing <br>away with the sheet that caused the displeasure. He did not <br>even think of making any other use of that garment. If we <br>had been in his place, we would have thought of some <br>excuse or the other for keeping it, or at least finding some <br>other use for it. <br><br>Ch. IX: Pleasing the Prophet <br>2. \t<br>An Ansari razes a building to the ground. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once 8 <br>passing through a street of Madinah when he saw a build- <br>ine with a dome. He inauired of the comoanions, \"What is <br>thrs?\" They informed him that it was a n'ew building built <br>by one of the Ansar. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) ramained silent. At some other time, the Ansari who <br>had built that house came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and greeted him with 'Assalamo alaikum'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) turned his face from <br>him. He repeated the greetings, but the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) again gave him the cold shoulder. He was <br>very much shocked to notice the Prophet's aversion for <br>him. When he investigated, he was given the account of the <br>Prophet's inquring about his new building. He immediately <br>went and razed the new building to the ground, and'did <br>not even inform the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>about his action. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>happened to pass that way again. He inquired: <br>\"Where is that building with a dome that I saw at this <br>spot last time?\" <br>The Sahabah informed him of Ansari's razing it to the <br>ground, as it had been the likelv cause of the Prophet's dis- <br>pleasure. He remarked. <br>\"Every new structure is a sinful burden for its owner, <br>except that which is absolutely essdntial.\" <br>This is a matter of love and devotion. The Sahabah <br>could not bear the displeasure of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and, no sooner did they smell such a <br>thing, than they removed the cause thereof at all costs. <br>Again the person does not even inform the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) of his drastic action in removing the <br>cause of his displeasure, till he himself happened to notice <br>it. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had a special <br>aversion for the people wasting their monev on buildings. <br>His own house was a temporary structure of date palm, <br>with mats serving the purpose of walls to secure privacy. <br>Once, during his absence from Madinah, Ummul Mp'minin <br>Umme Salma (Radhiallaho anha) who had some money in <br>hand, erected walls of unbaked bricks for her house. When <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) returned from his <br>journey, he asked her: <br>\"Why did you do this?\" <br>She replied: \"0,Prophet of Allah. This is only to have <br>better privacy.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The worst use of money is to spend it in raising up <br>buildings.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>\"I and my mother were once repairing a wall of our <br>house. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) hap- <br>pened to see us working and remarked: 'Your own fall <br>(death) is more at hand than the fall of this wall.\" <br>3. \t<br>Sahabah's Discard of Red Sheets of Saddle Cloth. <br>Hadhrat Rafe' (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We were once with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) on a journey. The sheets that we had spread on <br>our camels were decorated with red thread work on <br>the borders. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, 'I notice that the red colour has begun to catch <br>your fancy.' We stood up and dispersed in confusion at <br>this rebuke; so much so that our camels seeing our b,e- <br>wilderment began to run about. We immediately re- <br>moved the sheetsfrom their backs.\" <br>We are surprised on hearing such stories about Saha- <br>bah, as we are living in a different atmosphere with quite a <br>different frame of mind. When the Truce of Hudeybiyah <br>was being negotiated, Urwah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) an envoy of Qureysh, had an opportunity of studying <br>very carefully the behaviour of Sahabah. When he returned <br>to his people, he said to them: <br>\"I have been to the courts of great kings and monarchs <br>as an envoy. I have met the Emperors of Persia, Rome <br>and Abyssinia. Nowhere have I seen people around a <br>sovereign so respectful to him as I saw the companions <br>of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). When he <br>spits, his sputum is not allowed to fall on the ground. <br><br>It is taken by somebody in his hands to anoint his face <br>and body therewith. When he issues some order, e1 ery <br>person hastens to carry it out. When he makes Wu ihu, <br>his companions race one with another to snatch the <br>water trickling down from his limbs, in such a way <br>that an observer would think they are going to fight <br>over that water. When he speaks, everybody is silent as <br>if they were dumb. Nobody raises his eyes to look at <br>him, out of respect for him.\" <br>4. \t Hadhrat Waa'il (Radhiyallaho anho) Has His Hair <br>Cut. <br>Hadhrat Waa'il bin Hajar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once visited the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) when the hair on my head was long. While I was <br>sitting with him, he uttered the words. 'Zubab, Zubab' <br>(Meaning something evil or ominous). I though he was <br>referring to my hair. I returned home and had my hair <br>cut. Next day when I again went to him, he said, 'I <br>never referred to your hair when I uttered those words <br>yesterday. Any how, it is good that you had your hair <br>cut.\" <br>This shows the frame of mind of those people. They <br>tolerated no delay in acting upon the wishes of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), whether they understood it <br>rightly or wrongly. They never thought it necessary to fur- <br>ther inquire or clarify. <br>In the early years, talking in Salaat was permissible. <br>Once Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallake-anho) <br>visited the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while he <br>was saying his Salaat. He greated him with \"Assallamo'a- <br>laikum\" but received no reply, as to talk in Salaat had <br>meanwhile been forbidden. He says: <br>\"For receiving no reply, all sorts of explanations began <br>to haunt my mind. I thoLdht perhaps he is displeased <br>with me, or he is angry with me on such and such ac- <br>count, and so on.' At last when the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) finished his Salaat and informed me <br>that Allah had forbidden talking in Salaat I heaved a <br>sigh of relief.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>5. \t<br>Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up <br>what is not liked bythe Prophet: <br>Hadhrat Suhdil bin Hanzalah CRadhiyallaho anho) was <br>living a life of seclusion in Damascus. He did not mix with <br>people, nor did he go anywhere. He was either busy in <br>Salaat or in Zikr throughout the day. While going to <br>musjid, he would pass by Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), one of the eminent Sahabah. Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) would say to him: <br>\"0,Suhail! Let us hear some good words from you. We <br>shalI'gain much, though you will lose nothing.\" <br>Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) would then relate <br>something that he had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), or some event that he had seen in his life <br>time. Once on Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>request as usual, he said: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) made a <br>mention of Hadhrat Khuraim Asadi (Radhiyallaho<br>anho) and said, \"He is a good man except for two <br>habits, viz, he keeps the hair of his head too long and <br>he allows his izaar to go below his ankles. When Khu- <br>raim leal'nt this, he immediately cut the hair up to his <br>ears and began to keep his izaar up to the middle of the <br>calf of his leg.\" <br>6. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) gives up <br>speaking with his son. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once <br>said: <br>\"I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying. 'Allow your women to go to the musjid.\" <br>One of his sons remarked: <br>\"We cannot allow our women to go to the musjid, as <br>this may lead to corruption later on.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn-Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) became very angry <br>and rebuked his son, saying: <br>\"When I tell you that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has allowed our women folk to go to musjid, <br>how dare you say that you cannot allow them.\" <br><br>He then, refused to speak to him throughout his.life. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho's) son obviously <br>had no intention of disobeying the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He feared corruption in allowing the <br>women-folk of that time to go to the musjid. For the same <br>reason, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) is reported to <br>have said: <br>\"If the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had seen <br>the women of our time, he would have stopped them <br>from going to the musjid.\" <br>Now, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said this not <br>very long after the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho hlaihe <br>wasallam). Notwithstanding all this, Hadhrat Ibn Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his son refusing to <br>do something which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had desired to be done, and he gave up talking to him <br>for the rest of his life. The Sahabah sometimes found them- <br>selves faced with a dilemma regarding the women visiting <br>the musjid. On the one hand, there was the explicit desire <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in favour of <br>permitting them to go to the musjid, and on the other there <br>was the possibility of looseness in society (the signs of <br>which were becoming visible) that demanded an immedi- <br>ate check on this permission. Hadhrat 'Atikah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) the wife of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>went to musjid regularly but Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) did <br>not like it. Somebody told her that Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) did not like her going to the musjid. She <br>said: <br>\"Why does he not prevent me from doing it then?\" <br>After the death of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Hadhrat 'Atikah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Hadh- <br>rat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho). He also did not like her <br>going to musjid, but could not check her for the above ob- <br>vious reason. Once he sat in her way to musjid and, as she <br>passed by him, he teased her. In the dark, she could not <br>make out who it was. After this incident, she stopped going <br>to musjid. When Zubair inquired of her: <br>\"Why do not you go to the musjid now?\" <br>She replied: \"Times have changed.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) Replies to a <br>Question. <br>Somebody said to Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"Allah has said in the Qur'arl something about Salaat <br>in peace and Salaat in fear. but He has not said any- <br>thing about Salaat during a journey.\" <br>He replied: \"0,my nephew! Allah sent Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) as his Apostle to us, when we <br>were ignorant and knew nothing. We must do what we <br>have seen him doing.\" <br>This shows that it is not necessary that each and every <br>regulation should be explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. <br>The acts of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is a <br>very good guide for our practice. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"I have been given the Qur'an and also other com- <br>mandments. Beware of the time, which is coming <br>shortly, when carefree people sitting on their couches <br>will say. 'Stick to the Qur'an only. Carry out only the <br>commandments contained therein.' \" <br>Such corrup!ted views are generally inspired by arrogance <br>due to wealth, and perhaps that is why the word \"carefree\" <br>is used for such people. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Mughaffal (Radhiyallaho anho) Discon- <br>tinues Relations With His Nephew. <br>A young nephe& of Hadhrat Abdullah-bin-Mughaffal <br>(Radhiyallaho allaho anho) was playing 'Khazaf'. He said to <br>him: <br>\"0nephew! Stop doing that. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has prohibited this play. It can <br>neither shoot a bird nor harm an enemy it is likely to <br>injure somebody's eye or tooth. <br>The boy stopped playing but, after some time when he <br>thought that his uncle was not watching him, he started <br>doing it again Hadhrat Ibne-Mughaffal (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was very angry and said: <br>\"How dare you do a thing after knowing that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbidden it? <br><br>By Allah! I will never speak to you again. 1 will never <br>visit you when you are sick, nor join your funeral if <br>you die during my life time.\" <br>'Khazaf' is a game in which a pebble is placed on the <br>thumb and then thrown with the force of other fingers. <br>Children are fond of playing such games. Hadhrat Ibn Mug- <br>haffal [Radhiyallaho anho) could not tolerate his nephew's <br>ignoring the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Do we not know the instructions of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) about many things we are wont to <br>do from morning till evening? How much regard do we <br>have in our hearts for his verdict? Let everybody ponder <br>over it himself and answer. <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Ibn Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) Gives up <br>Begging. . <br>Hadhrat Hakim bin Hizam (Radhiyallaho anho) came <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and begged him <br>for help. He gave him something. Next time he came and <br>asked for something. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) gave him something this time also. When he came to <br>beg the third time, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam), after giving him something, said: <br>\"Hakim! Money has a deceptive appearance. It appears <br>to be very sweet (but it is really not so). It is a blessing <br>when earned with contentment of heart, but there is no <br>satisfaction in it when it is got with greed.\" <br>Hakim said: \t \"0,Prophet of Allah, I will not bother any- <br>body after this.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in the time of <br>his Khilafat offered to help Hakim from Baitul Mal, but he <br>refused. Again Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) as Amir-ul-Mo- <br>minin requested Hakim many times to accept something <br>from him, but he did not agree. <br>Our greed and avarice know no bounds; this is why we <br>find no blessings in what we earn. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) Goes For <br>Spying. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) narattes: <br>\"In the war of the Trench, we were facing a very big <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>army of the enemy, comprising of non-believers from <br>Mecca and other such groups. At the same time, the <br>Jews of Banu Quraizah in Madinah were preparing to <br>stab us in the back, and we apprehended their plun- <br>dering our houses and families, for all of us were out- <br>side defending Madinah against the invaders. The <br>Munafiqin started asking permission from the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to go back to Madinah, on <br>the pretext of their homes being unattended and open <br>to the enemy. He permitted every one of them. During <br>those days of trial, one night it was unusually very <br>dark and windy, It was so dark that one could not see <br>one's own hand, and the wind was blowing wildly. <br>The Munafiqin were returning to their homes. We, <br>three hundred strong, were sticking to our posts. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) approached every <br>one and made enquiries about him. I had no arms to <br>defend myself, nor clothes to resist the cold. I had only <br>one small sheet, which belonged to my wife and was <br>lent to me. I wrapped it round my loins and sat with <br>my knees clinging to the ground. When the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) passed by me, he said, <br>'Who are you? I said, 'Huzaifah!' I could not stand up <br>due to severe cold and I clung to the ground more <br>tightly with shame. He said, 'Huzaifah, stand up and <br>go to the enemy camp and bring us their news.' Of all <br>the Sahabah, I was the most ill-equipped, both against <br>the enemy and against the cold that night, but as soon <br>as I got the order I stood up and left for the enemy <br>camp. As I was going, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prayedffor me saying, '0 Allah! Protect him <br>from all directions.' Immediately after his prayer, I was <br>completely relieved of my fear and cold. I felt as if I <br>were walking in a warm and peaceful atmosphere. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) warned me thus, <br>'Return immediately after observing what they are <br>doing. Do not take any other step.' When I reached the <br>enemy camp, I found a fire burning and people sitting <br>round it. Each person warmed his hands before the fire <br>and then rubbed them over his abdomen. The shouts of <br>retreat were heard from all directions. Every one was <br>shouting to the people of his clan to pack up and go <br>back. The wind was causing the stones to fly and strike <br>against their tents. The guy ropes of the tents were <br>breaking and the animals were dying. I found Abu <br><br>Ch. IX: Pleasing the Prophet <br>S= <br>CI a <br>Sufyan, the Commander-in-Chief of the enemy forces, <br>;% <br>sitting near the fire warming himself. I thought of fin- 33 <br>m<br>ishing him off. I had actually taken out an arrow from <br>my quiver and placed it in my bow, when I remem-<br>bered the directive of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). I put the arrow back into the quiver. While <br>I was among them, they seemed to become aware of <br>my presence. They shouted, 'There is a spy among us. <br>Every one of us should catch the hand of the person <br>next to him I immediately caught the hand of a person <br>and shouted, 'Who are you? 'He said, 'Subhanallah! <br>you do not know me. I am so and so. 'I then returned <br>to my camp. While I was on my way back, I met <br>twenty horsemen with turbans on their heads. They <br>said to me, 'Tell your master that Allah has dealt with <br>his enemy and that he has nothing to worry about <br>now.' Whgn I reached my camp, I found the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying his Salaat with a <br>small shawl around him. Whenever he faced a diffi- <br>~ ~ l l t y .<br>he immediately turned towards Salaat. When he <br>had finished, I reported to him what I had seen in the <br>enemy camp. When I narrated how I escaped their <br>'search for the spy', I could see his beautiful teeth shin- <br>ing. He then asked me to lie down near his feet and put <br>a corner of his shawl over my body.

Alas! our children are brought up in surroundings <br>that draw them away from Islam or at least make them in- <br>different to the duties they owe therein; the results are ob- <br>vious. <br>1. \t Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Tasbih: <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to one of <br>his pupils: <br>\"Shall I tell you the story of Hadhrat Fatimah (Rad- <br>hiyaliaho anha), the dearest and the most loved daugh- <br>ter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When the pupil replied in the affirmative, he said: <br>\"Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) used to grind <br>the grain herself, which caused corns on her hands. <br>She carried water for the house in a leather bag, which <br>left a mark on her breast. She cleaned the house her- <br>self, which made her clothes dirty. Once some war- <br>captives were brought to Madinah. I said to her, 'Go to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and request <br>him for an assistant to help you in your house-work.' <br>She went to him, but found many people round him. <br>As she was very modest, she could not be bold enough <br>to request the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in <br>the presence of other people. Next day the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) came to our house and <br>said, \"Fatimah! what made~you come to me yester- <br>day?'' She felt shy and kept quiet. I said, \"0,Prophet <br>of Allah! Fatimah has developed callusses on both her <br>hands and breast, on account of grinding and carrying <br>water. She is constantly busy in cleaning the house <br>and in other domestic jobs, causing her clothes to <br>remain dirty.

It has also been reported that Hadhrat Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) made a request, 'I and Ali own 31 <br>only one bedding and that also is a skin of a goat. We <br>use it in the morning to put the feed of the camel.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Fatimah! <br>Be patient. The Prophet Moses (Alayhis Salam) and his <br>wife owned only one bedding, which was the cloak of <br>Moses. Fear Allah; acquire Taqwa and keep doing your <br>service to Allah and attend to your domestic jobs. <br>When you go to bed, recite Subhanallah 33 times, Al- <br>hamdulillah 33 times and Allahoakbar 34 times. You <br>will find this more helpful than an assistant.' Hadhrat <br>Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) remarked, 'I am happy <br>with what Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) would be pleased with.\" <br>Look! This is the life of the Prophet's dear daughter. In <br>moderately rich families of our times, the ladies think it <br>below their dignity to attend to domestic work. They need <br>assistance in each and every thing, even in their bathroom! <br>What a difference! <br>In this Hadith, the prescribed Zikr is before sleep. In <br>other Ahadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have advised Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) to recite after every Salaat. Subhanallah 33 times. Al- <br>hamdulillah 33 times, Allahoakbar 33 times and Lailaha-il- <br>lallaho wahdahu-lasharikalahu-lahulmulkuwalahulhamdu-<br>wahuwa-ala-kulli-sha-in-Qadir,<br>once, <br>2, \t<br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending In <br>the Path of Allah. <br>Once Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) received a gift of two <br>bags containing one lakh (100,000)Dirhams. She started <br>distributing these among the poor, till by the evening not a <br>single dirham was left with her. She was fasting that day. <br>Her maid servant brought her a loaf of bread and a little <br>olive oil for Iftar, and remarked, \"I wish we had kept one <br>dirham for ourselves to get some meat for Iftaar.\" Aishah <br>said: <br>\"Do not be sorry now. If you had told me at that time I <br>would have perhaps spared one dirham.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Gifts of this nature were often received by Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) from Amir Muawiah, Hadhrat <br>Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhuma) and others. <br>for that was the time of ease and plenty for the Muslims as <br>territory after territory fell into their hands. In spite of this <br>abundance, Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) led a life <br>of abstention. Look! She distributes 100 000 dirhams to the <br>poor, but she does not remember to get some meat for her <br>own Iftar. In our own atmosphere today, such stories seem <br>to be impossible but, to the people who have understood <br>the Sahabah's frame of mind, hundreds of such incidents <br>are quite credible. There are many stories of this nature re- <br>ported about Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha). Once she was <br>fasting and had nothing for her Iftar except one piece of <br>bread. A poor man came and begged for some food. She <br>asked her maid to give him that piece of bread. The maid <br>said: <br>\"If I give him the piece of bread, there will be nothing <br>left for your Iftar\". <br>She said: \"Never mind. Let him have the piece\". <br>Once she killed a snake. She saw a vision in her <br>dream, saying: \"Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) you killed a <br>Muslim\". <br>She replied: \"How could a Muslim come into the house of <br>the Prophet's widow?\" <br>Thevisionrejoined: \"But he had come in Purdah (dis- <br>guise)\". <br>She abruptly got uptfrom her sleep and at once spent <br>12 000 dirhams in Sadaqah, which was the blood-money <br>fixed for a Muslim killed by mistake. Hadhrat Urwah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once saw Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>spending 70 000 dirhams in charity, while she herself <br>was wearing a dress with patches.\" <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) Gets Angry <br>With Hadhrat Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anhol: <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>Hadhrat Aishah's (Radhiyallaho anha) nephew. He was <br>very dear to her, as she had brought him up. He did not <br>like her spending so much in charity, while she herself <br>5 s<br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6 Spirit for Islam <br>Ll a<br>0sI <br>lived in want and poverty. He mentioned this to somebody -8q <br>and said: <br>m<br>3 m  <br>\"I must stop my aunt from doing that\". <br>She learnt about this and was so much displeased that <br>she swore not to speak to Hadhrat Abdullah for the rest of <br>her life. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was very much shocked by her oath. He deputed many <br>people to speak to her for him, but she told them, \"I have <br>taken an oath and I am not prepared to violate it.\" He, at <br>last, took two persons from the family of the Prophet's <br>mother to her house to intercede for him. Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) allowed the persons to enter the house and <br>to speak to her from behind a curtain. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) also stealthily got in with these persons. <br>When these persons started talking, he could not control <br>himself and crossed the curtain and clung to his aunt, <br>crying and entreating her for pardon. The two persons also <br>interceded and reminded her of the Prophet's forbidding a <br>Muslim from forswearing speech with another Muslim. <br>When she heard this Hadith, she got frightened of Allah's <br>displeasure and the result thereof, and began to weep very <br>bitterly. She forgave Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>and began to speak with him. She then began liberating <br>slave after slave in expiation of her oath, till 40 slaves had <br>been set free by her. Even later on, whenever she thought of <br>the violation of her oath, she wept so much that her shawl <br>would become wet with her tears. <br>How much do we worry about the oaths we take from <br>morning till evening? It is for every one to examine his own <br>self and answer. Come and see the people who had real <br>reverence for Allah and His name; how deeply did they <br>feel.when they were unable to fulfil an oath. We see Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) weeping so much whenever <br>she remembered that incident about the violation of her <br>oath. <br>4. \t<br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and Fear of <br>Allah: <br>Who does not know about the love that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had for his dear wife Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha)? It is said that when he was <br>asked whom he loved most, he replied, \"Aishah\". She was <br>so well-versed in Islamic jurisprudence that many eminent <br>Sahabah would go to her for solving their problems in this <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>1 <br>field. Jibrail used to greet her with 'Assalamo alaikum'. The <br>Prophet once told her that she would be his wife in the Par- <br>adise. When she was slandered by the Munafiqin, Allah <br>exonerated her from the slander and confirmed her inno- <br>cence by revealing verses in the Qur'an. <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once enumerated as <br>many as ten special virtues that Allah had given her over <br>the other wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Her spending in the path of Allah has already been nar- <br>rated in the previous stories. In spite of all these privileges <br>and virtues, she feared Allah so much that she was often <br>heard saying; <br>\"I wish I was a tree, so that I could be always busy in <br>Allah's tasbih and be absolved of reckoning on the Day <br>of Judgment\". <br>\"I wish I had been a stone or a clod of earth\". <br>\"I wish I had been a leaf of tree or a blade of grass\". <br>\"I wish I had not been born at all\". <br>The stories about the awe and fear of Allah, which <br>Sahabah had in their hearts, have already been given in <br>Chapter 11. This was the guiding factor of their lives. <br>5. Story of Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Ummul-Momineen Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was first,married to Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). The husband and wife were very much attached to <br>each other. Once Umme Salmah said to her husband: <br>\"I have heard that if a husband does not marry another <br>woman during the life or after the death of his wife, <br>and also if the wife does not remarry after the death of <br>her husband, the couple when admitted to paradise is <br>allowed to live there as husband and wife. Give me <br>your word that you will not marry after my death, and <br>I too pledge that I will not marry again if you happen <br>to die before me\". <br>Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Will you <br>do as I say?\" <br>She replied: \"Of course\". <br>He said: \"I want you to take a husband after my death\" <br>He then prayed, saying, \"0,Allah! Let Umme Salmah <br>be married after my death to a husband better than I. May <br>he give her no trouble whatsoever\". <br>In the beginning, the couple emigrate'd to Abyssinia. <br>After their return, they again emigrated to Madinah Hadh- <br>rat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"When my husband made up his mind to emigrate to <br>Madinah, he loaded the camel with the luggage. He <br>then made me and our son Salmah ride the camel. He <br>led the camel out of the town, holding the string in his <br>hand. The people of my father's clan (Banu Mughirah) <br>happened to see us leaving. They came and snatched <br>the,string from Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho's) hqnd saying, 'You can go wherever you like <br>but we cannot allow our girl to go and perish with <br>you.' They forcibly took me and my son back to their <br>clan. When the people of my husband's clan (Banu <br>Abdul Asad) learnt this, they came to Banu Mughirah <br>and began to argue with them saying, \"You can keep <br>your girl if you like, but you have no claim over the <br>child who belongs to our clan. Why should we allow <br>him to stay in your clan, when you have not allowed <br>your girl to go with her husband\". They forcibly took <br>the boy away. Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had already gone to Madinah. All the members <br>of the family were thus separated from each other. <br>Daily, I would go out in the desert and weep there <br>from morning till night. I lived in this condition for <br>one full year, separated from my husband and my son. <br>One day, one of my cousins taking pity on me said to <br>the people of the clan, 'You have separated this poor <br>woman from her husband and son. Why don't you <br>have mercy on her and let her go? Due to the humani- <br>tarian efforts of this cousin of mine, the people of Banu <br>Mughirah agreed to let me go and join my husband. <br>Banu Abdul Asad also made over my son to me. I got a <br>camel ready and, with my son in my lap, I sat on its <br>back and set off for Madinah all alone. I had hardly <br>gone four miles, when 'Hadhrat Usman-bin-Talhah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) met me at Tan'eem. He inquired, <br>'Where are you going?' I said, 'To Madinah! He re-<br>marked, 'With none accompanying you!, I said 'No, I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>have nobody except Allah to accompany me.' He took <br>the rope of my camel and began to lead. By Allah, I <br>have never come across a person more noble than <br>Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). When I had to <br>get down, he would make the camel sit and himself go <br>behind a hush and when I had to climb up he would <br>bring the camel and make it sit close to me. He would <br>then hold the rope and lead the animal. Thus we <br>reached Quba (a suburb of Madinah). He informed me <br>that Hadhrat Abu Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>staying there. He then made us over to my husband <br>and then returned all the way back toXMecca. By Allah, <br>no one else could bear the hardships that I bore during <br>that single year\". <br>Look at Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha's) <br>faith and trust.in Allah. She set out on a long and hazard- <br>ous journey all alone. See how Allah sent His help to her. <br>No doubt.Allah can depute anybody to render help to those <br>who place trust in Him, for the hearts of all people are in <br>His control. <br>As a rule, a lady is not permitted to travel alone on a <br>long journey, except in the event of obligatory emigration <br>for the sake of Allah. <br>6. \t<br>Ladies in the Khaibar Campaign: <br>Shoulder to shoulder with their menfolk, the ladies of <br>those times, imbued with the same spirit of sacrifice, were <br>striving heart and soul in the path of Allah, and no service <br>in this c~nnectionwa: too much for them. <br>Hadhrat Umme Ziyad (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"In the Khaibr campaign. I along with other five <br>women reached the battle-field. The Prophet (Sallalaho <br>alaihe wasallam), having learnt this, sent for us. He <br>said with anger. 'Who permitted you to come over <br>here? Who brought you to this place?' We said. '0, <br>Prophet of Allah! we know knitting and we have some <br>medicines with us. We shall help the Mujahidin by <br>supplying them with arrows, by attending them when <br>they are sick, and by preparing food for them.' The <br>Prophet (Sallqllaho alaihe wasallam) permitted us to <br>stay.\" <br>The women of that time were blessed with the spirit <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>which even the men of our times do not possess. Look at <br>the courage of these women who reached the battle-field on <br>their own accord, and who offered to attend tb different <br>jobs in the field. <br>Hadhrat Umme Salim (Radhiyallaho anha) joined thb <br>Huneyn campaign in the state of pregnancy. She kept a <br>dagger on her person. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) inquired: <br>\"What is this dagger for, 0,Omme Salim?\" <br>She replied: \t \"I shall run it through the belly of any Kafir <br>approachingme\". <br>She bad also taken part in'the battle of Uhud. ~herein~she <br>tended the wounds of the fi&ting men. Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) says: <br>\"I saw ~ a d h r a t  Aishah and Hadbat Umme Sglim <br>(Radhi~allaho anhuma) ,running to and fro in the <br>battle-field, carrying water for the wounded\". <br>7. \t<br>Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho Pnha) in the <br>battle for Cyprus: <br>Upme Yaraq (Radhiy llaho anha) was an qunt of <br>Anas'[Radhiyallaho anhi). $hel\"Pophet (Sallallaho'alaihe <br>wasallam) often visited her and sometimes had his after- <br>noon nap at her, place. Once,he was,sleeping in her house, <br>when he woke up smiling. <br>Hadhrat Umme Haiam (Radhiyallaho a+a) said: <br>\"0,Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! You are <br>dearer to .me than my parents, teli me what made you <br>smile\". <br>He said: <br>\"I saw in my dream a few of my followers going for <br>Jihad across the sea. They, in their barges, looked like <br>kings sitting on their thrones\". <br>Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho anhaj said: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Pray that I may also be one <br>among those people\". <br>He replied: \"Rest assured, you will be one of themv <br>He went to sleep again, and got up smiling for the second <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>time. On Hadhrat Haram (Radhiyallaho anha's) query he <br>said: <br>\"I again saw some more people going for Jihad across <br>the sea\". <br>Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho anha) requested him <br>to pray for her joining them also, he said: <br>\"No, you are with the first group only.\" <br>During the Khilafat of Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Amir Muawiyah, the Governor of Syria, sought permission <br>to send an expeditionary force to Cyprus Island. This per- <br>mission was granted by Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyallaho anha), with <br>her husband Hadhrat Ubadah [Radhiyallaho anho), was in <br>that force. While returning from the island she fell from her <br>mule, broke her neck and died. She was buried in Cyprus. <br>Look at the spirit of Hadhrat Umme Haram (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). She wanted to join both the expeditions. As she <br>was destined to die during the first expedition, the Prophet <br>(Sallailaho alaihe wasallam) did not pray for her partici- <br>pation in the second one. <br>8. <br>Story of Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Umme Sulaim [Radhiyallaho anha) was the mother of <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho). After the death of her <br>husband, she remained a widow for some time with a view <br>to devoting herself to the proper upbringing of her son. She <br>was then married to,Hadhrat Abu Talhah [Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and got a son named Abu Umair from him. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to go to her <br>hbuse and play with the child. <br>One day, Abu Umair was ill and Hadhrat Abu Talhah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) was fasting. While Hadhrat Abu <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) was out on his job, the child <br>died. She washed and enshrouded the dead body and laid <br>it on the cot. She then herself took a bath changed her <br>clothes and made her toilet. When the husband returned <br>home and had his Iftar he asked her: <br>\"How is the child?\" <br>'She replied: \"He is now in peace.\" <br>I <br>He was satisfied. The couple shared the bed for the night. <br>I <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>When they got up in the morning, they had the following <br>conversation. <br>Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"I have a question to ask you.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"What is that?\" <br>Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Suppose a person is ,entrusted with something. <br>Should he deliver up on demand that which is en- <br>trusted to him or not?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"He must deliver up. He has no right to hold it back\". <br>Hadhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"Abu Umair was entrusted to us by Allah. He has <br>taken him back.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Ta'lhah (Radhiyallaho anho) was filled with <br>grief. He simply said: <br>\"But why did you not inform me before?\" <br>He went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and narrated the story to him. He prayed for him and said: <br>\"Allah is likely to bless your sharing the bed with your <br>wife last night.\" <br>One of the Sahabah says: <br>\"I lived to see the effect of the Prophet's blessing. As a <br>result of his union with his wife on that night, Hadhrat <br>Abu Talhah (Radhiyallaho anho) got a son named Ab- <br>dullah. This Abdullah had nine sons, all of whom <br>were Qaris.\" <br>It needs much courage and patience to do what Hadh- <br>rat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha) did at the death of <br>her son. She did not like her husband to know about the <br>death of the child while he was fasting and while he <br>needed food and rest. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Umrne Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha's) Be-<br>haviour With Her Fatht~r: <br>Hadhrat Ummul Mominin Umme Habibah (Radhiyal- <br>I <br>laho anha) was previously married to Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. <br>She emigrated with her husband to Abyssinia. The hus- <br>band turned renegade and died there ,as a Kafir. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alhihe wasallam) sent his offer to marry <br>her through king Negus, while she was still passing her <br>days in Abyssinia as a widow. She accepted the offer and <br>came to Madinah to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). During the period of truce between the Muslims <br>and the idolaters of Mecca, her father Hadhrat Abu Sufyan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) once came to Madinah for negotia- <br>tions in connection with reinforcing the truce. He went to <br>see Umme Habibah. As he was about to sit on the bedding <br>in her room, she removed it from under him. He was sur- <br>prised over her behaviour and said: <br>\"Was the bedding unfit for me or I unfit for the bed- <br>ding?\" <br>She replied: \"This bedding is meant for the dear and holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), while you are an <br>idolater pnd therefore unclean. How can I allow you to <br>sit on this bedding?\" <br>Abu Sufyan was full of grief and remarked: <br>I \"Since you left us, you have developed bad manners.\" <br>In the face of the great reverence that she had for the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho al9ihe wasallam), she dould not tolerate <br>an unclean mushrik (though he be her own father) to sit on <br>the Prophet's bedding. <br>Once she came to know from the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about the virtues of twelve rakaats of <br>Chasht. Since that time, she kept on offering this Salaat <br>regularly. <br>Her father Hadhrat Abu Sufyan (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>later embraced Islam. On the third day of his death, she <br>sent for some perfume and bsed it saying: <br>\"I neith'er need nor like the perfume. I have heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A woman <br>is not permitted to mourn the death of any person <br>(except her husband's) for more than three days. (The <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge b Spirit for Islam <br>181 4-4\"1<br>mourning period in case of husband's death is how- <br>ever four months and ten days.) I am using the per- '!J <br>fume simply to show that 1 am not mourning the death <br>of my father any longer.\" <br>When she was about to die, she sent for Hadhrat <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and said: <br>\"We have been rivals in sharing the love of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). It is just possible that we <br>might have offended each other. I forgive .you. Please <br>forgive me too.\" <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said: <br>\"I forgive you by all means. May Allah forgive you <br>too.\" <br>She remarked: <br>\"0, Aishah, you have made me very happy. May Allah <br>keep you happy.\" <br>Similarly, she sent for Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) and secured her forgiveness. <br>The tension between two rival wives is natural and <br>proverbial. Hadhrat Umme Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>wanted to be forgiven by people before she appeared before <br>Allah. Her reverence and love for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) can be judged from her behaviour towards <br>her own father. <br>10. \t The Story of Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>Hadhrat Ummul Mominin Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was a cousin of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>She accepted Islam soon after its advent. In the beginning, <br>she was married to Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho), who <br>was a liberated slave and the adopted son of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He was therefore, known as <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Muhammad (Radhiyallaho anho). Hadh- <br>rat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) could not pull on smoothly <br>with Zainab and at last divorced her. Now, according to the <br>pre-Islamic customs, an adopted son was treated as a real <br>son, so much so that his widow or divorced wife could not <br>be married to his adopted father. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), with a view to break this unjustified <br>custom, communicated to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>anha) his proposal for marriage. When Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) received the proposal, she said: <br>\"Let me consult my Lord!\" <br>She then performed Wudhu and stood up in her Salaat. Her <br>action was so much blessed by Allah that the following <br>verse was revealed to the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>-<br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (hence forth) there mav be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed necessary formality (of <br>release) from them. The commandment of Allah must <br>be fulfilled.\" <br>When Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was in-<br>formed of the good news that Allah had given her in the <br>Prophet's mdrriage and had revealed a verse to that effect, <br>she made over to the reporter in gratification all her jewell- <br>ery that she was wearing at that time. Then she fell down . <br>in Sajdah and vowed to keep fast for two months. She was <br>justly proud of the fact that, while every other wife of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was given in the mar- <br>riage to him by her relations, she was given by Allah, as <br>mentioned in Qur'an! As Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was also proud of being the most beloved wife; of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), there was always <br>some rivalry between the two. In spite of all this, when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha's) opinion about Hadhrat Aishah (Kad- <br>hiyallaho anha) in the matter of the slander against Hadhrat <br>r <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), she said: <br>\"I find everything good in Aishah.\" <br>Look at her integrity and strong character. Had she <br>i <br>wished, she could have harmed the reputation of her rival <br>and lowered her, in the eyes of their common husband, <br>who loved Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) so much. <br>On the other hand, she praised her in very strong words. <br>8 3<br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was a very pious <br>.=% <br>lady. She fasted very often and would say her Nafl Salaat <br>Wm <br>very frequently. She earned by working with her hands, <br>and spent all that she earned in the path of Allah. <br>At the time of the Prophet's death, his wives asked <br>him: <br>\"Which of us will join you first?\" <br>Me said: \"The one with long arms.\" <br>They began to measure their arms with a stick. They, how- <br>ever, came to know later that long hands symbolised lavish <br>spending in charity. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was indeed the first to die after the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). <br>Hadhrat Barazah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>Hadhrat \"Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) decided to pay an <br>annual allowance to the Ummahat-ul-Mominin from <br>the Baitul Maal. He sent 12 000 dirhams to Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) through me as her share. <br>She thought that it was for all of them, and said to me, <br>'Umar should have asked somebody else to distribute <br>this money.' I said, 'It is the annual share for you <br>alone.' She asked me to throw it in the corner of a <br>room and cover it with a piece of cloth. Then she men- <br>tioned the names of some poor persons. widows and <br>her relatives, and asked me to give one handful to each <br>of them. After I had distributed as desired, some <br>money was still left under the cloth. I expressed a <br>desire to have something for myself. She said, 'You <br>take the rest.' I counted the money. It was eighty four <br>dirhams. Then she lifted her hands in prayer and said, <br>'0,Allah keep this money away from me, for it brings <br>temptation.' She died before the allowance for the next <br>year could be paid to her. When Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know of what she had done <br>with the money, he sent her another 1000 dirhams for <br>her personal needs but even those she spent in no <br>time. Although during the last portion of her life, the <br>Muslims were conquering territory after territory, and <br>wealth was pouring into Madinah, yet she left no <br>money or other wealth after her, except the house <br>where she lived. She was called Ma'wal Masaakeen, <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>(refuge of the poor), due to her lavish spending in <br>charity.\" <br>A woman narrates: <br>\"I and Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) were <br>dyeing our clothes with red ochre. The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) came in, but went out again <br>when he saw us engaged ih dyeing. Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) felt that the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had perhaps not liked our dyeing in <br>that colour. She immediately washed all the dyed <br>clothes till their colour was gone.\" <br>Everybody knows the love and liking of women for <br>money and colours. But look at these ladies, who would <br>push away the money coming to them and who were pre- <br>pared to discard any colour on receiving the least hint of <br>the Prophet's disapproval. <br>11. \t Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) Exhorts Her <br>Sons to Bravery. <br>Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) was a famous po- <br>etess. She embraced Islam in Madinah, along with some <br>others of her clan. Ibn Athir writes: <br>\"All masters of literature are unanimous in declaring <br>I-iadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho anha) as the best <br>woman poet in Arabic. No woman in history has ever <br>written such poetry as Hadhrat Khansa (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) .\" <br>? <br>During the time of 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>16 A.H, the famous hattle of Qadisivyah was fought be- <br>tween the Muslims and the Persians. Hadhrat Khansa (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha), along with her four sons, took part in this <br>battle. On the eve of the battle, she exhorted all her four <br>sons, saying: <br>I <br>\"0, My sons! You embraced Islam and emigrated of <br>your own free will. By Allah, beside Whom there is no <br>God, you all are the sons of the same father, just as you <br>are the sons of the same mother. I never betrayed your <br>,* <br>father, nor defamed your maternal uncle. I never al- <br>lowed a blot to come on your high birth nor polluted <br>your pedigree.

Endure, outdo all others in endur- <br>ance, be ready and observe your duty to Allah, in order <br>that Ye may succeed. (III:200)\" <br>When you get up tomorrow morning, be prepared to <br>contribute your best in the battle. Go ahead into the <br>enemy lines, seeking help from Allah. When you see <br>the flames of war rising high, get right into the centre <br>and face the enemy chiefs. Inshallah you will get your <br>abode in paradise with honour and success.\" <br>Next day, when the battle was in full swing, all the <br>four sons.advanced towards the enemy lines. One by one, <br>they attacked the enemy, reciting the words of their mother <br>in verses and fought till all of them were martyred. When <br>the mother got the news, she said: <br>\"Alhamdulillah. Glory to Allah Who has honoured me <br>with their martyrdom. I hope that Allah will unite me <br>with them under the shade of His Mercy.\" <br>Here is a mother of that time. She exhorts her sons to <br>jump into the flames of battle and, when all the sons are <br>killed in quick succession, she glorifies Allah and thanks <br>Him. <br>12. \t Hadhrat Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) Kills A Jew <br>Hadhrat Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the aunt of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and a real sister of <br>Hadhrat Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho). She took part in the <br>battle of Uhud. When the Muslims were defeated and some <br>of them began to flee from the battle, she would smite their <br>faces with her spear and excite them to go back and fight. <br>In the war of the Khandaq (Trench), the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had collected all the Muslim <br>women in a fortress and had deputed Hadhrat Hassaan bin <br>Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) to look after them. The Jews, <br>who were always on the look-out for such opportunities for <br>doing mischief, surrounded the place and sent one of them <br>3,<br>'a <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>to find out if there were any men with the ladies. Hadhrat <br>Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anha) happened to see the Jew ap- <br>proaching the fort. She said to Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"There is a Jew coming to spy on us. You go out and <br>kill him.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was a weak person. <br>He did not make bold to do the job. Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) got hold of a tent peg and went outside the fortress <br>and gave a blow on the head of the Jew that killed him on <br>the spot. She came back and said to Hassaan: <br>\"The man is dead. I have not removed the clothes and <br>arms from his body for reasons of modesty. Now you <br>go and remove everything from his body. Also bring <br>his head after severing it from the body.\" <br>Hadhrat Hassaan (Radhiyallaho anho) was too weak-<br>hearted to do that even. She herself went again and brought <br>his head, and threw it over the wall amidst the Jews. When <br>they saw this, they said: <br>\"We were wondering how Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) could keep the womenfolk alone in <br>this fort. Surely, there are men inside to guard the <br>ladies.\" <br>Safiyyah died in 20 A.H. at the age of seventy three. <br>The war of the Trench was fought in 5 A.H. She was, there- <br>fore, 58 then. These days, a lady of that age is hardly able <br>to do her domestic work. But look how Saffiyyah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) goes and kills a Jew all alone. <br>13. \t ZIadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha's) Interview With <br>the Pmphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Regarding <br>the Reward for Women. <br>Hadhrat Asrna birityazid Ansari (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than my <br>parents. My Muslim women have deputed me as their <br>representative to talk to you on their behalf. Verily you <br>are the Prophet of Allah for both men and women. We <br>stay for most part of our time within the four walls of <br>our houses. We remain pinned to our duties of fulfil- <br>ling the sexual desires of men, bearing children for <br><br>187 2%<br>a<br>Ch.

Notwithstanding <br>.CM 43 <br>all this, men excel us in getting rewards for things <br>s m  <br>which we are unable to do. They go and say their daily <br>Salaat and weekly Jumu'ah in the musjid, visit the <br>sick, attend the funerals, perform Hajj after Hajj and, <br>above all, fight in the way of Allah. When they go for <br>Hajj or Jehad, we look after their property, bring up <br>their children and weave cloth for them. Do we not <br>share their rewards with them?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) addressing the <br>Sahabah sitting round him, said: <br>\"Did you ever hear a woman asking a better question?\" <br>Sahabah replied: \"0, Prophet of Allah! We never thought <br>that a woman could ever put such a <br>question.\" <br>The Pmphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) addressing Asma <br>said: <br>\"Listen attentively, and then go and tell the ladies who <br>have sent you that when a woman seeks the pleasure <br>of her husband and carries out her domestic functions <br>to his satisfaction, she gets the same reward as the men <br>get for all their services to Allah.\" <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) returned very happily <br>after getting this reply to her question. <br>Obedience to and good behaviour towards husbands is <br>a very great asset for the women, provided they know its <br>value. <br>The Sahabah once said to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam): <br>\"In foreign countries, people prostrate before their <br>kings and chiefs. You deserve such reverence much <br>more.\" <br>He said, \"No. If it were permissible to prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah. I would asked the women to <br>prostrate before their husbands.\" <br>He then said, <br>\"By him Who has my life in His hand, a woman <br>cannot do what she owes to Allah until she has done <br>what she owes to her husband.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>It is reported in a Hadith that once a camel bowed in <br>prostration before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Sahabah on seeing this, said: <br>\"When this animal prostrates before you, why should <br>we not have this honour too?\" <br>He replied: <br>\"Never. If I could make somebody prostrate before any- <br>body besides Allah, I would ask the wives to prostrate <br>before their husbands.\" <br>The following is reported to have been said by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in this connection: <br>(1) \"A woman whose husband is pleased with her at <br>the time of her death goes straight into Paradise.\" <br>(2) \t \"A woman is cursed by the angels if her husband <br>is displeased with her, and she stays away from <br>him in anger for the night.\" <br>(3) \t \"The Salaat of two persons hardly rises beyond <br>their heads in its flight to heaven. These two per- <br>sons are a run-away slave and a disobedient wife.\" <br>14. \t The Story of Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha) is one <br>of those Ansar who embraced Islam in the very beginning. <br>She was among the group that vowed allegience to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at Al-Aqabah. Al- <br>Aqabah in Arabic means a narrow Mountain Pass. In the <br>early days of Islam, the new Muslims were persecuted by <br>Qureysh very badly. They would put all hurdles in the way <br>of Tabligh. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), there- <br>fore, carried on his mission quietly and secretly. People <br>from Madinah who used to come to Mecca for Hajj usually <br>embraced Islam secretly in a mountain pass near Mina, so <br>that Qureysh might not see them. She was in the third such <br>group from Madinah. She participated in most of the <br>battles that were fought after emigration. She took promi- <br>nent part in Uhud, Hudeybiah, Khaiber. Umratul Qadha, <br>Huneyn and Yamamah. <br>In the battle of Uhud, she was forty-three. Her husband <br>and two sons were also fighting in the battle. She took a <br><br>0 9  <br>Q) <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>189 $ 3  <br>8 2 <br>leather bottle full of water and headed for Uhud. In the be- <br>.e <br>ginning, the Muslims had an upper hand, but the tables g*<br>were turned in another moment and the enemy were in the <br>winning position. She had reached the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), when wave after wave of enemy troops <br>rushed to attack and kill him. She shielded the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) whenever anybody ap-<br>proached him. She had a cloth-belt round her waist full of <br>pieces of lint. She tended the wounded. She herself got <br>about twelve wounds, one of which was very serious. <br>Hadhrat Umme Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I once saw a very deep cut on the shoulder of Hadhrat <br>Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha). I inquired how <br>she had got that. She said, 'I got it in Uhud. When <br>people were running about in confusion, I saw Ibn <br>Qumiah coming towards us and shouting, 'where is <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Let some-<br>body tell me his whereabouts. If he is saved today, I <br>am no more.' I, Hadhrat Mus'ab bin Umair (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some others intercepted him. He gave <br>me this deep cut on my shoulder. I also attacked him, <br>but he escaped on account of the double coat of mail <br>that he was wearing.\" <br>In spite of a year's treatment, the wound would not heal. In <br>the meantime, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) de- <br>cided about the expedition to Hamra-ul-Asad. Hadhrat <br>Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anha) also got ready to join <br>the expedition. But as her wound was still unhealed, she <br>could not participate. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) returned from the expedition, he straight away <br>went to visit Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). He was very happy to find her better. <br>She says: <br>\"In fact, we were very much handicapped in Uhud. <br>The enemy had very strong cavalry, while we fought <br>on foot. There would have been a fair fight if they too <br>had been on foot. When somebody came riding on his <br>horse to attack me, I stopped his sword on my shield <br>and when he turned about, I attacked his horse from <br>the rear and cut its leg. This caused the horse as well <br>as the rider to fall on the ground. As soon as this hap- <br>pened, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>shout to my son, who would run to my help and then <br>we both finished the man in no time.\" <br>Her son Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: <br>\"I had a wound on my left arm, which would not stop <br>bleeding. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said to my mother, 'Put a bandage over it.' My mother <br>took out a bandage from her belt and after bandaging <br>f'<br>my wound, said, 'Now, son. go and fight again with <br>the idolaters.' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was watching us. He said, '0, Umme Ammarah, <br>who can have courage like yours?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at that time <br>prayed again and again for Hadhrat Umme Ammarah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) and her family. Hadhra: Umme Ammarah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was standing with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), when one of the enemy passed in front of me. <br>The Pro~;?et (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] said to me, <br>Umme Ammarah! He is the man who wounded your <br>son.' I jumped at hirn and hit his leg. It made him fall <br>down. We then went foiward and finished him. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) smiled and said, <br>'Umme Ammarah has avenged her son.' When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was praying for <br>us, I said to him, '0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for my <br>company with you in Paradise.' He favoured me with <br>this prayer too, and after that I cared little for what <br>happened to me ,in this life.\" <br>As has already been said, she also participated in <br>many other battles with the same zeal and spirit. After the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she took <br>part in the fierce battle of Yamamah, which was fought <br>with the renegades. She lost one of her arms and received <br>eleven other wounds in this battle. She was forty-three in <br>Uhud and fifty-two in Yamamah. Her heroism in these <br>battles at that age was really miraculous. <br>15. \t Story of Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>Hadhrat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) was the <br>wife of Ikramah bin Abi Jahl. She participated in Uhud on <br>the enemy side. She embraced Islam on the fall of Mecca. <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6. Spirit for Islam <br>She loved her husband very much, who would not become <br>a Muslim on account of his father, who was the worst <br>enemy of Islam. After the fall of Mecca, her husband fled to <br>Yemen. She secured pardon for him from the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and went to Yemen and induced <br>her husband to return to his home. She told him: <br>\"You can be safe from the sword of Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) only when you put yourself in <br>his lap.\" <br>She returned with him to Madinah, where Ikramah em-<br>braced Islam and the couple began to live together happily. <br>They both participated in the Syrian war during the caliph- <br>ate of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). Ikmmah was <br>killed in a battle. She was then married to another wuja- <br>hid, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). It was <br>at a place called Marja-us-Safr that her husband wanted to <br>meet her. She said: <br>\"We have enemy concentrating on all fronts. We shall <br>meet after they are done away with.\" <br>He said: \"I am sure I shall not survive this battle.\" <br>They then shared the bed for the first time in a tent at that <br>place. Next day, Hadhrat Khalid bin Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was arranging for the Walimah when the enemy at- <br>tacked with full force and he was killed in the battle. Hadh- <br>rat Umme Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) packed up her tent <br>and other luggage, and, with a tent-peg in her hand, fought <br>the enemy till she had killed seven of them. <br>In war times, not to speak of a woman, no man would <br>like to get married under such circumstances. Look at her <br>marriage in the battle-field and her fight with the enemy! <br>Instead of mourning the loss of her husband on the day of <br>his death, she rushes in to the battle-field and kills seven of <br>the enemy soldiers single-handed. Is this not enough to <br>show the wonderful strength of Iman in women of that <br>time? <br>16. \t Martyrdom of Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) is the mother <br>of 'Hadhrat Ammar (Radhiyallaho anho), whose story we <br>have already read in Chapter V. Just like 'Hadhrat Ammar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) her son, and Yasir her husband, she <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>patiently bore the hardships in various forms in the cause <br>i <br>of Islam. She would not weaken in her love for and devo- <br>tion to Islam in spite of all these afflictions. One day, <br>Hadhrat Sumayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) was standing <br>when Abu Jahl passed that way. He flung all sorts of dirty <br>words at her and then put his spear through her private <br>parts. She died on account of the wound. She is the first to <br>meet martyrdom for the cause of Islam. <br>Patience, perseverence and sacrifice of these ladies are <br>really enviable. No affliction is too much when a person <br>blessed with the spirit of Islam is determined to bear it. We <br>hear about hundreds of persons dying for one cause or the <br>other. It is only dying for the cause of Allah that brings <br>eternal happiness and comfort in the life to come. Persons <br>losing their lives for material gains really lose twice, i.e., in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. <br>17. The story of Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha). <br>Hadhrat Asma bint Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anha) is <br>the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>mother of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and step-sister of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha). She is one of the famous women of her time. She <br>was the eighteenth person to embrace Islam. She was <br>twenty-seven years old at the time of the Hijrat. After the <br>migration from Mecca, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reached Madinah safely, they sent Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and some other Sahabah to bring their families <br>from Mecca. Hadhrdt Asma (Radhiyallaho anho) came to <br>Madinah with Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>family. When she reached Quba, she gave birth to Hadh- <br>rat-Abdullah <br>bin-Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho), the first <br>Muslim baby born since the Hijrat. She says: <br>\"When I was married to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), he had neither money nor property of any kind. <br>He had only one camel for carrying water and one <br>horse. I would bring fodder for the animals and date- <br>stones to feed them in lieu of grass, bring water from <br>the well, mend bucket myself when needed, and <br>attend to other domestic duties. Attending to the horse <br>was the most difficult of all jobs. I was not good at <br>baking and, therefore, after kneading the flour, I would <br>Ch. X :  Women's Courage S. Spirit for Islam <br>take it to Ansar women in my neighbourhood, who <br>would bake bread for me. When we arrived in Madi- <br>nah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) alloted a <br>piece of land to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>two miles away from the town. I would bring date <br>stones from there on my head. One day when I was <br>coming in this fashion, I met the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) with a group of Ansar in the way. He <br>stopped his camel. From his gesture, I understood that <br>he intended to give me a lift. I felt shy of going with <br>men, and I also remembered that Hadhrat Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was very sensitive in this matter. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) understood my <br>hesitation and left me alone. When I reached home, I <br>narrated the story to Hadhrat Zubair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and told him that, due to my own shyness and <br>his sensitiveness, I did not avail of the offer of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'By <br>Allah I am more sensitive about your carrying the load <br>over such a long distance, but I cannot help it. (In fact, <br>Sahabah remained occupied in striving in the path of <br>Allah and all other such jobs had to be done by their <br>womenfolk. Sometime later, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) transferred to us a servant that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given to him. <br>I was therefore relieved of attending to the horse, <br>which had been really very hard for me.\" <br>18. \t Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) Pacifies her <br>Grandfather. <br>When Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) emi- <br>grated to Madinah in the company of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), he took with him all his money, <br>thinking that the Prophet might need it. It was about 6 000 <br>dirhams. After his departure, his father Abu Quhafah (who <br>was blind and who had not till then accepted Islam) came <br>to express his synlpathy with his granddaughters. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Our grandfather came to us and said, 'Your father has <br>shocked you with his migration to Madinah, and <br>seems to have put you to further hardship by taking all <br>his money with him.' I said, 'No grandfather, do not <br>worry. He has left a lot of money for us.' I collected <br>some pebbles and deposited them in the recess where <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>my father used to keep his money; I covered it with a <br>cloth. I then took my grandfather to the place and <br>placed his hand over the cloth. He thought that the <br>recess was really full of dirhams. He remarked: 'It is <br>good that he has left something for you to live on.' By <br>Allah, my father had not left a single dirham for us: I <br>played this trick simply to pacify my grandfather.\" <br>Look at this brave Muslim girl. Strictly speaking, the <br>girls needed more consolation than their grandfather. <br>Judged by normal course of things, they should have com- <br>plained of their destitution to their grandfather to win his <br>sympathy, as there was nobody else in Mecca to extend <br>them any sympathy or help. But Allah had given such a <br>frame of mind to Muslim men and women of those days <br>that everything they did was really wonderful and worthy <br>of emulation. <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was quite a <br>well-to-do person in the beginning, but he always spent lib- <br>erally in the path of Allah. At the time of Tabuk, he con- <br>tributed all that he possessed (This we have already read in <br>Chapter VI). The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once <br>said: <br>\"No body's wealth has benefited me so much as that of <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). I have com- <br>pensated everybody for the good done to me, except <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). He shall be <br>compensated by Allah Himself.\" <br>19. \t Hadhrat Asma '(Radhiyallaho anha's) Spending in <br>Charity. <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the path of Allah. In the beginning, <br>she used to spend carefully with measure and weight. Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to her: <br>\"0,Asma, do not put by and be calculating; spend in <br>the path of Allah liberally.\" <br>After this, she started spending most generously. She <br>would advise her daughters and house maids: <br>\"Don't wait for any surplus or excess' of requirements <br>before spending in the path of Allah. As the require- <br>ments go on increasing in the chances of having some- <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>thing, excess will become more and more remote, and <br>the time for spending in the path of Allah will never <br>come. Remember that you will not lose by spending in <br>charity.\" <br>Although these people were poor and lived hand to <br>mouth, yet they were liberal in spending and generous of <br>heart. The Muslims today complain of their poverty, but <br>there will be hardly any group op people among them who <br>are so poor and needy as the Sahabah used to be. We have <br>already read how they had to go without food for several <br>days together, and how some of them had to keep stones <br>tied on their bellies to relieve their pangs of hunger. <br>20. \t The Story of the Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's <br>Daughter Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was born after <br>five years of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>marriage to Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), when <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was thirty years of <br>age. She came of age and then accepted Islam. She was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. Her husband <br>fought in Badr for Qureysh and fell a captive to the Mus- <br>lims. <br>When the Qureysh were paying ransom to secure re- <br>lease of their prisoners, Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) gave over as ransom for her husband the necklace <br>she had received in dowry from her mother Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha). When the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saw the necklace, the memories of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) came to his mind and <br>tears were in his eyes. After consultation with Sahabah, he <br>returned the necklace to Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho <br>ahna) and released her husband without ransom on the <br>condition that he would send Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) to Madinah on his return to Mecca. Two men <br>were sent to stay outside Mecca and bring Hadhrat Zainab <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) safely to Madinah, when she was <br>made over to them. Her husband asked his brother Kinanah <br>to take Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) outside Mecca <br>and make her over to the Muslim escort. As Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) and Kinanah were moving out <br>of the town on camel's back, the Qureysh sent a party to in- <br>tercept them. Her own cousin Habar bin Aswad flung a <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>spear at her, which wounded her and made her fall from <br>the camel. As she was pregnant, she had an abortion. Kina- <br>nah started sending arrows towards the interceptors, when <br>Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"We cannot tolerate the daughter of Muhammad leav- <br>ing Mecca so openly. Let her go back and you can send <br>her secretly after a few days.\" <br>Kinanah agreed. Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>despatched after a few days. She suffered from this wound <br>for a long time, till at last she died of the same in 8 A. H. <br>The Prophet said at the time of her death: <br>\"She was my best daughter, for she has suffered much <br>on my account.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) buried her with <br>his own hands. As he went into the grave to lay her down, <br>he looked very sorrowful but, when he came out of the <br>grave, he was quite composed. On the query by the Saha- <br>bah, he said: <br>\"In view of the feebleness of Zainab, I prayed to Allah <br>to remove from her the tortures of the grave, and this <br>prayer has been answered by Allah.\" <br>Just imagine, even the daughter of the Prophet who <br>sacrificed her life for Islam needed a prayer from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for protection from <br>difficulties in the grave. What about us people who are so <br>much steeped in sins? It is but necessary that we should <br>always seek protection from the difficulties in the grave. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often seek <br>refuge in Allah from the horrors of the grave. This was all <br>for the instruction of his followers. (0,Allah! protect us <br>from the horrors of the grave by Thy special Favour. Grace <br>and Bounty). <br>I<br>*,+;C, & i;Chi;, r;611, <br>21. Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) High-minded- <br>ness: <br>Rubayyi-bint-Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha) was a <br>woman of Ansar, who had participated in many battles, by <br>the side of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>nursed the wounded and carried the dead bodies during <br>i <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>197 3<br>h= <br>0s <br>the battle. She had accepted Islam before the Prophet emi- <br>'G8 a <br>grated to Madinah. She was married when the Prophet was <br>~m <br>in Madinah. He graced her marriage with his presence. He <br>'\" <br>heard some girls singing an epic poem about the battle of <br>Badr at her place. One of them sang a verse, which meant: <br>\"We have among us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), who knows what is to happen tomorrow.\" <br>He stopped her from saying such things , because nobody <br>except Allah knows what is going to happen in future. <br>It was Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) father <br>Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anho) who was one of <br>those who killed Abu Jahl in Badr. Abu Jahl, as we know, <br>was one of the big chiefs of Qureysh and the worst enemy <br>of Islam. There was a woman named Asma who used to <br>sell perfumes to the ladies. She once came to Hadhrat Ru- <br>bayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) to sell perfume. When Hadhrat <br>Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) was introduced to her as the <br>daughter of Hadhrat Mu'awiz (Radhiyallaho anha), she re- <br>marked: <br>\"So you are the daughter of him who killed his chief.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha's) high mind could <br>not tolerate the wretched person like Abu Jahl to be men- <br>tioned as the chief of her father. She, therefore, retorted: <br>\"No. I am the daughter of one who killed his slave.\" <br>Asma did not like this epithet for Abu Jahl, and said with <br>anger: <br>\"It is haram for me to sell perfume to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho hnha) said, in the same <br>strain, <br>\"It is haram for me to buy perfume from you. I have <br>never found stink in any. perfume except yours.\" <br>Hadhrat Rubayyi (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I had used the last words simply to provoke her.\" <br>Look at her sensitiveness and feeling for Islam. She could <br>not tolerate an enemy of Islam being mentioned as a chief. <br>We hear from the lips of Muslims most flowery and high <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>sounding epithets being used for the open enemies of <br>Islam. When they are reminded, they call it narrow-mind- <br>f<br>edness. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>i <br>\"Don't call a Munafiq a chief. You displease Allah <br>when you take him as a chief.\" <br>22. Life Sketches of Ummuhat-ul-Momineen: <br>Every Muslim likes to know (and he must know) about <br>the members of the family of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). A very brief account of their lives is, therefore, <br>given in the following pages. The Muhaddithin and histori- <br>ans all agree that eleven ladies had the honour of being the <br>wives of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>b<br>(1)Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the first <br>among them. At the time of her marriage, she was 40 years <br>old and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>twenty-five. She begot all his children, except a son, Ibra- <br>him. <br>She was first to be married to Waraqah bin Naufal, but <br>this marriage could not take place. Her first husband was <br>Atiq bin Aa'iz. She had a daughter from him, whose name <br>was Hind. H'nd grew up and embraced Islam, and she was <br>the mother o \\ many children. On the death of Atiq. Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anha) was married to Abu Halah and got <br>two children from him viz. Hind and Halah. Hind lived up <br>to the time of Ali's Caliphate. On the dzath of Abu Halah, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her as his <br>first wife. She died in Ramadhan of the 10th year of the <br>mission at the age df sixty-five. He loved her very much <br>and did not marry any other woman during her life time. <br>She was populprly called Tahirah (Clean and pure) even <br>before Islam. Her children from other husbands are there- <br>fore known as Banu Tahirah. Her virtues and privileges <br>have been mentioned extensively (in Hadith). The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) laid her in the grave with his <br>own hands. The funeral service had not till then been en- <br>joined. <br>(2)Hadhrat Sauda (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>L. <br>Hadhrat Sauda bint Zam'ah bin Qais (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) was previously married to her cousin Hadhrat <br>Sukran bin 'Amor (Radhiyallaho anho). The couple em- <br>braced Islam and emigrated to Abysinnia. Hadhrat Sukran <br><br>Ch. X:Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>199 3<br>CI0 43 <br>.!2 m <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) died in Abyssinia. Hadhrat Saudah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha), now a widow, returned to Mecca. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), on the death of Hadh- <br>rat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha) (in Shawwal of the same <br>year), married Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha). We <br>know the devotion of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in his salaat. Once Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) stood after him in Tahajjud. The next day she said to <br>him: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Last night you took so long in <br>your Ruk'u that I apprehended bleeding from my <br>nose.\" <br>(As she was bulky, the strain might have been too much for <br>her). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once in-<br>tended to divorce her. As meanwhile Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) had also been married to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she said: <br>\"G,Prophet of Allah! I am ready to forego my turn in <br>favour of Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha), but I <br>don't like to be divorced (by you). I wish to be in Par- <br>adise as one of your wives.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to this <br>suggestion. She died in about 55 A. H. towards the end of <br>the Khilafat of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>There was another Qureysh woman of the same name. <br>She was also a widow having about six children. The <br>Prophet offered to marry her, but she said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than any <br>other person in this world. I do not like my children to <br>be a nuisance to you.\" <br>He appreciated this, and withdrew the offer. <br>(3)Hadhrat A.ishah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) too was married <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in Swawwal of <br>the 10th year of the Nubuwwat. She was born in the 4th <br>year of Nubuwwat and was married when she was six, but <br>was actually sent by her parents to live with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) after his emigration to Madi- <br>nah, when she was nine. She was eighteen at the time of <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>thes Prophet Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's death. She died <br>on the night of Tuesday, the 17th Ramadhan, 57 A. H., at <br>the age of sixty-six. She desired at the time of her death <br>that she might be buried, along with other Ummahat-ul- <br>Momineen, in the public graveyard, though she could be <br>buried by the side of the Prophet's grave, which was in her <br>house. She was the only wife of the Prophet who had not <br>been married previously. All the remaining wives had <br>either been widowed or divorced (some quite a few times) <br>before they became Ummuhat-ul-Momineen. To be married <br>in Shawwal was considered a bad omen among the Arab <br>women. Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"I was married in Shawwal. It was also Shawwal when <br>I was sent to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasailam). Which of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam's) wives has been more blessed with his love <br>! <br>and Allah's other favours than me?\" <br>Oh the death of Hadhrat Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), <br>Hadhrat Khaulah bint Hakim (Radhiyallaho anha) came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Don't you like to marry again?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Whom can I marry?\" <br>Khaylah: <br>\"I know one virgin and one widow.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Name them.\" <br>Khaulah: <br>t <br>\"The virgin is Aishah, (Radhiyallaho anha) the daugh- <br>ter of your bosom friend Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), and the widow is Saudah bint Zam'ah.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"All right! You may make the proposal.\" <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anha) then went to <br>Hadhrat Aisha (Radhiyallaho anha's) mother Hadhrat <br>Umme-Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha) and said to her: <br>C <br>\"I have come with good tidings for your family.\" <br>Hadhrat Umme Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"What is that?\" <br><br>.C <br>Ch. X: Women's Courage & Spirit for Islam <br>201 2a <br>LI0sa <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>8 :  <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has sent me $d<br>* <br>to seek Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha's) hand for <br>him\" <br>Hadhrat Umme Rooman (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>\"But 'Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) is like his <br>niece. How can she be married to him? Let me consult <br>her father.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was not at <br>home at that time. When he came, the proposal was placed <br>before him, and he expressed the same difficulty. Hadhrat <br>Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anho) returned to the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) and apprised him of their diffi- <br>culty. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Abu Bakr is my bosom friend and brother-in-Islam, <br>but this does not forbid my marrying his daughter.\" <br>Hadhrat Khaulah (Radhiyallaho anho) went and informed <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) accordingly. Abu <br>Bakr (Kadhiyallaho anho) was extremely glad to call the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to his home and per- <br>form Aishah's (Radhiyallaho anha) Nikah with him. A few <br>months later, when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had emigrated to Madinah, Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) said to the Prophet: <br>\"Why don't you have your wife Hadhrat Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to live with you?\" <br>He said: \"I have to make some preparations, etc., before I <br>do that.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) presented him with <br>some money, with which necessary things were arranged. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anho) then started living <br>with the Prophet from Shawwal of 1 or 2 A. H. She shared <br>the bed with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for <br>the first time in Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho's) <br>house. <br>These are the three marriages, which the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had before Hijrah. All the remain- <br>ing wives were taken by him in Madinah. <br>(4) Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>Hafsah was the daughter of 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>laho anho) who was born in Mecca five years before the <br>Nubuwwat. She was first married to Hadhrat Khunais bin <br>Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho), who was one of the very <br>early Muslims. He first emigrated to Abyssinia and then to <br>Madinah. He participated in Badr, and was fatally <br>wounded in Badr (or in Uhud) and died of the wound in <br>the year 1 or 2 A. H. Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had also emigrated to Madinah with her husband. When <br>her husband died, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went <br>to Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and said: <br>\"I want to give Hafsah in marriage to you.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) kept quiet and said <br>nothing. Meanwhile Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anho) the <br>daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and <br>the wife of 'Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) died. <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to Hadhrat <br>Usman (Radhiyailaho anho) and offered Hadhrat Hafsah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho's) hand to him. He declined by saying. <br>\"I have no mind to marry for the present.\" 'Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) complained of this to the Prophet. The <br>Prophet said: <br>\"I tell you of a husband for Hafsah better than 'Usman, <br>and of a wife for 'Usma.n better than Hafsah.\" <br>He then took Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anho) as his <br>next wife, and gave his own daughter Hadhrat Umme <br>Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) in marriage to 'Hadhrat (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) Usman. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) later said to 'Hadhrat 'Usman Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>I <br>\"When you offered Hafsah's hand to me, I kept quiet as <br>the Prophet had expressed to me his intention of mar- <br>rying her. I could neither accept your offer nor disclose <br>the Prophet's secret to you. I, therefore. kept quiet. If <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had changed <br>his mind, I would have gladly married her.\" <br>'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abu Bakr's silence over the offer was in fact more <br>shocking to me than 'Usman's rejection.\" <br>Hadhrat Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha) was a very pious <br>woman, and very much devoted to Salaat. She would often <br>fast during the day and spend the night in prayers. Once <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage b Spirit for Islam <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), for some reason, <br>was displeased with Hafsah and even pronounced the first <br>divorce to her. 'Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was na- <br>turally very much shocked over this. Jibra-eel Alayhis came <br>to the Prophet (Sallal Salaam laho alaihe wasallam) and <br>said: <br>\"Allah wants you to take Hafsah back, as she is fasting <br>often and spending her nights in Salaat, and also Allah <br>wants it for Hadhrat Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>sake.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) therefore <br>took her back. She died in Jamadil oola, 45 A. H., at the age <br>of 63. <br>(5) Hadhrat Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) was the next to be <br>married to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). There <br>are divergent reports about her previous husbands. Accord- <br>ing to one report, she was first married to Hadhrat Abdul- <br>lah bin Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anho) who was killed in Uhud, <br>as we have already seen in his story in chapter VI1. Accord-<br>ing to another report, she was first married to Tufail ibnul <br>a1 Harith and when divorced by him was remarried to <br>his brother Ubaidah ibnul Harith, who was killed in Badr. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her in <br>Ramadhan, 3 A. H. She lived with the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) for eight months only, as she died in <br>Rabi-ul-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Zainab and Hadhrat Khadi- <br>jah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) are the two wives of the <br>Prophet who died during his life time. All the other wives <br>lived on after him and died later. Hadhrat Zainab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) spent very liberally on the poor, and was <br>known as 'Ummul Masakin' (mother of the poor) even <br>before Islam. <br>After her death, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) married Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha). <br>(6) Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Ummayvah. <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). She was first married to her cousin <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdul Asad known as Abu Salamah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). The couple embraced Islam in the <br>very beginning and emigrated to Abyssinia, due to the per- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>secutions of Qureysh. A son was born to them in exile, who <br>was named Salamah. After returning from Abyssinia, the <br>family emigrated to Madinah. Hadhrat Umme Salamah's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) story about her journey to Madinah <br>has been already given in the early part of the chapter. <br>After reaching Madinah, Hadhrat Umme Salmah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) got another son 'Umar and two daughters, <br>Durrah and Zainab (Radhiyallaho anhum). Hadhrat Abu <br>Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) was the eleventh man to em- <br>brace Islam. He participated in the battle of Badr as well as <br>in Uhud. He got a severe wound in Uhud, which did not <br>heal for a long time. He was sent by the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) in an expedition in Safar, 4 A. H. When <br>he returned from the expedition, the old wound again <br>started giving trouble and at last he died of the same on 8th <br>Jamadil-Akhir, 4 A. H. Hadhrat Umme Salamah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) was pregnant at the time. Zainab was born to <br>her after the death of her husband. After she had completed <br>her Iddat (waiting period), Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) proposed to marry her, but she declined. <br>Later, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) offered <br>to marry her. She said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have quite a few children with <br>me and I am very sensitive by nature. Moreover, all my <br>people are in Mecca, and their permission for getting <br>remarried is necessary.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Allah will look after your children and your sensi- <br>tiveness will vanish in due course. None of your <br>people will dislige the proposed marriage\". <br>She then asked her (eldest) son Hadhrat Salamah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) to serve as her guardian and give her in <br>marriage to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was married in the end of Shawwal, 4 A. H. <br>She says: \t \"I had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that a person struck with a calamity <br>should recite this prayer: <br>\"0,Allah! Recompense me for this affliction by giving <br>me something better than what I have lost: then Allah <br>L :\" <br>k \" \t<br>i <br>i <br>i <br>I I <br>i <br>1 \t<br>I \t<br>t \t<br>k5<br>a, oec<br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6. Spirit for Islam <br>8 3<br>would accept his prayer.\" I had been reciting this <br>.=% <br>prayer since the death of Hadhrat Abu Salamah (Rad- <br>z m  <br>hiyallaho anho), but I could not imagine a husband <br>better than he. till Allah arranged my marriage with <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Hadhrat Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: <br>\"Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) was famous for <br>her beauty. Once I contrived to see her. I found her <br>much more beautiful than I had heard. I mentioned <br>this to Hafsah who said. \"In my opinion, she is not as <br>beautiful as people say.\" <br>She was the last of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam's) wives to die. It was in 59 or 62 A. H. She was 84 at <br>the time of her death, and as, such she was born 9 years <br>before Nubuwwat. <br>As has already been said, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) married her after the death of Hadhrat <br>Zainab bint Khuzaimah (Radhiyallaho anha). She therefore <br>lived in Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha's) house. She <br>found a hand-mill, a kettle and some barley in an earthen <br>jar, lying in the house. She milled some barley and after <br>putting some fat cooked a preparation, which she served to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on the very first <br>day of her marriage with him. <br>(7) Hadhrat Zainab bint Jahsh (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) <br>cousin. She was first given in marriage by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) to his adopted son Hadhrat Zaid <br>bin Hari thah (Radhiyallaho anho). When Hadhrat Zaid <br>(~adhi~allaho<br>anho) divorced her, she was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by command of Allah, <br>as mentioned in Soorah A1 Ahzab. This took place in 5 A. <br>H; at that time, she was 35. She w 2s therefore born 17 years<br>before Nabuwat. She was always proud of the fact that, <br>while all the other wives were given in marriage to the <br>Prophet by their guardians, it was Allah Himself Who did <br>this for her. When Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) div- <br>orced her and she had completed her Iddat, the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sent the proposal to her. She <br>said: <br>\"I cannot \t say anything until I have consulted my <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Allah.\" She performed Wudhu, said two rakaat of Salaat, <br>and prayed to Allah: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy Prophet proposes to marry me. If I am <br>fit for the honour, then give me in his marriage.\" <br>Allah answered her prayer by revealing the following verse <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality <br>(of divorce) from her, we gave her unto thee in mar- <br>riage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for be- <br>lievers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, <br>when the latter have performed the necessary formality <br>(of release) from them. The Commandment of Allah <br>must be fulfilled.\" <br>(XXXIII:37) <br>When she received the good news about this revel- <br>ation, she prostrated before Allah in thanksgiving. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) arranged a big feast of <br>Walimah for this marriage. A goat was slaughtered and <br>mutton-curry with bread was served to the guests. People <br>came in groups, and were served till all of them were fed. <br>Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha) had a very large <br>heart for spending in the way of Allah. She earned by <br>working with her hands and spent all her earnings in <br>charity. It was about,her that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prophesied: <br>\"My wife with long hands will be the first to meet me <br>after my death.\" <br>The wives took this to mean the physical length of arms <br>and began to measure their hands with a stick. The hands <br>of Hadhrat Saudah (Radhiyallaho anha) came out to be the <br>longest by measurement. But when Hadhrat Zainab (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) died first, the meaning of the metaphor <br>used by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) dawned <br>upon them. She fasted very often. She died in 20 A. H.and <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) led the funeral service. She was <br>fifty at the time of her death. <br>(8) Hadhrat Juwairiah bintul Harith (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>/ <br>! \t<br><br>Ch. X: Women's Coumge 6 Spirit for Islam <br>4 <br>Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) was the daugh- <br>ter of Harith, the chief of Banu Mustaliq and was married <br>to Musafe' bin Safwan. <br>She was one of the large number of captives who fell <br>into Muslim hands after the battle of Muraisee', and she <br>was given to Hadhrat Thabit bin Qais (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>He offered to release her for 360 Dirhams. She came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am the daughter of Harith who <br>is the chief of the tribe, and you know my story. The <br>ransom demanded by Hadhrat Thabit (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is too much for me. I have come to seek your <br>help in the matter.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to pay her <br>ransom, set her free, and offered to take her as his wife. She <br>was very glad to accept this offer. She was married to the <br>Prophet in 5 A. H. and as a consequence of this marriage, <br>the prisoners of Banu Mustaliq (Juwairiah's tribe), about a <br>hundred families, were all set free by the Muslims. \"The <br>tribe which was so honoured by the Prophet's relation- <br>ship,\" they said, \"should not remain in slavery.\" <br>Such were the noble expediences in all the marriages <br>of the Prophet. Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>very pretty, her face was very attractive. Three days before <br>her falling captive in the battle, she had seen in her dream <br>the moon coming out from Madinah and falling into her <br>lap. She says: <br>\"When I was captured, I began to hope that my dream <br>would come true.\" <br>She was 20 at the time of her marriage with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She died in Rabi-ul-Awwal, <br>50 A. H., in Madinah at the age of 65. <br>, <br>(9) Hadhrat Umme Habibah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Abu Sufyan, and was first <br>married to Ubaidullah bin Jahsh in Mecca. The couple em- <br>braced Islam, and then emigrated to Abyssinia due to per- <br>secution by the Qureysh. One night she saw her husband <br>(in a dream) in the most ugly and obnoxious form. The next <br>day she came to know that he had turned Christian. She, <br>however, remained a Muslim and was therefore separated <br>from him. She was now all alone in exile. But Allah soon <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>recomperised her loss. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) sent her an offer of marriage through the King <br>Negus, who sent a woman named Abrahah to her with the <br>message. She was so happy with the good news that she <br>made over the bracelets and other jewellery that she was <br>wearing to the woman in gratification. King Negrls rep- <br>resented the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in the <br>Nikah ceremony, and gave her 400 dinars as her portion <br>and many other things in dowry from himself. He also gave <br>a feast and dinars as gift to all those who were present in <br>the ceremony. The Negus then despatched her to Madinah <br>with her dowry and other gifts such as perfume, etc. This <br>marriage took place in 7 A. H. (Her father was not a Muslim <br>then). She most probably died in 44 A. H. <br>(10) Hadhrat Safiyyah (Kadhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Hayi, who was a descendant <br>of Hadhrat Harun (Alaihis salaam) the brother of Hadhrat <br>Moosa (Alaihis salaam). She was first married to Salam bin <br>Mishkam and then to Kinanah bin Abi Huqaiq at the time <br>of Kheybar. Kinanah was killed in the battle and she was <br>captured by the Muslims. Hadhrat Dahya Kalbi (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) requested for a maid, and the Prophet made her <br>over to him. At this, the other Sahabah approached the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! Banu Nazir and Banu Quraizah <br>(the Jewish tribes of Madinah) will feel offended to see <br>the daughter of a Jewish chief working as a maid. We <br>therefore suggest that she may be taken as your own <br>wife.\" <br>I <br>The Prophet paid a reasonable sum of money to Hadhrat <br>Dahya (Radhiyallaho anho) as ransom, and said to Sa-<br>fiyyah: <br>\"You are now free: if you like you can go back to your <br>tribe or can be my wife.\" <br>She said: \t \"I longed to be with you while I was a Jew. How <br>can I leave you now, when I am a Muslim?\" <br>This is probably a reference to the fact that she once saw in <br>-her dream a portion of the moon falling into her lap. When <br>she mentioned her dream to Kinanah, he smote her face. so <br>severely that she developed a mark on her eye. He said: <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6.Spirit for Islam <br>\"You seem to be desiring to become the wife of the <br>King of Madinah.\" <br>Her father is also reported to have treated her similarly <br>when she related the same or similar dream to him. She <br>again saw (in her dream) the sun lying on her breast. When <br>she mentioned this to her husband, he remarked: <br>\"You seem to be wishing to become the Queen of Mad- <br>inah.\" <br>She says: \t \"I was seventeen when I was married to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>She came to live with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) when he was camping at the first stage from <br>Khaiber. Next morning, he said to the Sahabah: <br>\"Let everybody bring whatever he has got to eat.'' <br>They brought their own dates, cheese, butter, etc. A long <br>leather sheet was spread and all sat round it to share the <br>food among themselves. This was the Walimah for the mar- <br>riage. <br>She died in Ramadhan, 50 A. H., when she was about <br>60. <br>(II )  Hadhrat Maimoonah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the daughter of Harith bin Hazan. Her original <br>name was Barrah, but she was later renamed Maimoonah <br>by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She was first <br>married to Abu Rahm bin Abdul Uzza. According to some <br>reports, she was married twice before she became Ummul <br>Mominin. She had been widowed lately when the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) married her at Saraf, a place <br>lying on his journey to Mecca for 'Umrah in Zul Qa'dah 7 <br>A. H. He had intended to start living with her when in <br>Mecca after performing 'Umrah but, as Qureysh did not <br>allow him to enter Mecca, he called her over to him in the <br>same place on his return journey. Many years later she died <br>and was buried exactly at the same place in 51 A. H. (when <br>she was 81). This is a strange coincidence that at a certain <br>place during one journey she is married, at the same place <br>on the return journey she starts living with the Prophet. <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and at the very place during <br>another journey she dies and is buried. <br>Hadhrat Aishah (RAdhiyallaho anha) savs: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"Maimoonah was the most pious, and the most mind- <br>ful of her kith and kin, among the Prophet's wives.\" <br>Hadhrat Yazid bin Asam (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"She was seen either engaged in Salat or in domestic <br>work. When she was doing neither, she was busy in <br>Miswak.\" <br>She was the last woman to be married by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Certain Muhaddithin have, how- <br>ever, mentioned one or two other marriages contracted by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Appendix: <br>The Sons of The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had three <br>sons and four daughters. All the children were born from <br>Hadhrat Khadija (Radhivallaho anha), except the son Ibra- <br>him. Qasim was his first son, born to him before Nubuw- <br>wat. He died when he was two. Abdullah, the second son, <br>was born after Nubuwwat. He was, hence, called Tayyab <br>and Taahir. He also died in his childhood. At the time of <br>his death, the Qureysh rejoiced and said: <br>\"Muhammad is without a son, and will therefore be <br>without posterity. His name will also die out with his <br>death.\" <br>It was on this occasion that Soorah Al-Kauthar was re-<br>vealed by Allah. It said: <br>\"Lo! We have given thee Abundance. So pray unto thy <br>Lord, and sacrifice. Lo! it is thy detractor (not thou) <br>(XVIII:1to 3)<br>who is without posterity.\" <br>Even after more than thirteen hundred years, tci :v there <br>are millions who are proud to be connected to him in love <br>and devotion. <br>Ibrahim, the third son and last child, was born in Mad- <br>inah in 8 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam's) <br>wonla11 slave Mariah begot this for him. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) performed the Aqiqah ceremorly <br><br>Ch. X: Women's C o u ~ g e  <br>b Spirit for Islam <br>on the seventh day of his birth. Two lambs were slaugh- <br>tered, the child's head was shaved by Hadhrat Abu Hind <br>Bayazi (Radhiyallaho anho), silver equal in weight to his <br>hair was spent in charity, and the hair was buried. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"I am naming my child after the name of my forefather <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam).\" <br>This son also died, on 10th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, 10 A. Ii., <br>when he was only 18 months old. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) then remarked: <br>\"Allah has appointed a heavenly nurse to tend to Ibra- <br>hirn in the gardens of Paradise.\" <br>The Daughters of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>(1)Hadhrat Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was the eldest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and was born in the fifth year of his first <br>marriage, when he was thirty. She embraced Islam and was <br>married to her cousin Abul Aas bin Rabi. The story of her <br>emigration to Madinah and her getting wounded by the Qu- <br>reysh has already been given in the early part of this chap- <br>ter. She suffered long from that wound, and at last died of <br>it in the beginning of 8 A. H. Her husband also embraced <br>Islam later and joined her in Madinah. She had a son Ali <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). and a daughter Amamah. Ali died <br>during the life time of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). This same Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) was the person <br>who sat with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on <br>the camel's back at the time of his triumphal entry into <br>Mecca. We read frequently in Hadith about a little girl <br>riding on the back of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) as he prostrated in Salaat; this was Amamah, Zainab's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) daughter. She lived long after the <br>death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) married her on the death of Fatima (Rad- <br>hivallaho anha)-his first wife. It is said that Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) at the time of her death had expressed <br>a desire for this union. She had no issue from Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho). After Hadhrat Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>death she was again married to Hadhrat Mughirah bin <br>Naufal (Radhiyallaho anho), from whom she probably got <br>one son named Yahya. She died in 50 A. H. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(2)Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She was born three years after the birth of Hadhrat <br>Zainab (Radhiyallaho anha), when the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was 33. She was married to Utbah, son of <br>Abu Lahab, the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>uncle, but had not yet started living with him when Soorah <br>Al-Lahab was revealed. Abu Lahab called his sons Utbah <br>and Utaibah (to whom Umme Kulsum, another daughter of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam) was married), <br>and said to them: <br>\"Unless you both divorce the daughters of Muham-<br>mad, I am not going to see your faces.\" <br>They divorced their wives. Later, upon the fall of Mecca, <br>Utbah embraced Islam. Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) after this divorce was married to Hadhrat 'Usman <br>(Radhivallaho anho). The couple emigrated to Abyssinia <br>twice. as we have already seen in chapter I. <br>Since the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had an- <br>nounced to the Sahabah that he was expecting to receive <br>Allah's command for emigration to Madinah any time, they <br>started shifting to Madinah even before the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallahoalaihe wassallam) Hijrat. Hadhrat Usman (Radhiyal- <br>Laho anho) and Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho anha) had <br>also emigrated to Madinah before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) arrived in the town. At the time of Badr, <br>Ruqa!lvah was ill (she died subsequently of this illness). <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was, therefore, asked by the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to stay in Madinah <br>and look after her. The news about the victory in Badr was <br>received in Madinah when people were returning from Ru- <br>qayyah's funeral. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was, therefore, not present at her burial. <br>A son was born to Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) in Abvssinia. He was named Abdullah and survived <br>his mother. but died in 4 A. H. when he was six years old. <br>(3)Hadhrat U~nme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>She is the third daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). She was married to Utaibah son of Abu <br>Lahab, but had not yet started living with him when Utai- <br>bah divorced her after the revelation of Soorah Al-Lahab, as <br>has already been mentioned. After divorcing her, Utaibah <br><br>Ch. X:Women's Courage 6.Spirit for Islam <br>213 g4 <br>$.p <br>came to the Prophet (~allall'aho alaihe wasallam) and used <br>most insolent words to him. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe $4 <br>g m<br>wasallam) cursed him by praying: <br>\"0, Allah! depute one of Thy dogs to punish him.\" <br>Abu Talib, who had also not embraced Islam, was alarmed <br>at the curse and said to Utaibah: <br>\"YOU have no way out now.\" <br>Once Utaibah was accompanying Abu Lahab in a caravan <br>going to Syria. Abu Lahab; in spite of his disbelief, said to <br>the people: <br>\"I am afraid of Muhammad's curse. Everybody should <br>be very careful of my son.\" <br>They happened to camp at a place which was inhabited by <br>lions. The people piled up all their luggage and Utaibah <br>was made to sleep on top of the pile, while the rest of the <br>people slept around the pile. A lion came at night; it smelt <br>all the people sleeping round the pile. Then it jumped over <br>the people and reached Utaibah. He gave out a shriek, but <br>meanwhile the lion had severed his head from his body. It <br>is very necessary that we avoid, offending the eople dear <br>to Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal am) has re- <br>P <br>ported Allah as saying: <br>\"I give a challenge of war to one who offends My <br>friends.\" <br>After the death of Hadhrat Ruqayyah (Radhiallaho <br>anha), Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>also married to Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>Rabi-ul-Awwal, 3 A. H. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said: <br>\"I have given Umme Kulsum in marriage to Usman by <br>Allah's command.\" <br>She died issueless in Shaaban, 9 A. H. After herdeath, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have re- <br>marked: <br>\"Even if I had one hundred daughters, I would have <br>given all of them in marriage to 'Usman (one after the <br>other), if each one had died.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>(4)Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha): <br>Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) the fourth and <br>the youngest daughter of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), and the \"head of the ladies in Paradise\" was born <br>in the 1st year of Nubuwwat, when he was 41. It is said <br>that the name Fatimah (lit: safe from fire) was revealed by <br>Allah. She was married to Ali (Radhiyallaho,anho) in 2 A. <br>H. and she began to live with him seven and a half months <br>later. She was about fifteen and Ali was 21 at the time of <br>their union. Of all the daughters, she was the most loved by <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam); whenever he <br>went out on a journey, she was the last one to part with <br>and when he returned home she was the first one to meet <br>him. When Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) intended to marry Abu <br>Jahal's daughter, she was very much grieved and expressed <br>her grief to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho): <br>\"Fatimah is a part of my body. Whoever grieves her, <br>grieves me. \" <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) gave up the idea of the second <br>marriage during her life time. After her death, he married <br>her niece Amamah (Radhiyallaho anha), as we have <br>already seen in the previous pages. <br>It was about six months after the death of the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that Fatimah fell ill. One day, <br>she said to her maid: <br>\"I want to takep bath. Arrange some water for me.\" <br>She took a bath and changed her clothes. She then desired <br>her bed to be placed in the middle of the room. She laid <br>herself down on the bedding, with her face towards Qiblah, <br>and her right hand under her right cheek, and said: <br>\"I am now going to die.\" <br>The next moment she was no more. The Prophet's (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) progeny continued and shall con- <br>tinue (inshallah) through her children. She had three sons <br>and three daughters. Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hus- <br>sain (Radhiyallaho anho) were born in the second and the <br>third year after the marriage, respectively. Muhassan (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the third son, was born in 4 A. H.,.but <br>died in childhood. <br><br>Ch. X: Women's Courage 6.Spirit for lslam <br>Ruqayyah, her first daughter, died in infancy and has, <br>therefore, not been mentioned much in history. Her second <br>daughter Umme Kulsum was first married to Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), begetting one son Zaid and one <br>daughter Hadhrat Ruqayyah. On Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho's) death, Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Radhiyallaho <br>anhaj was married to Aun bin Ja'far, but had no issue from <br>him. After his death, his brother Muhammad bin Ja'far mar- <br>ried her. A daughter was born to them, who died in child- <br>hood Even Muhammad (Radhiyallaho anho) died in her <br>lifetime and she was again married to the third brother, <br>Abdullah bin Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho), from whom she <br>had no issue. She died as Abdullah's wife. Her son Zaid <br>also died the same day, and both were carried for burial at <br>the same time. Abdullah, 'Aun and Muhammad (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum) have already been mentioned as sons of Ja'far <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and nephews of Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in chapter VI. <br>Zainab, Hadhrat Fatima's (Radhiyallaho anha) third <br>daughter, was married to Abdullah bin Ja'far and had two <br>sons Abdullah and Aun from him. It was after her death <br>that he married her sister Hadhrat Umme Kulsum (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>many other children from his wives after Fatimah. It is <br>stated that he had as many as thirty-two issues. Hasan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had fifteen sons and eight daughters, <br>while Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was the father of six <br>sons and three daughters.</p></div>"

The parents and <br>guardians of our times spoil the children by over fondling <br>them. If, instead, they inculcated in their young hearts the <br>importance of Islamic practices, these could easily become <br>their habits when they grow up. When we see a child doing <br>something undesirable, we simply brush it off by saying, <br>'He is but a child.' We have seen some parents even feeling <br>happy over their darling (child) having sufficient grown up <br>to do such unseemly things. We deceive ourselves when <br>we say, on seeing a child doing something un-Islamic, that <br>he will be all right when he grows up. <br>How can a bad seed grow up into a good plant? If you <br>really wish your child to be a good Muslim when he is <br>grown up, you have to sow the seed of Iman and Islam in <br>his heart right from his childhood. The Sahabah were very <br>particular about training their children in Islamic practices. <br>and they kept a watchful eye on their doings. <br>In Hadhrat 'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) time, a person <br>was arrested by the police for drinking in Ramadhan. When <br>he was brought before Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>he said to him: <br>t <br>\"Woe to you! Even our children are keeping fast in this <br>month.\" <br>He was punished with eighty lashes and was banished <br>from Madinah for ever. <br>1. \t Children keep fast. <br>Hadhrat Rubbayi' bint Mu'awwaz (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>(who was mentioned in the last chapter) says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined on us to fast on the 10th of Muharram. Since <br>then we have always been fasting on that day. Even the <br>children were made to fast with us. When they cried <br><br>out in hunger, we diverted them with toys made of <br>cotton flakes till the time of Iftaar.\" <br>We learn from Hadith that the nursing mothers of <br>those days would not feed their infants during the fast. No <br>doubt thev coilld bear all this. as their general health ant1 <br>endurance were dec:idecllv of much higher standard than <br>ours. But. are we really doing even what we can easily <br>bear'! Surely. we should not impose on our children what <br>they cannot stand, but we rllust tax them with what they <br>(:an easilv endure. <br>2. \t Hadhrat Aishah's (Radhiyallaho anha) Zeal for <br>Knowledge. <br>kiadhrat Aishah (Kadhivallaho anha) was given in <br>Nikah when she was six. She started living with the Prophet <br>(Sallallal~oalaihe wasallam) when she was nine. She was <br>only 18 at the time of the Prophet's passing awav. Notwith- <br>standing her age. she is responsible for innunlerable Aha- <br>diths and regulations of <br>Islanlic practices. Masrooq <br>(Kahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"I saw man!^ enlinent Sahnbah coming to Aishah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) for seeking kilowledge about Islamic: <br>jurisprudence.\" <br>'Ata (Kahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"Aishah (Kadhivallaho anha) was more learned than <br>any of the men of her time.\" <br>kladhrat Abu Moosa (lladhivallaho anho) says: <br>\"With the help of Hadhrat Aishah (Kadhiyallaho <br>anha). a solution was found to each and every problem <br>we had to face in the field of religious knowledge.\" <br>The books of Hadith contain as many as 2 210 Ahadith nar- <br>rated I<br>~<br>J Hadhrat Aishah (Kadhivallaho anha). She says: <br>\"I was a child and playing with my playmates in <br>Mecca when the verse. <br>(Nay. but the Ilour is their appointed tryst. and the <br>Hour will be more wretched and more bitter-LIV: 46). <br>was revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\"</p></div>"

She would have been much younger at the rev- <br>elation of this early Meccan verse. This clearly shows her <br>great zeal and devotion for Islamic knowledge right from <br>her childhood. <br>3. \t<br>Hadhrat 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) goes to Battle. <br>Hadhrat Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) was a slave of Abil <br>Lahm (Radhiyallaho anho) and of very tender age. Every soul <br>in those days. irrespective of age, was eager to strive in the <br>Path of Allah, '1Jmair (Kadhiyallaho anho) requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to permit him to fight in <br>the battle of Khaiber. His master also recommended him very <br>strongly. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) permitted <br>him and gave him a sword. which 'Umair (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) hung round his neck. Now the sword was too big for <br>his size. and he had to drag it with him. He fought in the <br>battlettill it ended in victorv. As he was a minor and a slave. <br>he was not entitled to full share in the booty. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). however. allotted him a share as <br>a very special case. <br>Although 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) knew that he <br>was not going to get any share from the spoils of war, vet <br>he was so eager to fight in the battle and sought recommen- <br>dations for it. What could be his motive other than the <br>reward of the Hereafter. as promised by Allah and reported <br>by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>4. \t Hadhrat 'Umair' bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) hides himself. <br>Hadhrat 'Umair bin Abi Waqqaas (Radhivallaho anho) <br>was a Sahabi of tender age, who had embraced Islam in its <br>early days. He was a brother of Hadhrat Sa'd bin Abi Waq- <br>qaas (Radhiyallaho anha) the famous Muslim general. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates: <br>t <br>\" t i t  the time when we were preparing to march for <br>Badr, I noticed 'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) trying <br>somehow to hide himself. This surprised me. I said to <br>k <br>him. 'What has happened to you? What makes you <br>hide like this?'

Hadhrat <br>'Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) could not bear this and began <br>to cry. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>informed of this eagerness and disappointment, he per- <br>mitted him to go. He fought in the battle till he was killed. <br>Hadhrat Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho), Umair's brother, says: <br>\"The sword of Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) was too big <br>for his size. I had to put a number of knots in the belt, <br>so that it might not touch the ground.\" <br>5. \t Two Youngsters of the Ansar Kill Abu Jahl. <br>Hadhrat Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>one of the most eminent Sahabah, narrates: <br>\"In the battle of Badr, I was standing in the fighting <br>line when I noticed two Ansar youngsters, one on <br>either side. I thought it would have been better if I had <br>been between strong men who could then help me in <br>need. Suddenly, one of the boys caught my hand and <br>said, 'Uncle, do you know Abu jahl?' I said, 'Yes, but <br>what do you mean by this?' He said, 'I have come to <br>know that the wretched man reviles the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). By Him who holds my life in <br>His hand, if I see him, I will not leave him until I kill <br>him or I am killed.' His words left me wonderstruck. <br>Then the other boy had a similar talk with me. I hap-<br>pened to notice Abu Jahl dashing about in the battle- <br>field on the back of his horse. I said to the boys, 'There <br>is the object of your quest.'

The boys were on foot, while Abu Jahl was on <br>horse back. One of the boys hit a leg of the horse and the <br>other that of Abu Jahl. This caused both to fall down and <br>Abu Jal~l was unable to get up. The boys left him in this <br>c:onrlition. Mu'awwez bin Afra brother of I-ladhrat Ma'az <br>bin Afra (Radhi~lallaho anho) then went and further dis- <br>abled him with his sword, so that he might not drag him- <br>self <br>to <br>his <br>camp.

But when I found it too cumbersonie. I <br>severed i t  from my body, by placing it ulicler my foot <br>and pulling myself up. and threw it awav.\" <br>6. A Contest Between Rafe' and Samurah. <br>Whenever an army of Mujahidin moved out from Mad- <br>inah for a campaign. the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) inspected them at some distance outside to ensure <br>that nothing was lacking in men and equipment. It was <br>here that he usually returned to Madinah all those tender- <br>aged bovs who had come out with the army in their zeal to <br>fight for Islam. While setting out for Uhud. the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe ~rasallam) carried out this inspection just <br>outside Madinah. He ordered the young boys to go back. <br>Among them were Abdullah bin 'Umar, Zaid bin Thabit. <br>Usamah bin Zaid, Zaid bin Arqam. Bara bin Azib. Amr bin <br>Hazarn. Usaid bin Zubair. 'Urabah bin Aus, Abu Sa'eed <br>Khudri. Samurah bin Jundub and Rafe' bin Khudaij (Rad- <br>hiyallalio anhum). All of them had just entered their teens. <br>Khudaij said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah! My son Rafe' is a very good <br>archer.\" <br>+ <br>Hadhrat Rafe' (Kadhiyallaho anho) too, stood on his toes to <br>show himself taller than lie actually was. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe 1uasa1l;lm) permitted him to stav on. When <br><br>San~urah bill Jundub learnt about this, he cornplailled to <br>his step-father klu~urrah bin Sanan saving: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallarn) has per-<br>mitted Kafe' ancl rejected me. while I am sure to beat <br>him in a wrestling coiltest and, therefore, 1 tvas more <br>cfeservina of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>fa\\Jour.\" <br>This was reported to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lanl). who allowetl Saiilrah to prove his claim bv wrestling <br>with Rafe': Samurah did at:tuallv beat Rafe' in the bout and <br>he too was permitted to stay ill the army. A few more boys <br>made similar efforts to stay on, and some of them did suc- <br>ceecl. Meanwhile it becanle dark. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallanl) made necessary arrangements for the <br>watch and ward of the camp during the night, and then in- <br>quiretl: <br>\"No~v,who is going to guard niy tent during the <br>night?\" <br>A person (standing at his place): <br>\"I. 0 Prophet of Allah!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"What is vour name?\" <br>The person: <br>\"Zakn an.\" <br>The Prophet (Salldllaho alaihe wasallarn): <br>\"All right. You take !lour seat.\" <br>He a-gain inquired: <br>\"Who else is volunteering to guard <br>night'?\" <br>A voice: <br>\"I. 0Prophet of Allah!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Who are vou?\" <br>A voice: <br>\"Abu Saba' (father of Saba').\" <br>my tent for to- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"All right. Sit down.\" <br>He enquired for the third time: <br>\"Who will be the third nian to guard mv tent. tonight'!\" <br>Again came a voice from the crowd: <br>\"I. 0 Prophet of Allah!\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Your name?\" <br>The voice: <br>\"Ibn Abdulqais (son of Abdul Qais).\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"All right. You also sit down.\" <br>Then the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bade all the <br>three volurlteers to colne to him. Only one person came for- <br>ward. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Where are your other two comrades'?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! It was I who stood up all the <br>three times. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) blessed him with <br>his pravers. and allowed him to guard his tent. He kept <br>watching the tent all night long. <br>Just look! How eager the Sahabah were to face death <br>for the sake of Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The children and adults. young and old, men and <br>women. all were intoxicated with the same spirit of sacri- <br>fice and devotion. <br>Rafb bin Khudaij had offered to fight in Badr too, but <br>he was not permitted. 111 Uhud. however, he was allowed <br>to fight for the first time. Since then, he had bee11 partici- <br>pating in almost all the campaigns. In Uhud the enemy's <br>arrow struck him in his chest. When it was drawn but, a <br>small remnant remained inside his bodv. This caused a <br>wound. whic;li eventually proved fatal in his old age. <br><br>0)<br>Ch.

He was eleven at the time of <br>Hijrah.<br>He offered himself for the battle of Badr, but was re- <br>jected on account of his tender age. He again volunteered <br>for Uhud. This time also he was not permitted, as we saw <br>in the last story. He had since then been participating in all <br>the campaigns. While the Mujahidin were marching to- <br>wards Tabuk, the flag of Banu Malik clan was held by Am- <br>marah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bade him <br>make over the flag to Zaid. Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>thought that perhaps somebody had made a complaint <br>against him, which had displeased the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He therefore said: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Is it due to somebody com-<br>plaining against me?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. But Zaid knows more Qur'an than you do. His <br>Qur'an has given him preference.\" <br>It was common with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that he gave preference to the people in accordance <br>with their virtues. Although this was an occasion of battle. <br>and a knowledge of the Qur'an had no direct bearing on the <br>issue, yet the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave <br>preference to Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) for his Qur'an. This <br>distinction we find on other occasions as well. When a <br>number of dead persons had to be accommodated in one <br>grave (as in Uhud), they were buried in the order of their <br>knowledge of the Qur'an, priority being given to those who <br>knew more of it. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri's (Radhiyallaho anhoj Re- <br>straint. <br>Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"I was <br>presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by <br>my father for fighting at Uhud, when I was thirteen. My <br>father recommended me saying: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah! He has a very good body. His <br>bones are very well-developed.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) looked at me <br>again and again, and finally rejected me due to my young <br>age. My father, however, participated in the battle and was <br>killed. He left me nothing to live on. I went to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to seek some financial help <br>from him. Before I could express myself, he addressed me <br>saying: <br>'Abu Saeed! Whoso seeks endurance from Allah! gets <br>it; Whoso seeks chastity from Him, gets it; And whoso <br>seeks contentment from Him will surely get it.' <br>After hearing this, I returned home without making any re- <br>quest to him. On this, Allah blessed him with such an <br>exalted position that, among the younger Sahabah, there is <br>nobody endowed with so much knowledge and learning as <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Look at the restraint of Abu Sa'eed at such a young age. <br>As we know, in Uhud he had lost his father who had left <br>him nothing to live on and therefore he fully deserved all <br>help; yet a few words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) stopped him from talking of his distress and seek- <br>ing a favour. Can a person much older than him show such <br>a strength of character? In fact, the persons selected by <br>Allah for the company of his dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) did really deserve that honour. That is <br>why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"Allah has preferred my conlpanions over all other <br>men.\" <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Salmih bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>faces the Bandits. <br>Ghabah was a small village at four or five miles from <br>Madinah. The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>camels were sent to that place for grazing. Abdur Rahman <br>Fazari, with the help of a few disbelievers, killed the <br>person looking after the camels and took them away. The <br>bandits were riding their horses, and all of them were <br>armed. Salmah bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) was going <br>on foot in the morning with his bow and arrows, when he <br>happened to see the bandits. He was only a boy but he ran <br>very fast. It is said that he could beat the fastest horse in <br>race. He was also a very good archer. No sooner did he see <br>the bandits than he climbed up a hill and shouted towards <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>Madinah to raise an alarm. He then chased the bandits and, <br>on approaching near them, started sending arrows one after <br>the other. He did this so swiftly and incessantly that the <br>bandits thought they were being chased by a large number <br>of people. If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow. The bandits at once retreated at <br>full speed to escape from being captured. Salmah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I kept on chasing the bandits till all the camels taken <br>away by them were behind me. Besides, in their flight <br>they left behind 30 spears and 30 sheets of cloth of <br>their own. Meanwhile, Uyainah bin Hisn (another <br>bandit) and his party arrived on the scene to reinforce <br>the bandits. They had meanwhile come to know that I <br>was all alone. They now chased me in large concentra- <br>tion and I was compelled to climb up a hill. As they <br>were about to approach me I shouted, 'Stop. First <br>listen to me. Do you know who am I? I am Ibnul <br>Akwah. By Him who has given glory to Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), if anyone of you chases <br>me. he cannot catch me. On the other hand, if I run <br>after any of you he cannot escape me.' I kept on talking <br>to them in that strain to beguile them till, I thought. <br>help would reach me from Madinah. I looked anx-<br>iously through the trees, as I talked to them when at <br>last, I noticed a group of riders headed by Akhram <br>Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) coming towards me. As <br>Akhram approached the bandits, he attacked Abdur <br>Rahman and cut one leg of his horse. Abdur Rahman, <br>as he fell down from the horse, attacked Akhram and <br>killed him. Abu Qatadah (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>meanwhile arrived. In the combat that ensued. Abdur <br>Rahman lost his life and Abu Qatadah his horse.\" <br>It is written in some books of history that, when <br>Akhram was going to attack Abdur Rahman, Salmah ad- <br>vised him to wait till the rest of his people had joined him. <br>But he did not wait. saying: <br>\"I wish to die as a martyr in the path of Allah.\" <br>He was the only person killed from among the Muslims. <br>The bandits lost a good number of their men. The11 more <br>reinforcement reached the Muslims, and the bandits took <br>to their heels. Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) sought the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) permission to <br>pursue them saying: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah! Let me have one hundred men, I <br>shall teach them a lesson.\" <br>But the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. They would have by now reached their bases.\" <br>Most of the historians say that Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was hardly 12 or 13 at that time. Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them. This was the outcome of Iman and <br>Ikhlas, with which Allah had imbued the hearts of those <br>blessed people. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Bara's (Radhiyallaho anho) eagerness to Join <br>in Badr. <br>Badr was the most gallant and illustrious battle ever <br>fought by the Muslims, who were faced with very heavy <br>odds. There were 313 men, 3 horses, seventy camels, six or <br>nine coats of arms and eight swords with the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), while the Qureysh had about <br>1000 men, 100 horses, 700 camels, and were armed to their <br>teeth. The Qureysh were so sure of their victory that they <br>had brought with them musical instruments and song-<br>stresses to celebrate the victory. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was very anxious because of the heavy <br>odds against him. Heprayed to Allah saying: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy faithful slaves are barefooted; Thou and <br>only Thou can provide them with animals to ride <br>upon. They are naked; Thou and only Thou can clothe <br>them. They are poor; Thou and only Thou can sustain <br>them.\" <br>Allah granted his prayer and gave the most glorious victory <br>to the Muslims. <br>In spite of knowing the strength of the Qureysh, Ab- <br>dullah bin 'Umar and Bara bin Azib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), in eagerness to join the battle, had come out with <br>the Mujahidin. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>however, in consideration of their tender age, did not <br>permit them to proceed to the battle-field. <br><br>As we have already seen, both these boys were also re- <br>jected for the same reason at the time of Uhud, which took <br>place one year after Badr. Look at the wonderful spirit of <br>the youngsters of that time that they were anxious to obtain <br>permission for participating in every battle. <br>11. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus: <br>\"All this is the outcome of the seed that you people <br>have sown with your own hands. You provided refuge <br>to these strangers (meaning Muhajirin) in your town <br>and shared your wealth equally with them. If you <br>withdraw your help from them, they will be obliged to <br>go back.\" <br>He further said: <br>\"By Allah! On return to Madinah, we, the respected <br>people, shall drive out these mean people from there.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho), an Ansari <br>boy was listening to him. He could not tolerate these words <br>and at once retorted by saying to him: <br>\"By Allah! You yourself are wretched. Even your own <br>people look down upon you, and nobody will support <br>you. Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>honoured. He is exalted by Rahman and revered by his <br>followers.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ubayy said: <br>\"All right. Do not mention it to anybody. It was only a <br>jest; I was not serious in w h t  I said.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>statement and took no action against him. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know that the Munafiq had suc- <br>ceeded in , beguiling the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through false oaths, he would not come out for <br>shame of being considered a liar by the people. He would <br>not even go to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At <br>last, Allah revealed Soorah A1 Munafiqoon, in which the <br>report of Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was confirmed and the <br>Munafiq was exposed. After this, all people began to <br>honour Zaid and look down upon the Munafiq. <br>Now the Munafiq (Abdullah bin Ubayy) had a son. His <br>name was also Abdullah and he was a very sincere <br>Muslim. When the Mujahidin were about to reach Madi- <br>nah, he drew out his sword and stood just outside the town <br>and, in a challenging tone, said to his Munafiq father: <br>\"I will not allow you to enter Madinah, until you <br>admit with your own tongue that it is you who is mean <br>and Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>exalted.\" <br>This surprised him very much, as the son had always been <br>very respectful to kim, but now he was prepared to kill <br>him, his own father, for the honour of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). The Munafiq had to declare: <br><br>0)<br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>229 3% <br>L.0 4 <br>\"By Allah! I am mean, and Muhammad (Sallallaho 8 g  <br>alaihe wasallam) is most exalted.\" <br>2;<br>G <br>He was then allowed to enter the town. <br>12. Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) Eagerness to <br>Fight. <br>When the battle of Uhud was over, the remnant of Sa- <br>habah returned to Madinah, most tired and broken. When <br>the Qureysh, on their way back to Mecca, were camping at <br>a place called Hamra-ul Asad, their chief, Abu Sufyan, sat <br>in council with his lieutenants. They said among them- <br>selves: <br>\"The Muslims are defeated in Uhud. Their morale <br>must be very low. This is the best time to finish Mu- <br>hammad.\" <br>They, therefore, decided to return and attack Madinah. <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) received in- <br>telligence about this council, he ordered all those Sahabah <br>who had participated in Uhud, and who had just returned <br>from the battle, to move out of Madinah and meet the <br>enemy on the way. <br>Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I was very eager to fight in Uhud, <br>but my father prevented me from going, on the plea <br>that there was no other member in the house to look <br>after my seven sisters and only one of us could join the <br>campaign. As he had made up his mind to go, he bade <br>me stay back with the family. He met the most coveted <br>end [i.e., martyrdom) in Uhud. Now I am very eager to <br>go with you this time and fight the Qureysh.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) allowed him to <br>go. He was the only person in that campaign who had not <br>fought in Uhud. <br>Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) father was mar-<br>tyred in Uhud. He left Jabir a big family to look after and <br>large debts to clear, with nothing to live on. The debts were <br>due to one of the Jews, who as we know seldom have any <br>soft corner in their hearts for their debtors. Also his seven <br>sisters for whose sake he was not allowed to go to Uhud- <br>were still there to be boked after. Now look! inspite of all <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage, 100 000 dinars in prize, and also <br>governorship over the area now ruled by him.\" <br>The fighi was very tough and went on for a long time. <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) succeeded in spotting <br>Jarjir seated behind his forces, under an umbrella of <br>peacock feathers held by two maids. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), all at once, outskirted the Roman <br>troops and approached him. He attacked Jarjir with his <br>sword and severed his head from his body. He then <br>fixed the head oh the point of his spear and returned to <br>his camp, to the utter amazement of both the armies at <br>his matchless valour. <br>When the Sahabah emigrated to Madinah, no son was <br>borne to any of the emigrants for one year after the emigra- <br>tion. The Jews of Madinah said: <br>\"We have cast a spell on the emigrants. They cannot <br>have male issue.\" <br>Abdullah 'bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was the first <br>male child born to the Muhajirin. The Muslims were, natu- <br>rally, very happy over his birth. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not generally allow the children to <br>take oath of allegiance to him. But Abdullah bin Zubair <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>231 gz <br>Gm;g<br>a <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had the honour of pledging allegiance .=+<br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) when he was <br>g m<br>* <br>only seven. During this battle, he was barely in his early <br>twenties. To go single-handed and kill the commander, <br>after hoodwinking his army of 200 000 men, at this age is <br>really marvellous. <br>14. \t Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) Leads <br>in Salaat. <br>Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We lived with our father at a place on the caravan <br>route to Madinah. When a caravan from Madinah <br>passed our village, we asked the people therein about <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They would <br>tell us that he claimed to be receiving revelations from <br>Allah, and they would also recite a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before us to give us an idea about his claim. <br>Then I immediately used to commit those verses to <br>memory. In this way, I remembered a good portion of <br>the Qur'an, even before I embraced Islam. All the <br>desert tribes were waiting for Mecca to fall to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) before they em- <br>braced Islam. On his victorious entry into Mecca, <br>deputations from all the tribes began to come to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in order to accept <br>Islam. My father headed the group who went to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pledge alle- <br>giance to him on behalf of our tribe. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) taught them the basic <br>regulations about Salaat and other Islamic practices. <br>He said to them, \"The person who knows more Qur'an <br>is entitled to lead in Salaat. Now it so happened that <br>none in my tribe knew so much Qur'an as I did. They <br>searched for an Imam, but they could not find a person <br>knowing more Qur'an than me. I was, therefore, made <br>Imam. At that time, I was only seven. I led the congre; <br>gational Salaat and funeral service if any.\" <br>It was his natural inclination and affinity towards Islam <br>that made him remember so much of the Qur'an when he <br>was only a boy and he had not even embraced Islam. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) used <br>to say to the people: <br>\"Come to me for your difficulties in understanding the <br>Qur'an. I memorised it while I was only a child.\" <br>In another Hadith, he is reported to have said: <br>\"I had completed my reading of the Qur'an when I'was <br>only ten.\" <br>r <br>The reading of the Qur'an by Sahabah was not done <br>like the reading by the non-Arabs of today. Whatever they <br>read, they read with full meaning and explanation. As the <br>impression of something memorised in childhood is very <br>deep and permanent, so Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is accepted as Imam in Tafsir. None of the Sahabah <br>has narrated more Ahadith explaining the meaning of <br>Qur'an than was done by Ibn Abbas. Abdullah bin Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is the best <br>commentator of the Qur'an.\" <br>Abu Abdur Rahman (Rahmatullah alaih), on the authority <br>of Sahabah who taught him the Qur'an, says: <br><br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was saying his Salaat. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>joined him in Salaat by standing behind him. The Prophet <br>caught him by the hand and drew him to his side. (When <br>there is only one follower in Salaat with Jamaat, he stands <br>by the side of Imam and not after him). While the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was busy in Salaat, he moved <br>back a little distance. When the Salaat was over, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him: <br>\"What made you recede from your place?\" <br>Hesaid: \t \"You are the Prophet of Allah!. How could I <br>stand with you.\" <br>On this occasion too, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) prayed for his knowledge and understanding. <br>17. \t ~ b d u l l a hbin Amr bin Aas Notes Down Ahadith: <br>Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>one of the most pious Sahabah. Daily he used to fast during <br>the day, and finish one Qur'an during the night. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) restrained him from <br>this excessive devotion and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger <br>or humour are actually not meant by him. You should <br>not write each and every thing spoken by him.' I ac- <br>cepted the advice. On my once mentioning this to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he said, 'You <br>keep doing as before. By Him who holds my life in His <br>hand, my lips do not utter anything except the truth, <br>even in anger or joy.\" <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"No one has narrated about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) more than me, except Abdullah bin <br>Amr. This is because he used to note down what he <br>heard, while I relied on my memory.\" <br>This is really wonderful, especially when we know that <br>most of his time was reading the Qur'an and other acts of <br>piety. <br>18. Zaid bin Thabit Memorises the Qur'an. <br>Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of those <br>eminent Sahabah who are considered to be most learned <br>and whose words in religious matters carry much weight. <br>He was an expert in regulations regarding obligatory prac- <br>tices. It is said that he was among the top ranking jurists, <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading. I desire you to learn the Jewish lan- <br>guage.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"In fifteen days, I mastered Hebrew and after that I <br>started doing all such correspondence for him.\" <br>According to another Hadith, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is reported to have similarly mastered the Syriac language <br>at the instance of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>He managed this within the short period of 17 days only. <br>19. Hasan's Knowledge of Islam. <br>The head of Sayyids, Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>born in Ramadhan, 3 A. H. He was thus a little over seven <br>years old at the time of the Prophet's death. In spite of his <br>tender age, quite a few Ahadith have been narrated by him. <br>Abul Howraa once asked him: <br>\"Do you remember any saying of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Yes. Once I was going with him. On the way I saw a <br>large quantity of dates of Sadaqah piled up at one <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah! Guide me along with those whom Thou <br>hast guided. Keep me in ease along with those whom <br>Thou hast kept in ease. Be my protecting friend along <br>with those whose protecting friend Thou has been. <br>Bless me in what Thou hast granted me. Grant me pro- <br>tection against the ill-effects of what may have been or- <br>dained for me, for Thy decision is final and nobody <br>can decide against Thy will. He who has Thee as the <br>protecting Friend cannot be abased. 0,Our Lord! Thou <br>art blessed and Thou art the Highest.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>\"The person who keeps sitting till sunrise at the place <br>where he said his Fajr prayers shall be saved from the <br>Hell.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) performed his Hajj many times <br>by covering the distance from Madinah to Mecca on foot <br>and, when asked about his reasons for undergoing such <br>hardships. he remarked: <br>\"I feel ashamed to face Allah (after my death) without <br>having gone to Mecca on foot for pilgrimage tp his <br>House.\" <br>Hasan is reputed for his piety and mildness. He is respon- <br>sible for narrating many Ahadith, collected by Imaam <br><br>Ahmad in his Musnad. The author of 'Talqih' has included <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) among those who have reported <br>as many as 13 Ahadith. To have remembered so many Aha- <br>dith at the age of 7 shows his devotion to Islam and his re- <br>markable memory. On the other hand, our children at this <br>age generally do not know even the elements of Islam. <br>20. \t Husain's Zeal for Knowledge. <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was one year junior to <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anha), his brother. He was a little over <br>6 at the time of the Prophet's death. Nothing much can be <br>expected from a child of this age, but there are quite a few <br>Ahadith narrated by Husain (Radhiyallaho anho). Muhad- <br>dithin count him among those Sahabah who are respon- <br>sible for giving us at least 8 Ahadith. <br>The following Ahadith are among those narrated by <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>1. \t \"Each time a person recites 'Inna-lillahi-wa-inna- <br>Ilaihi-raaji-oon' when he recalls or is otherwise re- <br>minded of an adversity previously met by him, he <br>receives a reward from Allah as good as he would <br>have had at the time of actual infliction.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"A Muslim gets immunity from drowning while <br>crossing a river if, at the time of embarking, he re- <br>cites: \". O <br>* 0 ! ;  <br>0 , .  <br>( t r \t y)wj jpJJJ d! kL>j G$+ <br>& <br>(In the name of Allah be its course and its moor- <br>ing. Lo! My Lord is, surely, most Forgiving, most <br>Merciful).\" <br>3. \t \"To shun vain things makes one a good Muslim.\" <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once asked Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) if he re-<br>membered any incident in the life of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'Yes. Once <br>managed to get on to a few dates lying near a window <br>and put one of them into my mouth. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) bade me take out and throw <br>away the date, as we (i.e. his family members) were not <br>permitted to eat anything from Sadaqah.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) had gone on foot 25 times <br>for pilgrimage to Mecca. He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here- <br>after. In childhood the memory is at its best. Anything <br>memorised at that time is seldom forgotten. If children are <br>made to memorise the Qur'an, they will be able to do so <br>very easily and quickly. I have heard very frequently from <br>the elderly ladies of my family and from my respected <br>father himself that he had memorised one fourth of the <br>thirtieth part of the Qur'an even before he was weaned, and <br>he had finished memorising the whole Qur'an and, on the <br>top of that, he had read a few standard books in Persian lit- <br>erature (the latter 6f his own accord) while he was only <br>seven. He once narrated to me: <br>\"When I had finished memorising the Qur'an, my <br>father required me to repeat (from memory) the full <br>Qur'an once daily, and permitted me to play for the <br>rest of the day. I used to sit on the roof of the house <br>(being summer) and start reciting the Qur'an just after <br>Fajr. I would finish the whole of it in about seven <br>hours. I then had my lunch. In the evening, I used to <br>have lessons in Persian, though it was not compulsory <br>for me. To this routine I stuck for full six months.\" <br>It is not an ordinary thing for a child of seven to recite <br>the Qur'an once daily for full six months, along with learn- <br><br>ing other things. As a result, he would never forget or <br>commit an error when reciting the Qur'an from memory. <br>Apparently, he earned his livelihood by trade in books. He <br>was found reciting the Qur'an with his lips, even when his <br>hands were engaged in his job. Sometimes he would even <br>teach the boys (who wanted to learn from him after the <br>school hours), while himself reciting the Qur'an and doing <br>his job. He thus attended to three things at a time. But his <br>way of teaching his students was different from that <br>adopted currently in the schools, where the entire burden <br>is on the teachers. He simply listened to the student <br>reading, translating and explaining the meaning. If the stu- <br>dent was correct, he simply said, \"'Go ahead,\" but if the <br>student made some error or needed some further explana- <br>tion, then he only would correct or explain as the gase <br>might be. Now, this story is not of ancient times; this has <br>happened only recently. It is therefore wrong to presume <br>jhat the Muslims of today, being of poor physical strength, <br>cannot try to follow the footsteps of their ancestors in <br>Islam. <br><br>CHAPTER XI1 <br>LOVE FOR THE PROPHET <br>What we have hitherto read about the achievement of <br>the Sahabah in their time was in fact the result of their love <br>for Allah and for His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Love, as a matter of fact, was a great dynamic force in the <br>Sahabah's career. It was this force that made them forego <br>their luxuries, forget their lives, give up all their desires for <br>wealth, ignore all afflictions, and have no fear of death <br>even. There is no room for any other consideration (except <br>that of beloved) in the heart saturated with love. May Allah <br>through His Grace grant us His own love and that of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), so that we may be <br>blessed with devotion in His worship and have sense of <br>comfort in all difficulties faced in His service. <br>1. Abu Bakr's [Radhiyallaho anho) Sufferings for Islam. <br>In the beginning, those who embraced Islam had to <br>keep their faith secret, as far as possible. As the Muslims <br>were being constantly persecuted by the Qureysh, even the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised all new con- <br>verts to practise Islam secretly, so that they might not have <br>to suffer at the hands of Qureysh. When, however, the <br>number of Muslims reached 39, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) made a suggestion for the open preaching and prac- <br>tising of Islam. ThepProphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>would not agree, but, when Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>insisted. he gave his consent and so all of them went to <br>Haram for Tabligh. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) began to <br>speak, and the Khutbah given by him was the first ever de- <br>livered in the annals of Islam. Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>i <br>the Prophet's uncle and the Chief of Martyrs embraced <br>k <br>Islam on that very day, while 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came into the Muslim fold on the third day of this address. <br>No sooner did Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) start speaking <br>I<br>than the idolaters and disbelievers from amongst the Qu- <br>reysh fell upon the Muslims from all sides. Despite the fact <br>that he was considered to be the noblest and most respect- <br>able of all the people in Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was beaten to such an extent that his nose and ears <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>241 4c <br>$2<br>and his entire face were besmeared with blood. He was <br>kicked. thrashed with shoes, trampled under feet and han- <br>8 1  <br>dled most roughly and savagely. He became unconscious <br>vlI g  <br>and half-dead; none hoped that he would ever survive this <br>brutal onslaught. Banu Teem, the people of his clan, came <br>and carried him to his house. They also announced in the <br>Haram that if Abu Bakr succumbed to the injuries, they <br>would in retaliation take the life of Utbah bin Rabee'ah, <br>who had taken the most active part in the attack. Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) remained unconscious the whole day. <br>People round him shouted his name again and again to <br>know if he was in senses, but he would not speak. Late in <br>the evening however he opened his eyes and showed signs <br>of consciousness. As soon as he was able to speak, he en- <br>quired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>The people were most disappointed with him and they <br>said: <br>\"How is it that, despite all this calamity and after vir- <br>tually remaining in the jaws of death all day long on <br>account of the Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as <br>soon as he has come back to consciousness he has <br>nothing else to talk about, but the Prophet himself.\" <br>They left Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), much disgusted at <br>his devotion for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while they were satisfied that he was out of danger. They <br>advised Umme Khair, his mother, to give him something to <br>eat. But least minding his food, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) would incessantly and impatiently ask his mother <br>the same question again and again i.e. <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>On her showing ignorance about the welfare of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), Abu Bakr entreated <br>her to go to Umme Jamil (Umar's sister) and find out from <br>her the latest news about the Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The mother could not refuse the request of her son <br>in this pitiable condition, and hurried to Umme Jamil's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) house to enquire about the welfare of <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Like,other Mus- <br>lims of that time, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallah anha) was also <br>keeping her faith secret. She therefore concealed her <br>Stories of the Scrhaabah <br>knowledge about the Prophet (SallalIaho alaihe wasallam), <br>saying: <br>\"Who is Muhammad and who is Abu Bakr? Why <br>should I know anything about them? I am however <br>sorry to learn about the condition of your son; if you <br>like, I can go with you to see him.\" <br>Umme Khair agreed and they both came to Abu Bakr. On <br>seeing Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in that miserable con- <br>dition, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) could not control <br>herself and began to cry, saying: <br>\"Woe to the ruffians for what they have done to a man <br>like Abu Bakr. May Allah punish them for their mis- <br>conduct.\" <br>Regardless of what Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) said, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had the same words on his <br>lips viz: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil (pointing towards Umme Khair): <br>\"Is it safe to say anything in her presence?\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"Do not worry about her. Tell me quickly <br>i <br>how is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil: \"He is quite well.\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: <br>\"Where is he at this moment.\" <br>Umme Jamil: \t \"Heis at Arqam's place.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"By Allah! I will not eat anything until I <br>have looked at him.\" <br>Now, his mother was very anxious to feed him. She <br>knew that when he had sworn by Allah he would not break <br>his oath and, therefore, would not eat under any circum- <br>stances. She therefore agreed to take him to Arqam's place. <br>She had to wait till the street was least-frequented by the <br>people and she was able to take him to that place unde- <br>tected by Qureysh. When they both reached Arqam's place, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and clung to him weeping profusely. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reciprocated, and all <br>the Muslims who were present there also began to weep <br><br>bitterly over the condition of Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) then iptroduced his <br>mother Umme Khair to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), saying: <br>\"She is my mother, 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for her <br>and induce her to accept Islam.\" <br>The prophet first prayed for her and then preached to her. <br>She accepted Islam there and then. <br>Many people can claim to be lovers while in ease and <br>comfort. But a lover is a real lover when he is able to prove <br>his love even in the tribulation and adversity. <br>2. \t<br>'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Grief at the Prophet's <br>Death. <br>None can deny the proverbial valour, courage and <br>strength of 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), over whose men- <br>tion, even after the lapse of 1400 years, hearts are struck <br>with awe and respect. Islam could not be professed and <br>preached openly before 'Umar's coming into its fold. As <br>soon as he embraced Islam, the Muslims started saying <br>Salaat in the Haram, as none could dare harm them with <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their side. Notwithstanding <br>all this, he could not bear the shock of the Prophet passing <br>away. So much so that he stood with sword in his hand, ut- <br>terly confused and bewildered, saying: <br>\"I shall behead the person who says that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has passed away. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has only gone to <br>visit his Lord, just as Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone <br>to Toor. He will shortly return and cut off the hands <br>and feet of those who were spreading the false news of <br>his death.\" <br>On the other hand, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>stunned with grief on this event. He could not utter a single <br>word, even till the next day, and walked about as if bereft <br>of speech. Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), too, was in terrible <br>grief. He was still and motionless. Only Abu Bakr, (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) for all his love of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as we have seen in the last story, stood <br>firm as a rock against this terrible storm of grief and did not <br>lose his mental composure. He calmly entered the Proph- <br>et's house, kissed his forehead and came back to the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>As Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was destined to be <br>the Khalifah after the Prophet, (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) <br>E<br>it is significa~t that, unlike other Sahabah, he behaved with <br>the composure and patience that were needed on an oc- <br>casion like this. Again. it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) alone who knew better than anybody else about the <br>regulations regarding the burial, inheritance, etc, of the <br>Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam). When difference of <br>opinion arose among the Sahabah whether the burial place <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) be at Mecca or <br>Madinah or jerusalenl, it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) who settled the difference by saying on the authority <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the Proph- <br>ets are buried where they have died. There were several <br>other Ahadith known only to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that helped solve many of the other problems arising <br>/<br>out of the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>t <br>lam). Some of these Ahadith were: \t<br>i <br>(1) \"Prophets have no heirs. All that a Prophet leaves <br>behind is Sadaqah.\" <br>i<br>(2) \t\"Allah's curse is on the Amir who does not take <br>proper interest and excercise proper care in the ap- <br>pointment of his deputies.\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was told that he was safe and sound, but she would not rest <br>contented, and insisted on seeing him herself. When at last <br>she had satisfied her eyes with his sight, she said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, every affliction is eased and every <br>worry removed with the blessing of seeing you.\" <br>According to another version, she herself clung to the <br>Prophet's robes and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to me than my par- <br>ents. The death of my kinsmen has lost all its sting for <br>me when I have seen you living.\" <br>There are several incidents of this kind that occurred <br>after the battle of Uhud. It is, perhaps, for the large number <br>of such incidents that different names have been reported <br>by different narrators about these women. In fact, such in- <br>cidents happened in large numbers with many women of <br>that time. <br>4. <br>The Behaviour of Sahabah at Hudeybiyah. <br>The campaign of Hudeybiyah took place in 6 A.H., <br>when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with a large <br>number of Sahabah was going to Mecca with the intention <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>otherwise not.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to the pro- <br>posal of ~ b b  <br>to<br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and decided <br>march ahead towards Mecca. When he reached Hudey- <br>biyah, Budail bin Waraqa Khuza'i met him with a group of <br>! <br>people. He said: <br>\"The Qureysh uncler no circumstances will permit <br>i <br>your entry intb Mecca. They are already drawn up in <br>battle array.\" <br>At this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>I <br>\"We have come to perform 'Umrah only and have no <br>intention to fight. Frequent battles have already inflic- <br>ted heavy casualties on Qureysh. If, therefore, they <br>agree, I am prepared to talk over a no-war pact with <br>them, so that they do not fight with me and I may deal <br>with others. If, however, Qureysh do not see their way <br>to accepting this proposal, then by Him who holds my <br>i<br>life in His hand, I will fight them till at last either <br>i<br>Islam prevails or I am slain.\" <br>I <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah: <br>\"Go and faun upon your goddess 'Lat'! We will by no <br>means flee away and leave the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) by himself.\" <br>'Urwah asked: \"Who is he?\" <br>The Prophet: <br>'Urwah: <br>\"He is Abu Bakr.\" <br>\"Abu Bakr! I am in<br>turn you have done <br>for this, I would <br>abuse.\" <br>debted <br>to m<br>have <br>to you f<br>replied <br>e in the <br>or a <br>to <br>good <br>past. But <br>your <br>'Urwah then resumed his deliberations with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). 'Urwah occasionally touched <br>the beard of the Prophet (according to the Arab custom) as <br>he talked. The Sahabah could not tolerate this. Accord- <br>ingly, 'Urwah's own nephew Mughirah bin Shu'bah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was standing armed near by, struck <br>Urwah's hand with the handle of his sword and said: <br>\"Keep your hand away.\" <br>'Urwah: <br>\"Who is he?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the <br>ground arid anoint their faces with it. Hardly a word <br>escapes his lips before all of them run to carry out his <br>wish. When he makes Wudhu, they fight with one an- <br>other to collect some drop of the used water before it <br>t <br>falls on the ground. If any one fails to get that water. he <br>touches the wet hands of the persori who had got it <br>arid then rubs his own hands on the face. When they <br>speak in his presence, they speak in low voice. They <br>I <br>do not lift their gaze to look at his face, out of respect <br>! <br>for him. A hair falling from his head or beard is pre- <br>served to get benediction from it arid is looked upon as <br>i<br>a sacred relic. In short, I have never seen any group of <br>people so devoted to their master as I have seen the <br>companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) towards him.\" <br>At long last, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was commis- <br>sioned by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to nego- <br>tiate with the Qureysh, as he, in spite of his conversion to <br>Islam, commanded respect with them. When 'Usman (Rad- <br>hivallaho anho) had left for Mecca, some of the Sahabah <br>envied Usman's luck in (as they thought) being able to per- <br>form l'awaf of the house of Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on the other hand remarked: <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>249 s= <br>a\"\" <br>o a  <br>\"I do not think he will ever like to do 'l'awaf without <br>me.\" <br>However when 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) entered <br>Mecca, Abaan bi'il Sa'eed took him in his protection and <br>said to him: <br>.:$<br>Svl<br>fa <br>\"You roam where you like. Nobody car1 touch vou.\" <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) carried 011 his negotiations <br>with Abu Sufyan and other chiefs of Mecca on behalf of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and, when he was <br>about to return, the Qureysh the~nselves said to him: <br>\"Now when vou are here at Mecca, you can perforin <br>Tawaf before you return.\" <br>He replied: \"How can it be possible for me when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihc wasailam) has been <br>prevented by you <br>people from ellterilig <br>Mecca.\" <br>This reply was nlost unpalatable for the Qureysh and they <br>decided to detain 'Usman (Kadhivallaho anho) at Mecca. A <br>news reached the Muslims that 'Usnlan (Kadhiyallilho <br>aliho) had been martyred. On this news reaching the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he took the oath of al- <br>legiance from all Sahabah ta fight to the litst drop of their <br>blood. When the Qureysh learnt of this, they got frighteried <br>and imrnediatelv released 'Usrnan (liadhiyallaho anho). <br>In this story, Abu 13akr's (liadhivallaho anho) insultitlg <br>'Urrvah.

XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>223 sz<br>Ir <br>0 <br>.! <br>o e  <br>7. <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) Gets Preference for <br>His Qur'an. <br>m<br>S m  <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) was six <br>when he lost his father. He was eleven at the time of <br>Hijrah.<br>He offered himself for the battle of Badr, but was re- <br>jected on account of his tender age. He again volunteered <br>for Uhud. This time also he was not permitted, as we saw <br>in the last story. He had since then been participating in all <br>the campaigns. While the Mujahidin were marching to- <br>wards Tabuk, the flag of Banu Malik clan was held by Am- <br>marah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bade him <br>make over the flag to Zaid. Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>thought that perhaps somebody had made a complaint <br>against him, which had displeased the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He therefore said: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Is it due to somebody com-<br>plaining against me?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. But Zaid knows more Qur'an than you do. His <br>Qur'an has given him preference.\" <br>It was common with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that he gave preference to the people in accordance <br>with their virtues. Although this was an occasion of battle. <br>and a knowledge of the Qur'an had no direct bearing on the <br>issue, yet the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave <br>preference to Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) for his Qur'an. This <br>distinction we find on other occasions as well. When a <br>number of dead persons had to be accommodated in one <br>grave (as in Uhud), they were buried in the order of their <br>knowledge of the Qur'an, priority being given to those who <br>knew more of it. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri's (Radhiyallaho anhoj Re- <br>straint. <br>Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"I was <br>presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by <br>my father for fighting at Uhud, when I was thirteen. My <br>father recommended me saying: <br>'0,Prophet of Allah! He has a very good body. His <br>bones are very well-developed.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) looked at me <br>again and again, and finally rejected me due to my young <br>age. My father, however, participated in the battle and was <br>killed. He left me nothing to live on. I went to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to seek some financial help <br>from him. Before I could express myself, he addressed me <br>saying: <br>'Abu Saeed! Whoso seeks endurance from Allah! gets <br>it; Whoso seeks chastity from Him, gets it; And whoso <br>seeks contentment from Him will surely get it.' <br>After hearing this, I returned home without making any re- <br>quest to him. On this, Allah blessed him with such an <br>exalted position that, among the younger Sahabah, there is <br>nobody endowed with so much knowledge and learning as <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Look at the restraint of Abu Sa'eed at such a young age. <br>As we know, in Uhud he had lost his father who had left <br>him nothing to live on and therefore he fully deserved all <br>help; yet a few words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) stopped him from talking of his distress and seek- <br>ing a favour. Can a person much older than him show such <br>a strength of character? In fact, the persons selected by <br>Allah for the company of his dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) did really deserve that honour. That is <br>why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"Allah has preferred my conlpanions over all other <br>men.\" <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Salmih bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>faces the Bandits. <br>Ghabah was a small village at four or five miles from <br>Madinah. The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>camels were sent to that place for grazing. Abdur Rahman <br>Fazari, with the help of a few disbelievers, killed the <br>person looking after the camels and took them away. The <br>bandits were riding their horses, and all of them were <br>armed. Salmah bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) was going <br>on foot in the morning with his bow and arrows, when he <br>happened to see the bandits. He was only a boy but he ran <br>very fast. It is said that he could beat the fastest horse in <br>race. He was also a very good archer. No sooner did he see <br>the bandits than he climbed up a hill and shouted towards <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>Madinah to raise an alarm. He then chased the bandits and, <br>on approaching near them, started sending arrows one after <br>the other. He did this so swiftly and incessantly that the <br>bandits thought they were being chased by a large number <br>of people. If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow. The bandits at once retreated at <br>full speed to escape from being captured. Salmah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I kept on chasing the bandits till all the camels taken <br>away by them were behind me. Besides, in their flight <br>they left behind 30 spears and 30 sheets of cloth of <br>their own. Meanwhile, Uyainah bin Hisn (another <br>bandit) and his party arrived on the scene to reinforce <br>the bandits. They had meanwhile come to know that I <br>was all alone. They now chased me in large concentra- <br>tion and I was compelled to climb up a hill. As they <br>were about to approach me I shouted, 'Stop. First <br>listen to me. Do you know who am I? I am Ibnul <br>Akwah. By Him who has given glory to Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), if anyone of you chases <br>me. he cannot catch me. On the other hand, if I run <br>after any of you he cannot escape me.' I kept on talking <br>to them in that strain to beguile them till, I thought. <br>help would reach me from Madinah. I looked anx-<br>iously through the trees, as I talked to them when at <br>last, I noticed a group of riders headed by Akhram <br>Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) coming towards me. As <br>Akhram approached the bandits, he attacked Abdur <br>Rahman and cut one leg of his horse. Abdur Rahman, <br>as he fell down from the horse, attacked Akhram and <br>killed him. Abu Qatadah (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>meanwhile arrived. In the combat that ensued. Abdur <br>Rahman lost his life and Abu Qatadah his horse.\" <br>It is written in some books of history that, when <br>Akhram was going to attack Abdur Rahman, Salmah ad- <br>vised him to wait till the rest of his people had joined him. <br>But he did not wait. saying: <br>\"I wish to die as a martyr in the path of Allah.\" <br>He was the only person killed from among the Muslims. <br>The bandits lost a good number of their men. The11 more <br>reinforcement reached the Muslims, and the bandits took <br>to their heels. Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) sought the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) permission to <br>pursue them saying: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah! Let me have one hundred men, I <br>shall teach them a lesson.\" <br>But the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. They would have by now reached their bases.\" <br>Most of the historians say that Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was hardly 12 or 13 at that time. Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them. This was the outcome of Iman and <br>Ikhlas, with which Allah had imbued the hearts of those <br>blessed people. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Bara's (Radhiyallaho anho) eagerness to Join <br>in Badr. <br>Badr was the most gallant and illustrious battle ever <br>fought by the Muslims, who were faced with very heavy <br>odds. There were 313 men, 3 horses, seventy camels, six or <br>nine coats of arms and eight swords with the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), while the Qureysh had about <br>1000 men, 100 horses, 700 camels, and were armed to their <br>teeth. The Qureysh were so sure of their victory that they <br>had brought with them musical instruments and song-<br>stresses to celebrate the victory. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was very anxious because of the heavy <br>odds against him. Heprayed to Allah saying: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy faithful slaves are barefooted; Thou and <br>only Thou can provide them with animals to ride <br>upon. They are naked; Thou and only Thou can clothe <br>them. They are poor; Thou and only Thou can sustain <br>them.\" <br>Allah granted his prayer and gave the most glorious victory <br>to the Muslims. <br>In spite of knowing the strength of the Qureysh, Ab- <br>dullah bin 'Umar and Bara bin Azib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), in eagerness to join the battle, had come out with <br>the Mujahidin. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>however, in consideration of their tender age, did not <br>permit them to proceed to the battle-field. <br><br>As we have already seen, both these boys were also re- <br>jected for the same reason at the time of Uhud, which took <br>place one year after Badr. Look at the wonderful spirit of <br>the youngsters of that time that they were anxious to obtain <br>permission for participating in every battle. <br>11. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus: <br>\"All this is the outcome of the seed that you people <br>have sown with your own hands. You provided refuge <br>to these strangers (meaning Muhajirin) in your town <br>and shared your wealth equally with them. If you <br>withdraw your help from them, they will be obliged to <br>go back.\" <br>He further said: <br>\"By Allah! On return to Madinah, we, the respected <br>people, shall drive out these mean people from there.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho), an Ansari <br>boy was listening to him. He could not tolerate these words <br>and at once retorted by saying to him: <br>\"By Allah! You yourself are wretched. Even your own <br>people look down upon you, and nobody will support <br>you. Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>honoured. He is exalted by Rahman and revered by his <br>followers.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ubayy said: <br>\"All right. Do not mention it to anybody. It was only a <br>jest; I was not serious in w h t  I said.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>statement and took no action against him. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know that the Munafiq had suc- <br>ceeded in , beguiling the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through false oaths, he would not come out for <br>shame of being considered a liar by the people. He would <br>not even go to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At <br>last, Allah revealed Soorah A1 Munafiqoon, in which the <br>report of Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was confirmed and the <br>Munafiq was exposed. After this, all people began to <br>honour Zaid and look down upon the Munafiq. <br>Now the Munafiq (Abdullah bin Ubayy) had a son. His <br>name was also Abdullah and he was a very sincere <br>Muslim. When the Mujahidin were about to reach Madi- <br>nah, he drew out his sword and stood just outside the town <br>and, in a challenging tone, said to his Munafiq father: <br>\"I will not allow you to enter Madinah, until you <br>admit with your own tongue that it is you who is mean <br>and Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>exalted.\" <br>This surprised him very much, as the son had always been <br>very respectful to kim, but now he was prepared to kill <br>him, his own father, for the honour of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). The Munafiq had to declare: <br><br>0)<br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>229 3% <br>L.0 4 <br>\"By Allah! I am mean, and Muhammad (Sallallaho 8 g  <br>alaihe wasallam) is most exalted.\" <br>2;<br>G <br>He was then allowed to enter the town. <br>12. Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) Eagerness to <br>Fight. <br>When the battle of Uhud was over, the remnant of Sa- <br>habah returned to Madinah, most tired and broken. When <br>the Qureysh, on their way back to Mecca, were camping at <br>a place called Hamra-ul Asad, their chief, Abu Sufyan, sat <br>in council with his lieutenants. They said among them- <br>selves: <br>\"The Muslims are defeated in Uhud. Their morale <br>must be very low. This is the best time to finish Mu- <br>hammad.\" <br>They, therefore, decided to return and attack Madinah. <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) received in- <br>telligence about this council, he ordered all those Sahabah <br>who had participated in Uhud, and who had just returned <br>from the battle, to move out of Madinah and meet the <br>enemy on the way. <br>Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I was very eager to fight in Uhud, <br>but my father prevented me from going, on the plea <br>that there was no other member in the house to look <br>after my seven sisters and only one of us could join the <br>campaign. As he had made up his mind to go, he bade <br>me stay back with the family. He met the most coveted <br>end [i.e., martyrdom) in Uhud. Now I am very eager to <br>go with you this time and fight the Qureysh.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) allowed him to <br>go. He was the only person in that campaign who had not <br>fought in Uhud. <br>Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) father was mar-<br>tyred in Uhud. He left Jabir a big family to look after and <br>large debts to clear, with nothing to live on. The debts were <br>due to one of the Jews, who as we know seldom have any <br>soft corner in their hearts for their debtors. Also his seven <br>sisters for whose sake he was not allowed to go to Uhud- <br>were still there to be boked after. Now look! inspite of all <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage, 100 000 dinars in prize, and also <br>governorship over the area now ruled by him.\" <br>The fighi was very tough and went on for a long time. <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) succeeded in spotting <br>Jarjir seated behind his forces, under an umbrella of <br>peacock feathers held by two maids. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), all at once, outskirted the Roman <br>troops and approached him. He attacked Jarjir with his <br>sword and severed his head from his body. He then <br>fixed the head oh the point of his spear and returned to <br>his camp, to the utter amazement of both the armies at <br>his matchless valour. <br>When the Sahabah emigrated to Madinah, no son was <br>borne to any of the emigrants for one year after the emigra- <br>tion. The Jews of Madinah said: <br>\"We have cast a spell on the emigrants. They cannot <br>have male issue.\" <br>Abdullah 'bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was the first <br>male child born to the Muhajirin. The Muslims were, natu- <br>rally, very happy over his birth. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not generally allow the children to <br>take oath of allegiance to him. But Abdullah bin Zubair <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>231 gz <br>Gm;g<br>a <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had the honour of pledging allegiance .=+<br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) when he was <br>g m<br>* <br>only seven. During this battle, he was barely in his early <br>twenties. To go single-handed and kill the commander, <br>after hoodwinking his army of 200 000 men, at this age is <br>really marvellous. <br>14. \t Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) Leads <br>in Salaat. <br>Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We lived with our father at a place on the caravan <br>route to Madinah. When a caravan from Madinah <br>passed our village, we asked the people therein about <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They would <br>tell us that he claimed to be receiving revelations from <br>Allah, and they would also recite a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before us to give us an idea about his claim. <br>Then I immediately used to commit those verses to <br>memory. In this way, I remembered a good portion of <br>the Qur'an, even before I embraced Islam. All the <br>desert tribes were waiting for Mecca to fall to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) before they em- <br>braced Islam. On his victorious entry into Mecca, <br>deputations from all the tribes began to come to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in order to accept <br>Islam. My father headed the group who went to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pledge alle- <br>giance to him on behalf of our tribe. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) taught them the basic <br>regulations about Salaat and other Islamic practices. <br>He said to them, \"The person who knows more Qur'an <br>is entitled to lead in Salaat. Now it so happened that <br>none in my tribe knew so much Qur'an as I did. They <br>searched for an Imam, but they could not find a person <br>knowing more Qur'an than me. I was, therefore, made <br>Imam. At that time, I was only seven. I led the congre; <br>gational Salaat and funeral service if any.\" <br>It was his natural inclination and affinity towards Islam <br>that made him remember so much of the Qur'an when he <br>was only a boy and he had not even embraced Islam. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) used <br>to say to the people: <br>\"Come to me for your difficulties in understanding the <br>Qur'an. I memorised it while I was only a child.\" <br>In another Hadith, he is reported to have said: <br>\"I had completed my reading of the Qur'an when I'was <br>only ten.\" <br>r <br>The reading of the Qur'an by Sahabah was not done <br>like the reading by the non-Arabs of today. Whatever they <br>read, they read with full meaning and explanation. As the <br>impression of something memorised in childhood is very <br>deep and permanent, so Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is accepted as Imam in Tafsir. None of the Sahabah <br>has narrated more Ahadith explaining the meaning of <br>Qur'an than was done by Ibn Abbas. Abdullah bin Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is the best <br>commentator of the Qur'an.\" <br>Abu Abdur Rahman (Rahmatullah alaih), on the authority <br>of Sahabah who taught him the Qur'an, says: <br><br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was saying his Salaat. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>joined him in Salaat by standing behind him. The Prophet <br>caught him by the hand and drew him to his side. (When <br>there is only one follower in Salaat with Jamaat, he stands <br>by the side of Imam and not after him). While the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was busy in Salaat, he moved <br>back a little distance. When the Salaat was over, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him: <br>\"What made you recede from your place?\" <br>Hesaid: \t \"You are the Prophet of Allah!. How could I <br>stand with you.\" <br>On this occasion too, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) prayed for his knowledge and understanding. <br>17. \t ~ b d u l l a hbin Amr bin Aas Notes Down Ahadith: <br>Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>one of the most pious Sahabah. Daily he used to fast during <br>the day, and finish one Qur'an during the night. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) restrained him from <br>this excessive devotion and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger <br>or humour are actually not meant by him. You should <br>not write each and every thing spoken by him.' I ac- <br>cepted the advice. On my once mentioning this to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he said, 'You <br>keep doing as before. By Him who holds my life in His <br>hand, my lips do not utter anything except the truth, <br>even in anger or joy.\" <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"No one has narrated about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) more than me, except Abdullah bin <br>Amr. This is because he used to note down what he <br>heard, while I relied on my memory.\" <br>This is really wonderful, especially when we know that <br>most of his time was reading the Qur'an and other acts of <br>piety. <br>18. Zaid bin Thabit Memorises the Qur'an. <br>Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of those <br>eminent Sahabah who are considered to be most learned <br>and whose words in religious matters carry much weight. <br>He was an expert in regulations regarding obligatory prac- <br>tices. It is said that he was among the top ranking jurists, <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading. I desire you to learn the Jewish lan- <br>guage.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"In fifteen days, I mastered Hebrew and after that I <br>started doing all such correspondence for him.\" <br>According to another Hadith, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is reported to have similarly mastered the Syriac language <br>at the instance of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>He managed this within the short period of 17 days only. <br>19. Hasan's Knowledge of Islam. <br>The head of Sayyids, Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>born in Ramadhan, 3 A. H. He was thus a little over seven <br>years old at the time of the Prophet's death. In spite of his <br>tender age, quite a few Ahadith have been narrated by him. <br>Abul Howraa once asked him: <br>\"Do you remember any saying of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Yes. Once I was going with him. On the way I saw a <br>large quantity of dates of Sadaqah piled up at one <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah! Guide me along with those whom Thou <br>hast guided. Keep me in ease along with those whom <br>Thou hast kept in ease. Be my protecting friend along <br>with those whose protecting friend Thou has been. <br>Bless me in what Thou hast granted me. Grant me pro- <br>tection against the ill-effects of what may have been or- <br>dained for me, for Thy decision is final and nobody <br>can decide against Thy will. He who has Thee as the <br>protecting Friend cannot be abased. 0,Our Lord! Thou <br>art blessed and Thou art the Highest.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>\"The person who keeps sitting till sunrise at the place <br>where he said his Fajr prayers shall be saved from the <br>Hell.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) performed his Hajj many times <br>by covering the distance from Madinah to Mecca on foot <br>and, when asked about his reasons for undergoing such <br>hardships. he remarked: <br>\"I feel ashamed to face Allah (after my death) without <br>having gone to Mecca on foot for pilgrimage tp his <br>House.\" <br>Hasan is reputed for his piety and mildness. He is respon- <br>sible for narrating many Ahadith, collected by Imaam <br><br>Ahmad in his Musnad. The author of 'Talqih' has included <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) among those who have reported <br>as many as 13 Ahadith. To have remembered so many Aha- <br>dith at the age of 7 shows his devotion to Islam and his re- <br>markable memory. On the other hand, our children at this <br>age generally do not know even the elements of Islam. <br>20. \t Husain's Zeal for Knowledge. <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was one year junior to <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anha), his brother. He was a little over <br>6 at the time of the Prophet's death. Nothing much can be <br>expected from a child of this age, but there are quite a few <br>Ahadith narrated by Husain (Radhiyallaho anho). Muhad- <br>dithin count him among those Sahabah who are respon- <br>sible for giving us at least 8 Ahadith. <br>The following Ahadith are among those narrated by <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>1. \t \"Each time a person recites 'Inna-lillahi-wa-inna- <br>Ilaihi-raaji-oon' when he recalls or is otherwise re- <br>minded of an adversity previously met by him, he <br>receives a reward from Allah as good as he would <br>have had at the time of actual infliction.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"A Muslim gets immunity from drowning while <br>crossing a river if, at the time of embarking, he re- <br>cites: \". O <br>* 0 ! ;  <br>0 , .  <br>( t r \t y)wj jpJJJ d! kL>j G$+ <br>& <br>(In the name of Allah be its course and its moor- <br>ing. Lo! My Lord is, surely, most Forgiving, most <br>Merciful).\" <br>3. \t \"To shun vain things makes one a good Muslim.\" <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once asked Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) if he re-<br>membered any incident in the life of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'Yes. Once <br>managed to get on to a few dates lying near a window <br>and put one of them into my mouth. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) bade me take out and throw <br>away the date, as we (i.e. his family members) were not <br>permitted to eat anything from Sadaqah.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) had gone on foot 25 times <br>for pilgrimage to Mecca. He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here- <br>after. In childhood the memory is at its best. Anything <br>memorised at that time is seldom forgotten. If children are <br>made to memorise the Qur'an, they will be able to do so <br>very easily and quickly. I have heard very frequently from <br>the elderly ladies of my family and from my respected <br>father himself that he had memorised one fourth of the <br>thirtieth part of the Qur'an even before he was weaned, and <br>he had finished memorising the whole Qur'an and, on the <br>top of that, he had read a few standard books in Persian lit- <br>erature (the latter 6f his own accord) while he was only <br>seven. He once narrated to me: <br>\"When I had finished memorising the Qur'an, my <br>father required me to repeat (from memory) the full <br>Qur'an once daily, and permitted me to play for the <br>rest of the day. I used to sit on the roof of the house <br>(being summer) and start reciting the Qur'an just after <br>Fajr. I would finish the whole of it in about seven <br>hours. I then had my lunch. In the evening, I used to <br>have lessons in Persian, though it was not compulsory <br>for me. To this routine I stuck for full six months.\" <br>It is not an ordinary thing for a child of seven to recite <br>the Qur'an once daily for full six months, along with learn- <br><br>ing other things. As a result, he would never forget or <br>commit an error when reciting the Qur'an from memory. <br>Apparently, he earned his livelihood by trade in books. He <br>was found reciting the Qur'an with his lips, even when his <br>hands were engaged in his job. Sometimes he would even <br>teach the boys (who wanted to learn from him after the <br>school hours), while himself reciting the Qur'an and doing <br>his job. He thus attended to three things at a time. But his <br>way of teaching his students was different from that <br>adopted currently in the schools, where the entire burden <br>is on the teachers. He simply listened to the student <br>reading, translating and explaining the meaning. If the stu- <br>dent was correct, he simply said, \"'Go ahead,\" but if the <br>student made some error or needed some further explana- <br>tion, then he only would correct or explain as the gase <br>might be. Now, this story is not of ancient times; this has <br>happened only recently. It is therefore wrong to presume <br>jhat the Muslims of today, being of poor physical strength, <br>cannot try to follow the footsteps of their ancestors in <br>Islam. <br><br>CHAPTER XI1 <br>LOVE FOR THE PROPHET <br>What we have hitherto read about the achievement of <br>the Sahabah in their time was in fact the result of their love <br>for Allah and for His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Love, as a matter of fact, was a great dynamic force in the <br>Sahabah's career. It was this force that made them forego <br>their luxuries, forget their lives, give up all their desires for <br>wealth, ignore all afflictions, and have no fear of death <br>even. There is no room for any other consideration (except <br>that of beloved) in the heart saturated with love. May Allah <br>through His Grace grant us His own love and that of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), so that we may be <br>blessed with devotion in His worship and have sense of <br>comfort in all difficulties faced in His service. <br>1. Abu Bakr's [Radhiyallaho anho) Sufferings for Islam. <br>In the beginning, those who embraced Islam had to <br>keep their faith secret, as far as possible. As the Muslims <br>were being constantly persecuted by the Qureysh, even the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised all new con- <br>verts to practise Islam secretly, so that they might not have <br>to suffer at the hands of Qureysh. When, however, the <br>number of Muslims reached 39, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) made a suggestion for the open preaching and prac- <br>tising of Islam. ThepProphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>would not agree, but, when Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>insisted. he gave his consent and so all of them went to <br>Haram for Tabligh. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) began to <br>speak, and the Khutbah given by him was the first ever de- <br>livered in the annals of Islam. Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>i <br>the Prophet's uncle and the Chief of Martyrs embraced <br>k <br>Islam on that very day, while 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came into the Muslim fold on the third day of this address. <br>No sooner did Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) start speaking <br>I<br>than the idolaters and disbelievers from amongst the Qu- <br>reysh fell upon the Muslims from all sides. Despite the fact <br>that he was considered to be the noblest and most respect- <br>able of all the people in Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was beaten to such an extent that his nose and ears <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>241 4c <br>$2<br>and his entire face were besmeared with blood. He was <br>kicked. thrashed with shoes, trampled under feet and han- <br>8 1  <br>dled most roughly and savagely. He became unconscious <br>vlI g  <br>and half-dead; none hoped that he would ever survive this <br>brutal onslaught. Banu Teem, the people of his clan, came <br>and carried him to his house. They also announced in the <br>Haram that if Abu Bakr succumbed to the injuries, they <br>would in retaliation take the life of Utbah bin Rabee'ah, <br>who had taken the most active part in the attack. Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) remained unconscious the whole day. <br>People round him shouted his name again and again to <br>know if he was in senses, but he would not speak. Late in <br>the evening however he opened his eyes and showed signs <br>of consciousness. As soon as he was able to speak, he en- <br>quired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>The people were most disappointed with him and they <br>said: <br>\"How is it that, despite all this calamity and after vir- <br>tually remaining in the jaws of death all day long on <br>account of the Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as <br>soon as he has come back to consciousness he has <br>nothing else to talk about, but the Prophet himself.\" <br>They left Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), much disgusted at <br>his devotion for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while they were satisfied that he was out of danger. They <br>advised Umme Khair, his mother, to give him something to <br>eat. But least minding his food, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) would incessantly and impatiently ask his mother <br>the same question again and again i.e. <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>On her showing ignorance about the welfare of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), Abu Bakr entreated <br>her to go to Umme Jamil (Umar's sister) and find out from <br>her the latest news about the Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The mother could not refuse the request of her son <br>in this pitiable condition, and hurried to Umme Jamil's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) house to enquire about the welfare of <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Like,other Mus- <br>lims of that time, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallah anha) was also <br>keeping her faith secret. She therefore concealed her <br>Stories of the Scrhaabah <br>knowledge about the Prophet (SallalIaho alaihe wasallam), <br>saying: <br>\"Who is Muhammad and who is Abu Bakr? Why <br>should I know anything about them? I am however <br>sorry to learn about the condition of your son; if you <br>like, I can go with you to see him.\" <br>Umme Khair agreed and they both came to Abu Bakr. On <br>seeing Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in that miserable con- <br>dition, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) could not control <br>herself and began to cry, saying: <br>\"Woe to the ruffians for what they have done to a man <br>like Abu Bakr. May Allah punish them for their mis- <br>conduct.\" <br>Regardless of what Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) said, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had the same words on his <br>lips viz: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil (pointing towards Umme Khair): <br>\"Is it safe to say anything in her presence?\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"Do not worry about her. Tell me quickly <br>i <br>how is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil: \"He is quite well.\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: <br>\"Where is he at this moment.\" <br>Umme Jamil: \t \"Heis at Arqam's place.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"By Allah! I will not eat anything until I <br>have looked at him.\" <br>Now, his mother was very anxious to feed him. She <br>knew that when he had sworn by Allah he would not break <br>his oath and, therefore, would not eat under any circum- <br>stances. She therefore agreed to take him to Arqam's place. <br>She had to wait till the street was least-frequented by the <br>people and she was able to take him to that place unde- <br>tected by Qureysh. When they both reached Arqam's place, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and clung to him weeping profusely. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reciprocated, and all <br>the Muslims who were present there also began to weep <br><br>bitterly over the condition of Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) then iptroduced his <br>mother Umme Khair to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), saying: <br>\"She is my mother, 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for her <br>and induce her to accept Islam.\" <br>The prophet first prayed for her and then preached to her. <br>She accepted Islam there and then. <br>Many people can claim to be lovers while in ease and <br>comfort. But a lover is a real lover when he is able to prove <br>his love even in the tribulation and adversity. <br>2. \t<br>'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Grief at the Prophet's <br>Death. <br>None can deny the proverbial valour, courage and <br>strength of 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), over whose men- <br>tion, even after the lapse of 1400 years, hearts are struck <br>with awe and respect. Islam could not be professed and <br>preached openly before 'Umar's coming into its fold. As <br>soon as he embraced Islam, the Muslims started saying <br>Salaat in the Haram, as none could dare harm them with <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their side. Notwithstanding <br>all this, he could not bear the shock of the Prophet passing <br>away. So much so that he stood with sword in his hand, ut- <br>terly confused and bewildered, saying: <br>\"I shall behead the person who says that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has passed away. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has only gone to <br>visit his Lord, just as Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone <br>to Toor. He will shortly return and cut off the hands <br>and feet of those who were spreading the false news of <br>his death.\" <br>On the other hand, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>stunned with grief on this event. He could not utter a single <br>word, even till the next day, and walked about as if bereft <br>of speech. Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), too, was in terrible <br>grief. He was still and motionless. Only Abu Bakr, (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) for all his love of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as we have seen in the last story, stood <br>firm as a rock against this terrible storm of grief and did not <br>lose his mental composure. He calmly entered the Proph- <br>et's house, kissed his forehead and came back to the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>As Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was destined to be <br>the Khalifah after the Prophet, (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) <br>E<br>it is significa~t that, unlike other Sahabah, he behaved with <br>the composure and patience that were needed on an oc- <br>casion like this. Again. it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) alone who knew better than anybody else about the <br>regulations regarding the burial, inheritance, etc, of the <br>Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam). When difference of <br>opinion arose among the Sahabah whether the burial place <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) be at Mecca or <br>Madinah or jerusalenl, it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) who settled the difference by saying on the authority <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the Proph- <br>ets are buried where they have died. There were several <br>other Ahadith known only to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that helped solve many of the other problems arising <br>/<br>out of the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>t <br>lam). Some of these Ahadith were: \t<br>i <br>(1) \"Prophets have no heirs. All that a Prophet leaves <br>behind is Sadaqah.\" <br>i<br>(2) \t\"Allah's curse is on the Amir who does not take <br>proper interest and excercise proper care in the ap- <br>pointment of his deputies.\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was told that he was safe and sound, but she would not rest <br>contented, and insisted on seeing him herself. When at last <br>she had satisfied her eyes with his sight, she said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, every affliction is eased and every <br>worry removed with the blessing of seeing you.\" <br>According to another version, she herself clung to the <br>Prophet's robes and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to me than my par- <br>ents. The death of my kinsmen has lost all its sting for <br>me when I have seen you living.\" <br>There are several incidents of this kind that occurred <br>after the battle of Uhud. It is, perhaps, for the large number <br>of such incidents that different names have been reported <br>by different narrators about these women. In fact, such in- <br>cidents happened in large numbers with many women of <br>that time. <br>4. <br>The Behaviour of Sahabah at Hudeybiyah. <br>The campaign of Hudeybiyah took place in 6 A.H., <br>when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with a large <br>number of Sahabah was going to Mecca with the intention <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>otherwise not.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to the pro- <br>posal of ~ b b  <br>to<br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and decided <br>march ahead towards Mecca. When he reached Hudey- <br>biyah, Budail bin Waraqa Khuza'i met him with a group of <br>! <br>people. He said: <br>\"The Qureysh uncler no circumstances will permit <br>i <br>your entry intb Mecca. They are already drawn up in <br>battle array.\" <br>At this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>I <br>\"We have come to perform 'Umrah only and have no <br>intention to fight. Frequent battles have already inflic- <br>ted heavy casualties on Qureysh. If, therefore, they <br>agree, I am prepared to talk over a no-war pact with <br>them, so that they do not fight with me and I may deal <br>with others. If, however, Qureysh do not see their way <br>to accepting this proposal, then by Him who holds my <br>i<br>life in His hand, I will fight them till at last either <br>i<br>Islam prevails or I am slain.\" <br>I <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah: <br>\"Go and faun upon your goddess 'Lat'! We will by no <br>means flee away and leave the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) by himself.\" <br>'Urwah asked: \"Who is he?\" <br>The Prophet: <br>'Urwah: <br>\"He is Abu Bakr.\" <br>\"Abu Bakr! I am in<br>turn you have done <br>for this, I would <br>abuse.\" <br>debted <br>to m<br>have <br>to you f<br>replied <br>e in the <br>or a <br>to <br>good <br>past. But <br>your <br>'Urwah then resumed his deliberations with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). 'Urwah occasionally touched <br>the beard of the Prophet (according to the Arab custom) as <br>he talked. The Sahabah could not tolerate this. Accord- <br>ingly, 'Urwah's own nephew Mughirah bin Shu'bah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was standing armed near by, struck <br>Urwah's hand with the handle of his sword and said: <br>\"Keep your hand away.\" <br>'Urwah: <br>\"Who is he?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the <br>ground arid anoint their faces with it. Hardly a word <br>escapes his lips before all of them run to carry out his <br>wish. When he makes Wudhu, they fight with one an- <br>other to collect some drop of the used water before it <br>t <br>falls on the ground. If any one fails to get that water. he <br>touches the wet hands of the persori who had got it <br>arid then rubs his own hands on the face. When they <br>speak in his presence, they speak in low voice. They <br>I <br>do not lift their gaze to look at his face, out of respect <br>! <br>for him. A hair falling from his head or beard is pre- <br>served to get benediction from it arid is looked upon as <br>i<br>a sacred relic. In short, I have never seen any group of <br>people so devoted to their master as I have seen the <br>companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) towards him.\" <br>At long last, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was commis- <br>sioned by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to nego- <br>tiate with the Qureysh, as he, in spite of his conversion to <br>Islam, commanded respect with them. When 'Usman (Rad- <br>hivallaho anho) had left for Mecca, some of the Sahabah <br>envied Usman's luck in (as they thought) being able to per- <br>form l'awaf of the house of Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on the other hand remarked: <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>249 s= <br>a\"\" <br>o a  <br>\"I do not think he will ever like to do 'l'awaf without <br>me.\" <br>However when 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) entered <br>Mecca, Abaan bi'il Sa'eed took him in his protection and <br>said to him: <br>.:$<br>Svl<br>fa <br>\"You roam where you like. Nobody car1 touch vou.\" <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) carried 011 his negotiations <br>with Abu Sufyan and other chiefs of Mecca on behalf of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and, when he was <br>about to return, the Qureysh the~nselves said to him: <br>\"Now when vou are here at Mecca, you can perforin <br>Tawaf before you return.\" <br>He replied: \"How can it be possible for me when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihc wasailam) has been <br>prevented by you <br>people from ellterilig <br>Mecca.\" <br>This reply was nlost unpalatable for the Qureysh and they <br>decided to detain 'Usman (Kadhivallaho anho) at Mecca. A <br>news reached the Muslims that 'Usnlan (Kadhiyallilho <br>aliho) had been martyred. On this news reaching the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he took the oath of al- <br>legiance from all Sahabah ta fight to the litst drop of their <br>blood. When the Qureysh learnt of this, they got frighteried <br>and imrnediatelv released 'Usrnan (liadhiyallaho anho). <br>In this story, Abu 13akr's (liadhivallaho anho) insultitlg <br>'Urrvah. Mughirah's (Kadhiyallaho anho) treatment of his <br>uncle, the Sahabah's behaviour to\\vards the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe ~lasallanl) as evidenc:ed by 'IJrwiih. and <br>'IJsman's (Kacllii~~allaho <br>anho) refusing to do 'Tawiif '. all <br>speak volumes. aboi~t the love and devotioll of Sahabah for <br>the Prol~het (Sallallnho alaihe wasallam). Tile oath of nlle- <br>giance mentioned in this story is known Bai'atush Shajarah <br>(The Oath of a1 legiance beneath the tree) and is mentioned <br>in the Quran (XLVIII: 18). <br>5. <br>Ibn Zubair's (~adhi~all'aho <br>anho) disposal of blood. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>bled by cupping. The blood was given to Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) to bury it somewhere. He re-<br>turned ant1 informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>lam) that the blood had been disposed of. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves. <br>6. \t Abu 'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) loses His Teeth. <br>During the battle of Uhud, when at one time the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was fiercely attacked <br>by the enemy and two links of the helmet worn by him <br>were struck deep into his head (or face). Abu Bakr and Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) ran to help him. Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) started pulling out the links <br>with his teeth. By the time one of the links was out, he had <br>lost one of his teeth. Without minding this, he again used <br>his teeth to pull up the other link as well. He succeeded in <br>taking out that one too, but he had to lose another tooth in <br>the effort. When the links were drawn out, the blood began <br>to ooze out from the Prophet's body. Malik bin Sinaan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the father of Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), licked the blood with his lips. At this, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The fire of Hell cannot touch the person who has my <br>blood mixed with his.\" <br>7. \t Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) Refuses to Go With His <br>Father. <br>Once in pre-Islam days, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br><br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory. <br>Alas, my lengthening grief and unending distress.\" <br>\"I shall run my swift camels in search of him. I shall <br>search for him round the universe.\" <br>\"The camels may get tired, but I shall not rest, till I <br>die, for death is the end of every hope.\" <br>\"I shall still enjoin on my sons and such and such <br>people, to keep searching for Zaid even after my <br>death.\" <br>.Some people of his clan happened to meet Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) during their pilgrimage to Mecca. They re- <br>lated to him the story of his father's grief and anguish, and <br>recited to him the couplets which he sang in his memory. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) sent a letter to his father through <br>these people. The letter consisted of three couplets ad- <br>dressed to his father assuring him that he was quite well <br>and happy in the present environments with his noble <br>master. When the people went back, they informed his <br>father of his whereabouts and delivered him Zaid's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) message. On receiving the letter, his father <br>and his uncle left for Mecca with sufficient money to <br>ransom Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho). When they came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) they said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Yes, I know them. This is my father and <br>that is my uncl'e.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"And you know me too. They have come to <br>take you back to your home. You have my <br>full permission to go with them. If, on the <br>other hand, you chose to stay on with me, <br>you shall have your choice.\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"How can I prefer anybody else to you? You <br>are everybody for me, including my father <br>and my uncle.\" <br>Zaid's father and uncle: <br>\"0.Zaid! Do you prefer to be a slave? How can you <br>leave your own father, uncle and other members of <br>your family, and remain a bondsman?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Verily, I have seen something in my master <br>that makes me prefer him to everybody else <br>in the world.\" <br>On this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) took Zaid <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) in his lap and said: <br>\"From today, I adopt Zaid as my son.\"</p></div>"

You can imagine the Sahabah's <br>grief and anguish over this tragic news. This, quite natu- <br>rally, caused most of them to lose heart in despair. Anas <br>bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to see 'Umar and <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) with a group of Muslims in <br>a state of utter bewilderment.

He was eleven at the time of <br>Hijrah.<br>He offered himself for the battle of Badr, but was re- <br>jected on account of his tender age. He again volunteered <br>for Uhud. This time also he was not permitted, as we saw <br>in the last story. He had since then been participating in all <br>the campaigns. While the Mujahidin were marching to- <br>wards Tabuk, the flag of Banu Malik clan was held by Am- <br>marah. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) bade him <br>make over the flag to Zaid. Ammarah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>thought that perhaps somebody had made a complaint <br>against him, which had displeased the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He therefore said: <br>\"0, Prophet of Allah! Is it due to somebody com-<br>plaining against me?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. But Zaid knows more Qur'an than you do. His <br>Qur'an has given him preference.\" <br>It was common with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that he gave preference to the people in accordance <br>with their virtues. Although this was an occasion of battle. <br>and a knowledge of the Qur'an had no direct bearing on the <br>issue, yet the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave <br>preference to Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) for his Qur'an. This <br>distinction we find on other occasions as well. When a <br>number of dead persons had to be accommodated in one <br>grave (as in Uhud), they were buried in the order of their <br>knowledge of the Qur'an, priority being given to those who <br>knew more of it. <br>8. \t<br>Hadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri's (Radhiyallaho anhoj Re- <br>straint. <br>Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"I was <br>presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by <br>my father for fighting at Uhud, when I was thirteen.

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>224 <br>Stories of the Sahaabah \t<br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) looked at me <br>again and again, and finally rejected me due to my young <br>age. My father, however, participated in the battle and was <br>killed. He left me nothing to live on. I went to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to seek some financial help <br>from him. Before I could express myself, he addressed me <br>saying: <br>'Abu Saeed! Whoso seeks endurance from Allah! gets <br>it; Whoso seeks chastity from Him, gets it; And whoso <br>seeks contentment from Him will surely get it.' <br>After hearing this, I returned home without making any re- <br>quest to him. On this, Allah blessed him with such an <br>exalted position that, among the younger Sahabah, there is <br>nobody endowed with so much knowledge and learning as <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Look at the restraint of Abu Sa'eed at such a young age. <br>As we know, in Uhud he had lost his father who had left <br>him nothing to live on and therefore he fully deserved all <br>help; yet a few words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) stopped him from talking of his distress and seek- <br>ing a favour. Can a person much older than him show such <br>a strength of character? In fact, the persons selected by <br>Allah for the company of his dear Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) did really deserve that honour. That is <br>why the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"Allah has preferred my conlpanions over all other <br>men.\" <br>9. \t<br>Hadhrat Salmih bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>faces the Bandits. <br>Ghabah was a small village at four or five miles from <br>Madinah. The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>camels were sent to that place for grazing. Abdur Rahman <br>Fazari, with the help of a few disbelievers, killed the <br>person looking after the camels and took them away. The <br>bandits were riding their horses, and all of them were <br>armed. Salmah bin Akwah (Radhiyallaho anho) was going <br>on foot in the morning with his bow and arrows, when he <br>happened to see the bandits. He was only a boy but he ran <br>very fast. It is said that he could beat the fastest horse in <br>race. He was also a very good archer. No sooner did he see <br>the bandits than he climbed up a hill and shouted towards <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>Madinah to raise an alarm. He then chased the bandits and, <br>on approaching near them, started sending arrows one after <br>the other. He did this so swiftly and incessantly that the <br>bandits thought they were being chased by a large number <br>of people. If any of the bandits happened to turn his horse <br>towards him, he hid behind a tree and inflicted wounds on <br>the animal with his arrow. The bandits at once retreated at <br>full speed to escape from being captured. Salmah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I kept on chasing the bandits till all the camels taken <br>away by them were behind me. Besides, in their flight <br>they left behind 30 spears and 30 sheets of cloth of <br>their own. Meanwhile, Uyainah bin Hisn (another <br>bandit) and his party arrived on the scene to reinforce <br>the bandits. They had meanwhile come to know that I <br>was all alone. They now chased me in large concentra- <br>tion and I was compelled to climb up a hill. As they <br>were about to approach me I shouted, 'Stop. First <br>listen to me. Do you know who am I? I am Ibnul <br>Akwah. By Him who has given glory to Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), if anyone of you chases <br>me. he cannot catch me. On the other hand, if I run <br>after any of you he cannot escape me.' I kept on talking <br>to them in that strain to beguile them till, I thought. <br>help would reach me from Madinah. I looked anx-<br>iously through the trees, as I talked to them when at <br>last, I noticed a group of riders headed by Akhram <br>Asadi (Radhiyallaho anho) coming towards me. As <br>Akhram approached the bandits, he attacked Abdur <br>Rahman and cut one leg of his horse. Abdur Rahman, <br>as he fell down from the horse, attacked Akhram and <br>killed him. Abu Qatadah (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>meanwhile arrived. In the combat that ensued. Abdur <br>Rahman lost his life and Abu Qatadah his horse.\" <br>It is written in some books of history that, when <br>Akhram was going to attack Abdur Rahman, Salmah ad- <br>vised him to wait till the rest of his people had joined him. <br>But he did not wait. saying: <br>\"I wish to die as a martyr in the path of Allah.\" <br>He was the only person killed from among the Muslims. <br>The bandits lost a good number of their men. The11 more <br>reinforcement reached the Muslims, and the bandits took <br>to their heels. Salmah (Radhiyallaho anho) sought the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) permission to <br>pursue them saying: <br>\"0.Prophet of Allah! Let me have one hundred men, I <br>shall teach them a lesson.\" <br>But the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. They would have by now reached their bases.\" <br>Most of the historians say that Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was hardly 12 or 13 at that time. Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them. This was the outcome of Iman and <br>Ikhlas, with which Allah had imbued the hearts of those <br>blessed people. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Bara's (Radhiyallaho anho) eagerness to Join <br>in Badr. <br>Badr was the most gallant and illustrious battle ever <br>fought by the Muslims, who were faced with very heavy <br>odds. There were 313 men, 3 horses, seventy camels, six or <br>nine coats of arms and eight swords with the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), while the Qureysh had about <br>1000 men, 100 horses, 700 camels, and were armed to their <br>teeth. The Qureysh were so sure of their victory that they <br>had brought with them musical instruments and song-<br>stresses to celebrate the victory. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was very anxious because of the heavy <br>odds against him. Heprayed to Allah saying: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy faithful slaves are barefooted; Thou and <br>only Thou can provide them with animals to ride <br>upon. They are naked; Thou and only Thou can clothe <br>them. They are poor; Thou and only Thou can sustain <br>them.\" <br>Allah granted his prayer and gave the most glorious victory <br>to the Muslims. <br>In spite of knowing the strength of the Qureysh, Ab- <br>dullah bin 'Umar and Bara bin Azib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), in eagerness to join the battle, had come out with <br>the Mujahidin. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>however, in consideration of their tender age, did not <br>permit them to proceed to the battle-field. <br><br>As we have already seen, both these boys were also re- <br>jected for the same reason at the time of Uhud, which took <br>place one year after Badr. Look at the wonderful spirit of <br>the youngsters of that time that they were anxious to obtain <br>permission for participating in every battle. <br>11. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus: <br>\"All this is the outcome of the seed that you people <br>have sown with your own hands. You provided refuge <br>to these strangers (meaning Muhajirin) in your town <br>and shared your wealth equally with them. If you <br>withdraw your help from them, they will be obliged to <br>go back.\" <br>He further said: <br>\"By Allah! On return to Madinah, we, the respected <br>people, shall drive out these mean people from there.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho), an Ansari <br>boy was listening to him. He could not tolerate these words <br>and at once retorted by saying to him: <br>\"By Allah! You yourself are wretched. Even your own <br>people look down upon you, and nobody will support <br>you. Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>honoured. He is exalted by Rahman and revered by his <br>followers.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ubayy said: <br>\"All right. Do not mention it to anybody. It was only a <br>jest; I was not serious in w h t  I said.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>statement and took no action against him. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know that the Munafiq had suc- <br>ceeded in , beguiling the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through false oaths, he would not come out for <br>shame of being considered a liar by the people. He would <br>not even go to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At <br>last, Allah revealed Soorah A1 Munafiqoon, in which the <br>report of Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was confirmed and the <br>Munafiq was exposed. After this, all people began to <br>honour Zaid and look down upon the Munafiq. <br>Now the Munafiq (Abdullah bin Ubayy) had a son. His <br>name was also Abdullah and he was a very sincere <br>Muslim. When the Mujahidin were about to reach Madi- <br>nah, he drew out his sword and stood just outside the town <br>and, in a challenging tone, said to his Munafiq father: <br>\"I will not allow you to enter Madinah, until you <br>admit with your own tongue that it is you who is mean <br>and Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>exalted.\" <br>This surprised him very much, as the son had always been <br>very respectful to kim, but now he was prepared to kill <br>him, his own father, for the honour of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). The Munafiq had to declare: <br><br>0)<br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>229 3% <br>L.0 4 <br>\"By Allah! I am mean, and Muhammad (Sallallaho 8 g  <br>alaihe wasallam) is most exalted.\" <br>2;<br>G <br>He was then allowed to enter the town. <br>12. Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) Eagerness to <br>Fight. <br>When the battle of Uhud was over, the remnant of Sa- <br>habah returned to Madinah, most tired and broken. When <br>the Qureysh, on their way back to Mecca, were camping at <br>a place called Hamra-ul Asad, their chief, Abu Sufyan, sat <br>in council with his lieutenants. They said among them- <br>selves: <br>\"The Muslims are defeated in Uhud. Their morale <br>must be very low. This is the best time to finish Mu- <br>hammad.\" <br>They, therefore, decided to return and attack Madinah. <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) received in- <br>telligence about this council, he ordered all those Sahabah <br>who had participated in Uhud, and who had just returned <br>from the battle, to move out of Madinah and meet the <br>enemy on the way. <br>Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I was very eager to fight in Uhud, <br>but my father prevented me from going, on the plea <br>that there was no other member in the house to look <br>after my seven sisters and only one of us could join the <br>campaign. As he had made up his mind to go, he bade <br>me stay back with the family. He met the most coveted <br>end [i.e., martyrdom) in Uhud. Now I am very eager to <br>go with you this time and fight the Qureysh.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) allowed him to <br>go. He was the only person in that campaign who had not <br>fought in Uhud. <br>Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) father was mar-<br>tyred in Uhud. He left Jabir a big family to look after and <br>large debts to clear, with nothing to live on. The debts were <br>due to one of the Jews, who as we know seldom have any <br>soft corner in their hearts for their debtors. Also his seven <br>sisters for whose sake he was not allowed to go to Uhud- <br>were still there to be boked after. Now look! inspite of all <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage, 100 000 dinars in prize, and also <br>governorship over the area now ruled by him.\" <br>The fighi was very tough and went on for a long time. <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) succeeded in spotting <br>Jarjir seated behind his forces, under an umbrella of <br>peacock feathers held by two maids. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), all at once, outskirted the Roman <br>troops and approached him. He attacked Jarjir with his <br>sword and severed his head from his body. He then <br>fixed the head oh the point of his spear and returned to <br>his camp, to the utter amazement of both the armies at <br>his matchless valour. <br>When the Sahabah emigrated to Madinah, no son was <br>borne to any of the emigrants for one year after the emigra- <br>tion. The Jews of Madinah said: <br>\"We have cast a spell on the emigrants. They cannot <br>have male issue.\" <br>Abdullah 'bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was the first <br>male child born to the Muhajirin. The Muslims were, natu- <br>rally, very happy over his birth. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not generally allow the children to <br>take oath of allegiance to him. But Abdullah bin Zubair <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>231 gz <br>Gm;g<br>a <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had the honour of pledging allegiance .=+<br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) when he was <br>g m<br>* <br>only seven. During this battle, he was barely in his early <br>twenties. To go single-handed and kill the commander, <br>after hoodwinking his army of 200 000 men, at this age is <br>really marvellous. <br>14. \t Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) Leads <br>in Salaat. <br>Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We lived with our father at a place on the caravan <br>route to Madinah. When a caravan from Madinah <br>passed our village, we asked the people therein about <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They would <br>tell us that he claimed to be receiving revelations from <br>Allah, and they would also recite a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before us to give us an idea about his claim. <br>Then I immediately used to commit those verses to <br>memory. In this way, I remembered a good portion of <br>the Qur'an, even before I embraced Islam. All the <br>desert tribes were waiting for Mecca to fall to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) before they em- <br>braced Islam. On his victorious entry into Mecca, <br>deputations from all the tribes began to come to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in order to accept <br>Islam. My father headed the group who went to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pledge alle- <br>giance to him on behalf of our tribe. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) taught them the basic <br>regulations about Salaat and other Islamic practices. <br>He said to them, \"The person who knows more Qur'an <br>is entitled to lead in Salaat. Now it so happened that <br>none in my tribe knew so much Qur'an as I did. They <br>searched for an Imam, but they could not find a person <br>knowing more Qur'an than me. I was, therefore, made <br>Imam. At that time, I was only seven. I led the congre; <br>gational Salaat and funeral service if any.\" <br>It was his natural inclination and affinity towards Islam <br>that made him remember so much of the Qur'an when he <br>was only a boy and he had not even embraced Islam. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) used <br>to say to the people: <br>\"Come to me for your difficulties in understanding the <br>Qur'an. I memorised it while I was only a child.\" <br>In another Hadith, he is reported to have said: <br>\"I had completed my reading of the Qur'an when I'was <br>only ten.\" <br>r <br>The reading of the Qur'an by Sahabah was not done <br>like the reading by the non-Arabs of today. Whatever they <br>read, they read with full meaning and explanation. As the <br>impression of something memorised in childhood is very <br>deep and permanent, so Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is accepted as Imam in Tafsir. None of the Sahabah <br>has narrated more Ahadith explaining the meaning of <br>Qur'an than was done by Ibn Abbas. Abdullah bin Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is the best <br>commentator of the Qur'an.\" <br>Abu Abdur Rahman (Rahmatullah alaih), on the authority <br>of Sahabah who taught him the Qur'an, says: <br><br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was saying his Salaat. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>joined him in Salaat by standing behind him. The Prophet <br>caught him by the hand and drew him to his side. (When <br>there is only one follower in Salaat with Jamaat, he stands <br>by the side of Imam and not after him). While the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was busy in Salaat, he moved <br>back a little distance. When the Salaat was over, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him: <br>\"What made you recede from your place?\" <br>Hesaid: \t \"You are the Prophet of Allah!. How could I <br>stand with you.\" <br>On this occasion too, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) prayed for his knowledge and understanding. <br>17. \t ~ b d u l l a hbin Amr bin Aas Notes Down Ahadith: <br>Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>one of the most pious Sahabah. Daily he used to fast during <br>the day, and finish one Qur'an during the night. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) restrained him from <br>this excessive devotion and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger <br>or humour are actually not meant by him. You should <br>not write each and every thing spoken by him.' I ac- <br>cepted the advice. On my once mentioning this to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he said, 'You <br>keep doing as before. By Him who holds my life in His <br>hand, my lips do not utter anything except the truth, <br>even in anger or joy.\" <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"No one has narrated about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) more than me, except Abdullah bin <br>Amr. This is because he used to note down what he <br>heard, while I relied on my memory.\" <br>This is really wonderful, especially when we know that <br>most of his time was reading the Qur'an and other acts of <br>piety. <br>18. Zaid bin Thabit Memorises the Qur'an. <br>Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of those <br>eminent Sahabah who are considered to be most learned <br>and whose words in religious matters carry much weight. <br>He was an expert in regulations regarding obligatory prac- <br>tices. It is said that he was among the top ranking jurists, <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading. I desire you to learn the Jewish lan- <br>guage.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"In fifteen days, I mastered Hebrew and after that I <br>started doing all such correspondence for him.\" <br>According to another Hadith, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is reported to have similarly mastered the Syriac language <br>at the instance of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>He managed this within the short period of 17 days only. <br>19. Hasan's Knowledge of Islam. <br>The head of Sayyids, Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>born in Ramadhan, 3 A. H. He was thus a little over seven <br>years old at the time of the Prophet's death. In spite of his <br>tender age, quite a few Ahadith have been narrated by him. <br>Abul Howraa once asked him: <br>\"Do you remember any saying of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Yes. Once I was going with him. On the way I saw a <br>large quantity of dates of Sadaqah piled up at one <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah! Guide me along with those whom Thou <br>hast guided. Keep me in ease along with those whom <br>Thou hast kept in ease. Be my protecting friend along <br>with those whose protecting friend Thou has been. <br>Bless me in what Thou hast granted me. Grant me pro- <br>tection against the ill-effects of what may have been or- <br>dained for me, for Thy decision is final and nobody <br>can decide against Thy will. He who has Thee as the <br>protecting Friend cannot be abased. 0,Our Lord! Thou <br>art blessed and Thou art the Highest.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>\"The person who keeps sitting till sunrise at the place <br>where he said his Fajr prayers shall be saved from the <br>Hell.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) performed his Hajj many times <br>by covering the distance from Madinah to Mecca on foot <br>and, when asked about his reasons for undergoing such <br>hardships. he remarked: <br>\"I feel ashamed to face Allah (after my death) without <br>having gone to Mecca on foot for pilgrimage tp his <br>House.\" <br>Hasan is reputed for his piety and mildness. He is respon- <br>sible for narrating many Ahadith, collected by Imaam <br><br>Ahmad in his Musnad. The author of 'Talqih' has included <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) among those who have reported <br>as many as 13 Ahadith. To have remembered so many Aha- <br>dith at the age of 7 shows his devotion to Islam and his re- <br>markable memory. On the other hand, our children at this <br>age generally do not know even the elements of Islam. <br>20. \t Husain's Zeal for Knowledge. <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was one year junior to <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anha), his brother. He was a little over <br>6 at the time of the Prophet's death. Nothing much can be <br>expected from a child of this age, but there are quite a few <br>Ahadith narrated by Husain (Radhiyallaho anho). Muhad- <br>dithin count him among those Sahabah who are respon- <br>sible for giving us at least 8 Ahadith. <br>The following Ahadith are among those narrated by <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>1. \t \"Each time a person recites 'Inna-lillahi-wa-inna- <br>Ilaihi-raaji-oon' when he recalls or is otherwise re- <br>minded of an adversity previously met by him, he <br>receives a reward from Allah as good as he would <br>have had at the time of actual infliction.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"A Muslim gets immunity from drowning while <br>crossing a river if, at the time of embarking, he re- <br>cites: \". O <br>* 0 ! ;  <br>0 , .  <br>( t r \t y)wj jpJJJ d! kL>j G$+ <br>& <br>(In the name of Allah be its course and its moor- <br>ing. Lo! My Lord is, surely, most Forgiving, most <br>Merciful).\" <br>3. \t \"To shun vain things makes one a good Muslim.\" <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once asked Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) if he re-<br>membered any incident in the life of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'Yes. Once <br>managed to get on to a few dates lying near a window <br>and put one of them into my mouth. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) bade me take out and throw <br>away the date, as we (i.e. his family members) were not <br>permitted to eat anything from Sadaqah.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) had gone on foot 25 times <br>for pilgrimage to Mecca. He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here- <br>after. In childhood the memory is at its best. Anything <br>memorised at that time is seldom forgotten. If children are <br>made to memorise the Qur'an, they will be able to do so <br>very easily and quickly. I have heard very frequently from <br>the elderly ladies of my family and from my respected <br>father himself that he had memorised one fourth of the <br>thirtieth part of the Qur'an even before he was weaned, and <br>he had finished memorising the whole Qur'an and, on the <br>top of that, he had read a few standard books in Persian lit- <br>erature (the latter 6f his own accord) while he was only <br>seven. He once narrated to me: <br>\"When I had finished memorising the Qur'an, my <br>father required me to repeat (from memory) the full <br>Qur'an once daily, and permitted me to play for the <br>rest of the day. I used to sit on the roof of the house <br>(being summer) and start reciting the Qur'an just after <br>Fajr. I would finish the whole of it in about seven <br>hours. I then had my lunch. In the evening, I used to <br>have lessons in Persian, though it was not compulsory <br>for me. To this routine I stuck for full six months.\" <br>It is not an ordinary thing for a child of seven to recite <br>the Qur'an once daily for full six months, along with learn- <br><br>ing other things. As a result, he would never forget or <br>commit an error when reciting the Qur'an from memory. <br>Apparently, he earned his livelihood by trade in books. He <br>was found reciting the Qur'an with his lips, even when his <br>hands were engaged in his job. Sometimes he would even <br>teach the boys (who wanted to learn from him after the <br>school hours), while himself reciting the Qur'an and doing <br>his job. He thus attended to three things at a time. But his <br>way of teaching his students was different from that <br>adopted currently in the schools, where the entire burden <br>is on the teachers. He simply listened to the student <br>reading, translating and explaining the meaning. If the stu- <br>dent was correct, he simply said, \"'Go ahead,\" but if the <br>student made some error or needed some further explana- <br>tion, then he only would correct or explain as the gase <br>might be. Now, this story is not of ancient times; this has <br>happened only recently. It is therefore wrong to presume <br>jhat the Muslims of today, being of poor physical strength, <br>cannot try to follow the footsteps of their ancestors in <br>Islam. <br><br>CHAPTER XI1 <br>LOVE FOR THE PROPHET <br>What we have hitherto read about the achievement of <br>the Sahabah in their time was in fact the result of their love <br>for Allah and for His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Love, as a matter of fact, was a great dynamic force in the <br>Sahabah's career. It was this force that made them forego <br>their luxuries, forget their lives, give up all their desires for <br>wealth, ignore all afflictions, and have no fear of death <br>even. There is no room for any other consideration (except <br>that of beloved) in the heart saturated with love. May Allah <br>through His Grace grant us His own love and that of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), so that we may be <br>blessed with devotion in His worship and have sense of <br>comfort in all difficulties faced in His service. <br>1. Abu Bakr's [Radhiyallaho anho) Sufferings for Islam. <br>In the beginning, those who embraced Islam had to <br>keep their faith secret, as far as possible. As the Muslims <br>were being constantly persecuted by the Qureysh, even the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised all new con- <br>verts to practise Islam secretly, so that they might not have <br>to suffer at the hands of Qureysh. When, however, the <br>number of Muslims reached 39, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) made a suggestion for the open preaching and prac- <br>tising of Islam. ThepProphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>would not agree, but, when Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>insisted. he gave his consent and so all of them went to <br>Haram for Tabligh. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) began to <br>speak, and the Khutbah given by him was the first ever de- <br>livered in the annals of Islam. Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>i <br>the Prophet's uncle and the Chief of Martyrs embraced <br>k <br>Islam on that very day, while 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came into the Muslim fold on the third day of this address. <br>No sooner did Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) start speaking <br>I<br>than the idolaters and disbelievers from amongst the Qu- <br>reysh fell upon the Muslims from all sides. Despite the fact <br>that he was considered to be the noblest and most respect- <br>able of all the people in Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was beaten to such an extent that his nose and ears <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>241 4c <br>$2<br>and his entire face were besmeared with blood. He was <br>kicked. thrashed with shoes, trampled under feet and han- <br>8 1  <br>dled most roughly and savagely. He became unconscious <br>vlI g  <br>and half-dead; none hoped that he would ever survive this <br>brutal onslaught. Banu Teem, the people of his clan, came <br>and carried him to his house. They also announced in the <br>Haram that if Abu Bakr succumbed to the injuries, they <br>would in retaliation take the life of Utbah bin Rabee'ah, <br>who had taken the most active part in the attack. Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) remained unconscious the whole day. <br>People round him shouted his name again and again to <br>know if he was in senses, but he would not speak. Late in <br>the evening however he opened his eyes and showed signs <br>of consciousness. As soon as he was able to speak, he en- <br>quired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>The people were most disappointed with him and they <br>said: <br>\"How is it that, despite all this calamity and after vir- <br>tually remaining in the jaws of death all day long on <br>account of the Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as <br>soon as he has come back to consciousness he has <br>nothing else to talk about, but the Prophet himself.\" <br>They left Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), much disgusted at <br>his devotion for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while they were satisfied that he was out of danger. They <br>advised Umme Khair, his mother, to give him something to <br>eat. But least minding his food, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) would incessantly and impatiently ask his mother <br>the same question again and again i.e. <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>On her showing ignorance about the welfare of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), Abu Bakr entreated <br>her to go to Umme Jamil (Umar's sister) and find out from <br>her the latest news about the Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The mother could not refuse the request of her son <br>in this pitiable condition, and hurried to Umme Jamil's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) house to enquire about the welfare of <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Like,other Mus- <br>lims of that time, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallah anha) was also <br>keeping her faith secret. She therefore concealed her <br>Stories of the Scrhaabah <br>knowledge about the Prophet (SallalIaho alaihe wasallam), <br>saying: <br>\"Who is Muhammad and who is Abu Bakr? Why <br>should I know anything about them? I am however <br>sorry to learn about the condition of your son; if you <br>like, I can go with you to see him.\" <br>Umme Khair agreed and they both came to Abu Bakr. On <br>seeing Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in that miserable con- <br>dition, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) could not control <br>herself and began to cry, saying: <br>\"Woe to the ruffians for what they have done to a man <br>like Abu Bakr. May Allah punish them for their mis- <br>conduct.\" <br>Regardless of what Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) said, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had the same words on his <br>lips viz: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil (pointing towards Umme Khair): <br>\"Is it safe to say anything in her presence?\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"Do not worry about her. Tell me quickly <br>i <br>how is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil: \"He is quite well.\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: <br>\"Where is he at this moment.\" <br>Umme Jamil: \t \"Heis at Arqam's place.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"By Allah! I will not eat anything until I <br>have looked at him.\" <br>Now, his mother was very anxious to feed him. She <br>knew that when he had sworn by Allah he would not break <br>his oath and, therefore, would not eat under any circum- <br>stances. She therefore agreed to take him to Arqam's place. <br>She had to wait till the street was least-frequented by the <br>people and she was able to take him to that place unde- <br>tected by Qureysh. When they both reached Arqam's place, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and clung to him weeping profusely. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reciprocated, and all <br>the Muslims who were present there also began to weep <br><br>bitterly over the condition of Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) then iptroduced his <br>mother Umme Khair to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), saying: <br>\"She is my mother, 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for her <br>and induce her to accept Islam.\" <br>The prophet first prayed for her and then preached to her. <br>She accepted Islam there and then. <br>Many people can claim to be lovers while in ease and <br>comfort. But a lover is a real lover when he is able to prove <br>his love even in the tribulation and adversity. <br>2. \t<br>'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Grief at the Prophet's <br>Death. <br>None can deny the proverbial valour, courage and <br>strength of 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), over whose men- <br>tion, even after the lapse of 1400 years, hearts are struck <br>with awe and respect. Islam could not be professed and <br>preached openly before 'Umar's coming into its fold. As <br>soon as he embraced Islam, the Muslims started saying <br>Salaat in the Haram, as none could dare harm them with <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their side. Notwithstanding <br>all this, he could not bear the shock of the Prophet passing <br>away. So much so that he stood with sword in his hand, ut- <br>terly confused and bewildered, saying: <br>\"I shall behead the person who says that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has passed away. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has only gone to <br>visit his Lord, just as Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone <br>to Toor. He will shortly return and cut off the hands <br>and feet of those who were spreading the false news of <br>his death.\" <br>On the other hand, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>stunned with grief on this event. He could not utter a single <br>word, even till the next day, and walked about as if bereft <br>of speech. Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), too, was in terrible <br>grief. He was still and motionless. Only Abu Bakr, (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) for all his love of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as we have seen in the last story, stood <br>firm as a rock against this terrible storm of grief and did not <br>lose his mental composure. He calmly entered the Proph- <br>et's house, kissed his forehead and came back to the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>As Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was destined to be <br>the Khalifah after the Prophet, (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) <br>E<br>it is significa~t that, unlike other Sahabah, he behaved with <br>the composure and patience that were needed on an oc- <br>casion like this. Again. it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) alone who knew better than anybody else about the <br>regulations regarding the burial, inheritance, etc, of the <br>Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam). When difference of <br>opinion arose among the Sahabah whether the burial place <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) be at Mecca or <br>Madinah or jerusalenl, it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) who settled the difference by saying on the authority <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the Proph- <br>ets are buried where they have died. There were several <br>other Ahadith known only to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that helped solve many of the other problems arising <br>/<br>out of the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>t <br>lam). Some of these Ahadith were: \t<br>i <br>(1) \"Prophets have no heirs. All that a Prophet leaves <br>behind is Sadaqah.\" <br>i<br>(2) \t\"Allah's curse is on the Amir who does not take <br>proper interest and excercise proper care in the ap- <br>pointment of his deputies.\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was told that he was safe and sound, but she would not rest <br>contented, and insisted on seeing him herself. When at last <br>she had satisfied her eyes with his sight, she said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, every affliction is eased and every <br>worry removed with the blessing of seeing you.\" <br>According to another version, she herself clung to the <br>Prophet's robes and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to me than my par- <br>ents. The death of my kinsmen has lost all its sting for <br>me when I have seen you living.\" <br>There are several incidents of this kind that occurred <br>after the battle of Uhud. It is, perhaps, for the large number <br>of such incidents that different names have been reported <br>by different narrators about these women. In fact, such in- <br>cidents happened in large numbers with many women of <br>that time. <br>4. <br>The Behaviour of Sahabah at Hudeybiyah. <br>The campaign of Hudeybiyah took place in 6 A.H., <br>when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with a large <br>number of Sahabah was going to Mecca with the intention <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>otherwise not.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to the pro- <br>posal of ~ b b  <br>to<br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and decided <br>march ahead towards Mecca. When he reached Hudey- <br>biyah, Budail bin Waraqa Khuza'i met him with a group of <br>! <br>people. He said: <br>\"The Qureysh uncler no circumstances will permit <br>i <br>your entry intb Mecca. They are already drawn up in <br>battle array.\" <br>At this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>I <br>\"We have come to perform 'Umrah only and have no <br>intention to fight. Frequent battles have already inflic- <br>ted heavy casualties on Qureysh. If, therefore, they <br>agree, I am prepared to talk over a no-war pact with <br>them, so that they do not fight with me and I may deal <br>with others. If, however, Qureysh do not see their way <br>to accepting this proposal, then by Him who holds my <br>i<br>life in His hand, I will fight them till at last either <br>i<br>Islam prevails or I am slain.\" <br>I <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah: <br>\"Go and faun upon your goddess 'Lat'! We will by no <br>means flee away and leave the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) by himself.\" <br>'Urwah asked: \"Who is he?\" <br>The Prophet: <br>'Urwah: <br>\"He is Abu Bakr.\" <br>\"Abu Bakr! I am in<br>turn you have done <br>for this, I would <br>abuse.\" <br>debted <br>to m<br>have <br>to you f<br>replied <br>e in the <br>or a <br>to <br>good <br>past. But <br>your <br>'Urwah then resumed his deliberations with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). 'Urwah occasionally touched <br>the beard of the Prophet (according to the Arab custom) as <br>he talked. The Sahabah could not tolerate this. Accord- <br>ingly, 'Urwah's own nephew Mughirah bin Shu'bah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was standing armed near by, struck <br>Urwah's hand with the handle of his sword and said: <br>\"Keep your hand away.\" <br>'Urwah: <br>\"Who is he?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the <br>ground arid anoint their faces with it. Hardly a word <br>escapes his lips before all of them run to carry out his <br>wish. When he makes Wudhu, they fight with one an- <br>other to collect some drop of the used water before it <br>t <br>falls on the ground. If any one fails to get that water. he <br>touches the wet hands of the persori who had got it <br>arid then rubs his own hands on the face. When they <br>speak in his presence, they speak in low voice. They <br>I <br>do not lift their gaze to look at his face, out of respect <br>! <br>for him. A hair falling from his head or beard is pre- <br>served to get benediction from it arid is looked upon as <br>i<br>a sacred relic. In short, I have never seen any group of <br>people so devoted to their master as I have seen the <br>companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) towards him.\" <br>At long last, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was commis- <br>sioned by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to nego- <br>tiate with the Qureysh, as he, in spite of his conversion to <br>Islam, commanded respect with them. When 'Usman (Rad- <br>hivallaho anho) had left for Mecca, some of the Sahabah <br>envied Usman's luck in (as they thought) being able to per- <br>form l'awaf of the house of Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on the other hand remarked: <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>249 s= <br>a\"\" <br>o a  <br>\"I do not think he will ever like to do 'l'awaf without <br>me.\" <br>However when 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) entered <br>Mecca, Abaan bi'il Sa'eed took him in his protection and <br>said to him: <br>.:$<br>Svl<br>fa <br>\"You roam where you like. Nobody car1 touch vou.\" <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) carried 011 his negotiations <br>with Abu Sufyan and other chiefs of Mecca on behalf of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and, when he was <br>about to return, the Qureysh the~nselves said to him: <br>\"Now when vou are here at Mecca, you can perforin <br>Tawaf before you return.\" <br>He replied: \"How can it be possible for me when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihc wasailam) has been <br>prevented by you <br>people from ellterilig <br>Mecca.\" <br>This reply was nlost unpalatable for the Qureysh and they <br>decided to detain 'Usman (Kadhivallaho anho) at Mecca. A <br>news reached the Muslims that 'Usnlan (Kadhiyallilho <br>aliho) had been martyred. On this news reaching the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he took the oath of al- <br>legiance from all Sahabah ta fight to the litst drop of their <br>blood. When the Qureysh learnt of this, they got frighteried <br>and imrnediatelv released 'Usrnan (liadhiyallaho anho). <br>In this story, Abu 13akr's (liadhivallaho anho) insultitlg <br>'Urrvah. Mughirah's (Kadhiyallaho anho) treatment of his <br>uncle, the Sahabah's behaviour to\\vards the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe ~lasallanl) as evidenc:ed by 'IJrwiih. and <br>'IJsman's (Kacllii~~allaho <br>anho) refusing to do 'Tawiif '. all <br>speak volumes. aboi~t the love and devotioll of Sahabah for <br>the Prol~het (Sallallnho alaihe wasallam). Tile oath of nlle- <br>giance mentioned in this story is known Bai'atush Shajarah <br>(The Oath of a1 legiance beneath the tree) and is mentioned <br>in the Quran (XLVIII: 18). <br>5. <br>Ibn Zubair's (~adhi~all'aho <br>anho) disposal of blood. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>bled by cupping. The blood was given to Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) to bury it somewhere. He re-<br>turned ant1 informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>lam) that the blood had been disposed of. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves. <br>6. \t Abu 'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) loses His Teeth. <br>During the battle of Uhud, when at one time the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was fiercely attacked <br>by the enemy and two links of the helmet worn by him <br>were struck deep into his head (or face). Abu Bakr and Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) ran to help him. Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) started pulling out the links <br>with his teeth. By the time one of the links was out, he had <br>lost one of his teeth. Without minding this, he again used <br>his teeth to pull up the other link as well. He succeeded in <br>taking out that one too, but he had to lose another tooth in <br>the effort. When the links were drawn out, the blood began <br>to ooze out from the Prophet's body. Malik bin Sinaan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the father of Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), licked the blood with his lips. At this, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The fire of Hell cannot touch the person who has my <br>blood mixed with his.\" <br>7. \t Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) Refuses to Go With His <br>Father. <br>Once in pre-Islam days, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br><br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory. <br>Alas, my lengthening grief and unending distress.\" <br>\"I shall run my swift camels in search of him. I shall <br>search for him round the universe.\" <br>\"The camels may get tired, but I shall not rest, till I <br>die, for death is the end of every hope.\" <br>\"I shall still enjoin on my sons and such and such <br>people, to keep searching for Zaid even after my <br>death.\" <br>.Some people of his clan happened to meet Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) during their pilgrimage to Mecca. They re- <br>lated to him the story of his father's grief and anguish, and <br>recited to him the couplets which he sang in his memory. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) sent a letter to his father through <br>these people. The letter consisted of three couplets ad- <br>dressed to his father assuring him that he was quite well <br>and happy in the present environments with his noble <br>master. When the people went back, they informed his <br>father of his whereabouts and delivered him Zaid's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) message. On receiving the letter, his father <br>and his uncle left for Mecca with sufficient money to <br>ransom Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho). When they came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) they said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Yes, I know them. This is my father and <br>that is my uncl'e.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"And you know me too. They have come to <br>take you back to your home. You have my <br>full permission to go with them. If, on the <br>other hand, you chose to stay on with me, <br>you shall have your choice.\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"How can I prefer anybody else to you? You <br>are everybody for me, including my father <br>and my uncle.\" <br>Zaid's father and uncle: <br>\"0.Zaid! Do you prefer to be a slave? How can you <br>leave your own father, uncle and other members of <br>your family, and remain a bondsman?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Verily, I have seen something in my master <br>that makes me prefer him to everybody else <br>in the world.\" <br>On this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) took Zaid <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) in his lap and said: <br>\"From today, I adopt Zaid as my son.\" <br><br>The father and uncle were quite satisfied with the situation <br>and gladly left Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and returned without him. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was only a child at that time. <br>His preferring to remain a slave, and refusing to go with his <br>own father giving up his home and kith and kin is an ob- <br>vious tribute to his love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). <br>8. \t<br>Anas bin Nadhr's (Radhiyallaho anho) Martyrdom in <br>Uhud. <br>When the Muslims were facing defeat in Uhud, some- <br>body started the rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had been killed. You can imagine the Sahabah's <br>grief and anguish over this tragic news. This, quite natu- <br>rally, caused most of them to lose heart in despair. Anas <br>bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to see 'Umar and <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) with a group of Muslims in <br>a state of utter bewilderment. He said to them: <br>\"Why am I seeing you all so bewildered?\" <br>They said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is slain.\" <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>\"Then who will like to live after him? Come, let us go <br>forward with our swords and join o,ur dear Prophet.\" <br>No sooner did he utter these words than hr plunged <br>into the enemy lines and fought till he was martyred. <br>In fact, Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had such an extreme <br>love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he <br>did not consider this life worth living without him. <br>9. \t<br>Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) Message For The Muslims. <br>During the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What about Sa'd bin Rabee'? I don't know how things <br>have gone with him.\" <br>One of the Sahabah was despatched to search for him. He <br>went to the spot where the bodies of martyrs lay in heaps. <br>He shouted Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) name to know if he</p></div>"

At one place, while he was announcing that he <br>was deputed by the Prophet to enquire about Sa'd bin <br>Rabee' (Radhiyallaho anho), he heard a feeble'voice coming <br>from one direction. He turned to that direction and found <br>that Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was lying among the killed <br>and was about to breathe his last. Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was heard saying: <br>\"Convey my Salaam to the Prophet with my message, <br>'0Prophet of Allah! May Allah grant you on my behalf <br>a reward more exalted and more handsome than the <br>one Allah has ever granted a Prophet on behalf of any <br>of his followers, and tell my Muslim brothers, 'Nothing <br>will absolve you from blame, on the Day of Judgement, <br>if the enemy succeeds in reaching the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) before all of you have fallen.\" <br>With these words, Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) drew his last <br>breath and passed into the presence of Allah. <br>As a matter of fact, the Sahabah have given a true proof <br>of their devotion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). While they suffered wound after wound and were on <br>their last breath, they had no complaint nor wish on their <br>lips and could not think of anything else except about the <br>safety and welfare of the Prophet. Would that a sinner like <br>me be blessed with an atom of the love that the Sahabah <br>bore for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>10.

The woman on seeing the grave <br>started crying in love and memory of the Prophet. In fact <br>she wept so bitterly and incessantly that she swooned and <br>expired there and then (May Allah bless her).

Let me have one hundred men, I <br>shall teach them a lesson.\" <br>But the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"No. They would have by now reached their bases.\" <br>Most of the historians say that Salmah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>was hardly 12 or 13 at that time. Look how a boy of such a <br>small age was able to chase so many bandits single-handed. <br>He recovered all the plunder and besides took a consider- <br>able booty from them. This was the outcome of Iman and <br>Ikhlas, with which Allah had imbued the hearts of those <br>blessed people. <br>10. \t Hadhrat Bara's (Radhiyallaho anho) eagerness to Join <br>in Badr. <br>Badr was the most gallant and illustrious battle ever <br>fought by the Muslims, who were faced with very heavy <br>odds. There were 313 men, 3 horses, seventy camels, six or <br>nine coats of arms and eight swords with the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), while the Qureysh had about <br>1000 men, 100 horses, 700 camels, and were armed to their <br>teeth. The Qureysh were so sure of their victory that they <br>had brought with them musical instruments and song-<br>stresses to celebrate the victory. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was very anxious because of the heavy <br>odds against him. Heprayed to Allah saying: <br>\"0,Allah! Thy faithful slaves are barefooted; Thou and <br>only Thou can provide them with animals to ride <br>upon. They are naked; Thou and only Thou can clothe <br>them. They are poor; Thou and only Thou can sustain <br>them.\" <br>Allah granted his prayer and gave the most glorious victory <br>to the Muslims. <br>In spite of knowing the strength of the Qureysh, Ab- <br>dullah bin 'Umar and Bara bin Azib (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma), in eagerness to join the battle, had come out with <br>the Mujahidin. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>however, in consideration of their tender age, did not <br>permit them to proceed to the battle-field. <br><br>As we have already seen, both these boys were also re- <br>jected for the same reason at the time of Uhud, which took <br>place one year after Badr. Look at the wonderful spirit of <br>the youngsters of that time that they were anxious to obtain <br>permission for participating in every battle. <br>11. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubayy (Radhiyal-<br>laho anha) disgraces his Munafiq Father <br>During the famous campaign of Banul Mustaliq in 5 A. <br>H., a Muhajir had a strife with Ansari over some trifling <br>matter. Each of them called his own people for help, and <br>there was a serious danger of a fight among the two groups <br>of the Muslims but, through the efforts of some sane <br>paople, this was averted. Abdullah bin Ubayy was the chief <br>of Munafiqin. He was a very bitter enemy of Islam. As he <br>posed to be a Muslim, he was treated as such by the other <br>Muslims. When he came to know of this incident, he used <br>some insolent words for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and, exploiting the situation, addressed his people <br>thus: <br>\"All this is the outcome of the seed that you people <br>have sown with your own hands. You provided refuge <br>to these strangers (meaning Muhajirin) in your town <br>and shared your wealth equally with them. If you <br>withdraw your help from them, they will be obliged to <br>go back.\" <br>He further said: <br>\"By Allah! On return to Madinah, we, the respected <br>people, shall drive out these mean people from there.\" <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho), an Ansari <br>boy was listening to him. He could not tolerate these words <br>and at once retorted by saying to him: <br>\"By Allah! You yourself are wretched. Even your own <br>people look down upon you, and nobody will support <br>you. Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>honoured. He is exalted by Rahman and revered by his <br>followers.\" <br>Abdullah bin Ubayy said: <br>\"All right. Do not mention it to anybody. It was only a <br>jest; I was not serious in w h t  I said.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) however went straight to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and narrated to <br>him what the Munafiq had said. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) sought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>permission to kill Abdullah bin Ubayy, but the Prophet re- <br>fused. When Abdullah bin Ubayy learnt that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had received the report about <br>his insolent talk, he came to him and swore by Allah <br>saying: <br>\"I never said such a thing. Zaid is a liar; he has given <br>you false report.\" <br>A few of the Ansars were also sitting with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They also pleaded his case by <br>saying: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! He is chief of his clan and is a <br>big man. His statement is more reliable than the report <br>by a mere boy. It is just possible that Zaid might have <br>misheard or misunderstood him.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted his <br>statement and took no action against him. When Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) came to know that the Munafiq had suc- <br>ceeded in , beguiling the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) through false oaths, he would not come out for <br>shame of being considered a liar by the people. He would <br>not even go to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At <br>last, Allah revealed Soorah A1 Munafiqoon, in which the <br>report of Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was confirmed and the <br>Munafiq was exposed. After this, all people began to <br>honour Zaid and look down upon the Munafiq. <br>Now the Munafiq (Abdullah bin Ubayy) had a son. His <br>name was also Abdullah and he was a very sincere <br>Muslim. When the Mujahidin were about to reach Madi- <br>nah, he drew out his sword and stood just outside the town <br>and, in a challenging tone, said to his Munafiq father: <br>\"I will not allow you to enter Madinah, until you <br>admit with your own tongue that it is you who is mean <br>and Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is most <br>exalted.\" <br>This surprised him very much, as the son had always been <br>very respectful to kim, but now he was prepared to kill <br>him, his own father, for the honour of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). The Munafiq had to declare: <br><br>0)<br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>229 3% <br>L.0 4 <br>\"By Allah! I am mean, and Muhammad (Sallallaho 8 g  <br>alaihe wasallam) is most exalted.\" <br>2;<br>G <br>He was then allowed to enter the town. <br>12. Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) Eagerness to <br>Fight. <br>When the battle of Uhud was over, the remnant of Sa- <br>habah returned to Madinah, most tired and broken. When <br>the Qureysh, on their way back to Mecca, were camping at <br>a place called Hamra-ul Asad, their chief, Abu Sufyan, sat <br>in council with his lieutenants. They said among them- <br>selves: <br>\"The Muslims are defeated in Uhud. Their morale <br>must be very low. This is the best time to finish Mu- <br>hammad.\" <br>They, therefore, decided to return and attack Madinah. <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) received in- <br>telligence about this council, he ordered all those Sahabah <br>who had participated in Uhud, and who had just returned <br>from the battle, to move out of Madinah and meet the <br>enemy on the way. <br>Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I was very eager to fight in Uhud, <br>but my father prevented me from going, on the plea <br>that there was no other member in the house to look <br>after my seven sisters and only one of us could join the <br>campaign. As he had made up his mind to go, he bade <br>me stay back with the family. He met the most coveted <br>end [i.e., martyrdom) in Uhud. Now I am very eager to <br>go with you this time and fight the Qureysh.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) allowed him to <br>go. He was the only person in that campaign who had not <br>fought in Uhud. <br>Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) father was mar-<br>tyred in Uhud. He left Jabir a big family to look after and <br>large debts to clear, with nothing to live on. The debts were <br>due to one of the Jews, who as we know seldom have any <br>soft corner in their hearts for their debtors. Also his seven <br>sisters for whose sake he was not allowed to go to Uhud- <br>were still there to be boked after. Now look! inspite of all <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage, 100 000 dinars in prize, and also <br>governorship over the area now ruled by him.\" <br>The fighi was very tough and went on for a long time. <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) succeeded in spotting <br>Jarjir seated behind his forces, under an umbrella of <br>peacock feathers held by two maids. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), all at once, outskirted the Roman <br>troops and approached him. He attacked Jarjir with his <br>sword and severed his head from his body. He then <br>fixed the head oh the point of his spear and returned to <br>his camp, to the utter amazement of both the armies at <br>his matchless valour. <br>When the Sahabah emigrated to Madinah, no son was <br>borne to any of the emigrants for one year after the emigra- <br>tion. The Jews of Madinah said: <br>\"We have cast a spell on the emigrants. They cannot <br>have male issue.\" <br>Abdullah 'bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was the first <br>male child born to the Muhajirin. The Muslims were, natu- <br>rally, very happy over his birth. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not generally allow the children to <br>take oath of allegiance to him. But Abdullah bin Zubair <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>231 gz <br>Gm;g<br>a <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had the honour of pledging allegiance .=+<br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) when he was <br>g m<br>* <br>only seven. During this battle, he was barely in his early <br>twenties. To go single-handed and kill the commander, <br>after hoodwinking his army of 200 000 men, at this age is <br>really marvellous. <br>14. \t Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) Leads <br>in Salaat. <br>Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We lived with our father at a place on the caravan <br>route to Madinah. When a caravan from Madinah <br>passed our village, we asked the people therein about <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They would <br>tell us that he claimed to be receiving revelations from <br>Allah, and they would also recite a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before us to give us an idea about his claim. <br>Then I immediately used to commit those verses to <br>memory. In this way, I remembered a good portion of <br>the Qur'an, even before I embraced Islam. All the <br>desert tribes were waiting for Mecca to fall to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) before they em- <br>braced Islam. On his victorious entry into Mecca, <br>deputations from all the tribes began to come to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in order to accept <br>Islam. My father headed the group who went to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pledge alle- <br>giance to him on behalf of our tribe. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) taught them the basic <br>regulations about Salaat and other Islamic practices. <br>He said to them, \"The person who knows more Qur'an <br>is entitled to lead in Salaat. Now it so happened that <br>none in my tribe knew so much Qur'an as I did. They <br>searched for an Imam, but they could not find a person <br>knowing more Qur'an than me. I was, therefore, made <br>Imam. At that time, I was only seven. I led the congre; <br>gational Salaat and funeral service if any.\" <br>It was his natural inclination and affinity towards Islam <br>that made him remember so much of the Qur'an when he <br>was only a boy and he had not even embraced Islam. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) used <br>to say to the people: <br>\"Come to me for your difficulties in understanding the <br>Qur'an. I memorised it while I was only a child.\" <br>In another Hadith, he is reported to have said: <br>\"I had completed my reading of the Qur'an when I'was <br>only ten.\" <br>r <br>The reading of the Qur'an by Sahabah was not done <br>like the reading by the non-Arabs of today. Whatever they <br>read, they read with full meaning and explanation. As the <br>impression of something memorised in childhood is very <br>deep and permanent, so Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is accepted as Imam in Tafsir. None of the Sahabah <br>has narrated more Ahadith explaining the meaning of <br>Qur'an than was done by Ibn Abbas. Abdullah bin Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is the best <br>commentator of the Qur'an.\" <br>Abu Abdur Rahman (Rahmatullah alaih), on the authority <br>of Sahabah who taught him the Qur'an, says: <br><br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was saying his Salaat. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>joined him in Salaat by standing behind him. The Prophet <br>caught him by the hand and drew him to his side. (When <br>there is only one follower in Salaat with Jamaat, he stands <br>by the side of Imam and not after him). While the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was busy in Salaat, he moved <br>back a little distance. When the Salaat was over, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him: <br>\"What made you recede from your place?\" <br>Hesaid: \t \"You are the Prophet of Allah!. How could I <br>stand with you.\" <br>On this occasion too, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) prayed for his knowledge and understanding. <br>17. \t ~ b d u l l a hbin Amr bin Aas Notes Down Ahadith: <br>Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>one of the most pious Sahabah. Daily he used to fast during <br>the day, and finish one Qur'an during the night. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) restrained him from <br>this excessive devotion and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger <br>or humour are actually not meant by him. You should <br>not write each and every thing spoken by him.' I ac- <br>cepted the advice. On my once mentioning this to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he said, 'You <br>keep doing as before. By Him who holds my life in His <br>hand, my lips do not utter anything except the truth, <br>even in anger or joy.\" <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"No one has narrated about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) more than me, except Abdullah bin <br>Amr. This is because he used to note down what he <br>heard, while I relied on my memory.\" <br>This is really wonderful, especially when we know that <br>most of his time was reading the Qur'an and other acts of <br>piety. <br>18. Zaid bin Thabit Memorises the Qur'an. <br>Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of those <br>eminent Sahabah who are considered to be most learned <br>and whose words in religious matters carry much weight. <br>He was an expert in regulations regarding obligatory prac- <br>tices. It is said that he was among the top ranking jurists, <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading. I desire you to learn the Jewish lan- <br>guage.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"In fifteen days, I mastered Hebrew and after that I <br>started doing all such correspondence for him.\" <br>According to another Hadith, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is reported to have similarly mastered the Syriac language <br>at the instance of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>He managed this within the short period of 17 days only. <br>19. Hasan's Knowledge of Islam. <br>The head of Sayyids, Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>born in Ramadhan, 3 A. H. He was thus a little over seven <br>years old at the time of the Prophet's death. In spite of his <br>tender age, quite a few Ahadith have been narrated by him. <br>Abul Howraa once asked him: <br>\"Do you remember any saying of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Yes. Once I was going with him. On the way I saw a <br>large quantity of dates of Sadaqah piled up at one <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah! Guide me along with those whom Thou <br>hast guided. Keep me in ease along with those whom <br>Thou hast kept in ease. Be my protecting friend along <br>with those whose protecting friend Thou has been. <br>Bless me in what Thou hast granted me. Grant me pro- <br>tection against the ill-effects of what may have been or- <br>dained for me, for Thy decision is final and nobody <br>can decide against Thy will. He who has Thee as the <br>protecting Friend cannot be abased. 0,Our Lord! Thou <br>art blessed and Thou art the Highest.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>\"The person who keeps sitting till sunrise at the place <br>where he said his Fajr prayers shall be saved from the <br>Hell.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) performed his Hajj many times <br>by covering the distance from Madinah to Mecca on foot <br>and, when asked about his reasons for undergoing such <br>hardships. he remarked: <br>\"I feel ashamed to face Allah (after my death) without <br>having gone to Mecca on foot for pilgrimage tp his <br>House.\" <br>Hasan is reputed for his piety and mildness. He is respon- <br>sible for narrating many Ahadith, collected by Imaam <br><br>Ahmad in his Musnad. The author of 'Talqih' has included <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) among those who have reported <br>as many as 13 Ahadith. To have remembered so many Aha- <br>dith at the age of 7 shows his devotion to Islam and his re- <br>markable memory. On the other hand, our children at this <br>age generally do not know even the elements of Islam. <br>20. \t Husain's Zeal for Knowledge. <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was one year junior to <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anha), his brother. He was a little over <br>6 at the time of the Prophet's death. Nothing much can be <br>expected from a child of this age, but there are quite a few <br>Ahadith narrated by Husain (Radhiyallaho anho). Muhad- <br>dithin count him among those Sahabah who are respon- <br>sible for giving us at least 8 Ahadith. <br>The following Ahadith are among those narrated by <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>1. \t \"Each time a person recites 'Inna-lillahi-wa-inna- <br>Ilaihi-raaji-oon' when he recalls or is otherwise re- <br>minded of an adversity previously met by him, he <br>receives a reward from Allah as good as he would <br>have had at the time of actual infliction.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"A Muslim gets immunity from drowning while <br>crossing a river if, at the time of embarking, he re- <br>cites: \". O <br>* 0 ! ;  <br>0 , .  <br>( t r \t y)wj jpJJJ d! kL>j G$+ <br>& <br>(In the name of Allah be its course and its moor- <br>ing. Lo! My Lord is, surely, most Forgiving, most <br>Merciful).\" <br>3. \t \"To shun vain things makes one a good Muslim.\" <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once asked Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) if he re-<br>membered any incident in the life of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'Yes. Once <br>managed to get on to a few dates lying near a window <br>and put one of them into my mouth. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) bade me take out and throw <br>away the date, as we (i.e. his family members) were not <br>permitted to eat anything from Sadaqah.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) had gone on foot 25 times <br>for pilgrimage to Mecca. He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here- <br>after. In childhood the memory is at its best. Anything <br>memorised at that time is seldom forgotten. If children are <br>made to memorise the Qur'an, they will be able to do so <br>very easily and quickly. I have heard very frequently from <br>the elderly ladies of my family and from my respected <br>father himself that he had memorised one fourth of the <br>thirtieth part of the Qur'an even before he was weaned, and <br>he had finished memorising the whole Qur'an and, on the <br>top of that, he had read a few standard books in Persian lit- <br>erature (the latter 6f his own accord) while he was only <br>seven. He once narrated to me: <br>\"When I had finished memorising the Qur'an, my <br>father required me to repeat (from memory) the full <br>Qur'an once daily, and permitted me to play for the <br>rest of the day. I used to sit on the roof of the house <br>(being summer) and start reciting the Qur'an just after <br>Fajr. I would finish the whole of it in about seven <br>hours. I then had my lunch. In the evening, I used to <br>have lessons in Persian, though it was not compulsory <br>for me. To this routine I stuck for full six months.\" <br>It is not an ordinary thing for a child of seven to recite <br>the Qur'an once daily for full six months, along with learn- <br><br>ing other things. As a result, he would never forget or <br>commit an error when reciting the Qur'an from memory. <br>Apparently, he earned his livelihood by trade in books. He <br>was found reciting the Qur'an with his lips, even when his <br>hands were engaged in his job. Sometimes he would even <br>teach the boys (who wanted to learn from him after the <br>school hours), while himself reciting the Qur'an and doing <br>his job. He thus attended to three things at a time. But his <br>way of teaching his students was different from that <br>adopted currently in the schools, where the entire burden <br>is on the teachers. He simply listened to the student <br>reading, translating and explaining the meaning. If the stu- <br>dent was correct, he simply said, \"'Go ahead,\" but if the <br>student made some error or needed some further explana- <br>tion, then he only would correct or explain as the gase <br>might be. Now, this story is not of ancient times; this has <br>happened only recently. It is therefore wrong to presume <br>jhat the Muslims of today, being of poor physical strength, <br>cannot try to follow the footsteps of their ancestors in <br>Islam. <br><br>CHAPTER XI1 <br>LOVE FOR THE PROPHET <br>What we have hitherto read about the achievement of <br>the Sahabah in their time was in fact the result of their love <br>for Allah and for His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Love, as a matter of fact, was a great dynamic force in the <br>Sahabah's career. It was this force that made them forego <br>their luxuries, forget their lives, give up all their desires for <br>wealth, ignore all afflictions, and have no fear of death <br>even. There is no room for any other consideration (except <br>that of beloved) in the heart saturated with love. May Allah <br>through His Grace grant us His own love and that of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), so that we may be <br>blessed with devotion in His worship and have sense of <br>comfort in all difficulties faced in His service. <br>1. Abu Bakr's [Radhiyallaho anho) Sufferings for Islam. <br>In the beginning, those who embraced Islam had to <br>keep their faith secret, as far as possible. As the Muslims <br>were being constantly persecuted by the Qureysh, even the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised all new con- <br>verts to practise Islam secretly, so that they might not have <br>to suffer at the hands of Qureysh. When, however, the <br>number of Muslims reached 39, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) made a suggestion for the open preaching and prac- <br>tising of Islam. ThepProphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>would not agree, but, when Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>insisted. he gave his consent and so all of them went to <br>Haram for Tabligh. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) began to <br>speak, and the Khutbah given by him was the first ever de- <br>livered in the annals of Islam. Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>i <br>the Prophet's uncle and the Chief of Martyrs embraced <br>k <br>Islam on that very day, while 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came into the Muslim fold on the third day of this address. <br>No sooner did Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) start speaking <br>I<br>than the idolaters and disbelievers from amongst the Qu- <br>reysh fell upon the Muslims from all sides. Despite the fact <br>that he was considered to be the noblest and most respect- <br>able of all the people in Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was beaten to such an extent that his nose and ears <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>241 4c <br>$2<br>and his entire face were besmeared with blood. He was <br>kicked. thrashed with shoes, trampled under feet and han- <br>8 1  <br>dled most roughly and savagely. He became unconscious <br>vlI g  <br>and half-dead; none hoped that he would ever survive this <br>brutal onslaught. Banu Teem, the people of his clan, came <br>and carried him to his house. They also announced in the <br>Haram that if Abu Bakr succumbed to the injuries, they <br>would in retaliation take the life of Utbah bin Rabee'ah, <br>who had taken the most active part in the attack. Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) remained unconscious the whole day. <br>People round him shouted his name again and again to <br>know if he was in senses, but he would not speak. Late in <br>the evening however he opened his eyes and showed signs <br>of consciousness. As soon as he was able to speak, he en- <br>quired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>The people were most disappointed with him and they <br>said: <br>\"How is it that, despite all this calamity and after vir- <br>tually remaining in the jaws of death all day long on <br>account of the Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as <br>soon as he has come back to consciousness he has <br>nothing else to talk about, but the Prophet himself.\" <br>They left Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), much disgusted at <br>his devotion for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while they were satisfied that he was out of danger. They <br>advised Umme Khair, his mother, to give him something to <br>eat. But least minding his food, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) would incessantly and impatiently ask his mother <br>the same question again and again i.e. <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>On her showing ignorance about the welfare of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), Abu Bakr entreated <br>her to go to Umme Jamil (Umar's sister) and find out from <br>her the latest news about the Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The mother could not refuse the request of her son <br>in this pitiable condition, and hurried to Umme Jamil's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) house to enquire about the welfare of <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Like,other Mus- <br>lims of that time, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallah anha) was also <br>keeping her faith secret. She therefore concealed her <br>Stories of the Scrhaabah <br>knowledge about the Prophet (SallalIaho alaihe wasallam), <br>saying: <br>\"Who is Muhammad and who is Abu Bakr? Why <br>should I know anything about them? I am however <br>sorry to learn about the condition of your son; if you <br>like, I can go with you to see him.\" <br>Umme Khair agreed and they both came to Abu Bakr. On <br>seeing Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in that miserable con- <br>dition, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) could not control <br>herself and began to cry, saying: <br>\"Woe to the ruffians for what they have done to a man <br>like Abu Bakr. May Allah punish them for their mis- <br>conduct.\" <br>Regardless of what Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) said, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had the same words on his <br>lips viz: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil (pointing towards Umme Khair): <br>\"Is it safe to say anything in her presence?\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"Do not worry about her. Tell me quickly <br>i <br>how is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil: \"He is quite well.\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: <br>\"Where is he at this moment.\" <br>Umme Jamil: \t \"Heis at Arqam's place.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"By Allah! I will not eat anything until I <br>have looked at him.\" <br>Now, his mother was very anxious to feed him. She <br>knew that when he had sworn by Allah he would not break <br>his oath and, therefore, would not eat under any circum- <br>stances. She therefore agreed to take him to Arqam's place. <br>She had to wait till the street was least-frequented by the <br>people and she was able to take him to that place unde- <br>tected by Qureysh. When they both reached Arqam's place, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and clung to him weeping profusely. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reciprocated, and all <br>the Muslims who were present there also began to weep <br><br>bitterly over the condition of Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) then iptroduced his <br>mother Umme Khair to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), saying: <br>\"She is my mother, 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for her <br>and induce her to accept Islam.\" <br>The prophet first prayed for her and then preached to her. <br>She accepted Islam there and then. <br>Many people can claim to be lovers while in ease and <br>comfort. But a lover is a real lover when he is able to prove <br>his love even in the tribulation and adversity. <br>2. \t<br>'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Grief at the Prophet's <br>Death. <br>None can deny the proverbial valour, courage and <br>strength of 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), over whose men- <br>tion, even after the lapse of 1400 years, hearts are struck <br>with awe and respect. Islam could not be professed and <br>preached openly before 'Umar's coming into its fold. As <br>soon as he embraced Islam, the Muslims started saying <br>Salaat in the Haram, as none could dare harm them with <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their side. Notwithstanding <br>all this, he could not bear the shock of the Prophet passing <br>away. So much so that he stood with sword in his hand, ut- <br>terly confused and bewildered, saying: <br>\"I shall behead the person who says that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has passed away. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has only gone to <br>visit his Lord, just as Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone <br>to Toor. He will shortly return and cut off the hands <br>and feet of those who were spreading the false news of <br>his death.\" <br>On the other hand, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>stunned with grief on this event. He could not utter a single <br>word, even till the next day, and walked about as if bereft <br>of speech. Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), too, was in terrible <br>grief. He was still and motionless. Only Abu Bakr, (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) for all his love of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as we have seen in the last story, stood <br>firm as a rock against this terrible storm of grief and did not <br>lose his mental composure. He calmly entered the Proph- <br>et's house, kissed his forehead and came back to the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>As Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was destined to be <br>the Khalifah after the Prophet, (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) <br>E<br>it is significa~t that, unlike other Sahabah, he behaved with <br>the composure and patience that were needed on an oc- <br>casion like this. Again. it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) alone who knew better than anybody else about the <br>regulations regarding the burial, inheritance, etc, of the <br>Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam). When difference of <br>opinion arose among the Sahabah whether the burial place <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) be at Mecca or <br>Madinah or jerusalenl, it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) who settled the difference by saying on the authority <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the Proph- <br>ets are buried where they have died. There were several <br>other Ahadith known only to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that helped solve many of the other problems arising <br>/<br>out of the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>t <br>lam). Some of these Ahadith were: \t<br>i <br>(1) \"Prophets have no heirs. All that a Prophet leaves <br>behind is Sadaqah.\" <br>i<br>(2) \t\"Allah's curse is on the Amir who does not take <br>proper interest and excercise proper care in the ap- <br>pointment of his deputies.\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was told that he was safe and sound, but she would not rest <br>contented, and insisted on seeing him herself. When at last <br>she had satisfied her eyes with his sight, she said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, every affliction is eased and every <br>worry removed with the blessing of seeing you.\" <br>According to another version, she herself clung to the <br>Prophet's robes and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to me than my par- <br>ents. The death of my kinsmen has lost all its sting for <br>me when I have seen you living.\" <br>There are several incidents of this kind that occurred <br>after the battle of Uhud. It is, perhaps, for the large number <br>of such incidents that different names have been reported <br>by different narrators about these women. In fact, such in- <br>cidents happened in large numbers with many women of <br>that time. <br>4. <br>The Behaviour of Sahabah at Hudeybiyah. <br>The campaign of Hudeybiyah took place in 6 A.H., <br>when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with a large <br>number of Sahabah was going to Mecca with the intention <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>otherwise not.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to the pro- <br>posal of ~ b b  <br>to<br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and decided <br>march ahead towards Mecca. When he reached Hudey- <br>biyah, Budail bin Waraqa Khuza'i met him with a group of <br>! <br>people. He said: <br>\"The Qureysh uncler no circumstances will permit <br>i <br>your entry intb Mecca. They are already drawn up in <br>battle array.\" <br>At this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>I <br>\"We have come to perform 'Umrah only and have no <br>intention to fight. Frequent battles have already inflic- <br>ted heavy casualties on Qureysh. If, therefore, they <br>agree, I am prepared to talk over a no-war pact with <br>them, so that they do not fight with me and I may deal <br>with others. If, however, Qureysh do not see their way <br>to accepting this proposal, then by Him who holds my <br>i<br>life in His hand, I will fight them till at last either <br>i<br>Islam prevails or I am slain.\" <br>I <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah: <br>\"Go and faun upon your goddess 'Lat'! We will by no <br>means flee away and leave the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) by himself.\" <br>'Urwah asked: \"Who is he?\" <br>The Prophet: <br>'Urwah: <br>\"He is Abu Bakr.\" <br>\"Abu Bakr! I am in<br>turn you have done <br>for this, I would <br>abuse.\" <br>debted <br>to m<br>have <br>to you f<br>replied <br>e in the <br>or a <br>to <br>good <br>past. But <br>your <br>'Urwah then resumed his deliberations with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). 'Urwah occasionally touched <br>the beard of the Prophet (according to the Arab custom) as <br>he talked. The Sahabah could not tolerate this. Accord- <br>ingly, 'Urwah's own nephew Mughirah bin Shu'bah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was standing armed near by, struck <br>Urwah's hand with the handle of his sword and said: <br>\"Keep your hand away.\" <br>'Urwah: <br>\"Who is he?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the <br>ground arid anoint their faces with it. Hardly a word <br>escapes his lips before all of them run to carry out his <br>wish. When he makes Wudhu, they fight with one an- <br>other to collect some drop of the used water before it <br>t <br>falls on the ground. If any one fails to get that water. he <br>touches the wet hands of the persori who had got it <br>arid then rubs his own hands on the face. When they <br>speak in his presence, they speak in low voice. They <br>I <br>do not lift their gaze to look at his face, out of respect <br>! <br>for him. A hair falling from his head or beard is pre- <br>served to get benediction from it arid is looked upon as <br>i<br>a sacred relic. In short, I have never seen any group of <br>people so devoted to their master as I have seen the <br>companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) towards him.\" <br>At long last, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was commis- <br>sioned by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to nego- <br>tiate with the Qureysh, as he, in spite of his conversion to <br>Islam, commanded respect with them. When 'Usman (Rad- <br>hivallaho anho) had left for Mecca, some of the Sahabah <br>envied Usman's luck in (as they thought) being able to per- <br>form l'awaf of the house of Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on the other hand remarked: <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>249 s= <br>a\"\" <br>o a  <br>\"I do not think he will ever like to do 'l'awaf without <br>me.\" <br>However when 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) entered <br>Mecca, Abaan bi'il Sa'eed took him in his protection and <br>said to him: <br>.:$<br>Svl<br>fa <br>\"You roam where you like. Nobody car1 touch vou.\" <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) carried 011 his negotiations <br>with Abu Sufyan and other chiefs of Mecca on behalf of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and, when he was <br>about to return, the Qureysh the~nselves said to him: <br>\"Now when vou are here at Mecca, you can perforin <br>Tawaf before you return.\" <br>He replied: \"How can it be possible for me when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihc wasailam) has been <br>prevented by you <br>people from ellterilig <br>Mecca.\" <br>This reply was nlost unpalatable for the Qureysh and they <br>decided to detain 'Usman (Kadhivallaho anho) at Mecca. A <br>news reached the Muslims that 'Usnlan (Kadhiyallilho <br>aliho) had been martyred. On this news reaching the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he took the oath of al- <br>legiance from all Sahabah ta fight to the litst drop of their <br>blood. When the Qureysh learnt of this, they got frighteried <br>and imrnediatelv released 'Usrnan (liadhiyallaho anho). <br>In this story, Abu 13akr's (liadhivallaho anho) insultitlg <br>'Urrvah. Mughirah's (Kadhiyallaho anho) treatment of his <br>uncle, the Sahabah's behaviour to\\vards the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe ~lasallanl) as evidenc:ed by 'IJrwiih. and <br>'IJsman's (Kacllii~~allaho <br>anho) refusing to do 'Tawiif '. all <br>speak volumes. aboi~t the love and devotioll of Sahabah for <br>the Prol~het (Sallallnho alaihe wasallam). Tile oath of nlle- <br>giance mentioned in this story is known Bai'atush Shajarah <br>(The Oath of a1 legiance beneath the tree) and is mentioned <br>in the Quran (XLVIII: 18). <br>5. <br>Ibn Zubair's (~adhi~all'aho <br>anho) disposal of blood. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>bled by cupping. The blood was given to Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) to bury it somewhere. He re-<br>turned ant1 informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>lam) that the blood had been disposed of. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves. <br>6. \t Abu 'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) loses His Teeth. <br>During the battle of Uhud, when at one time the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was fiercely attacked <br>by the enemy and two links of the helmet worn by him <br>were struck deep into his head (or face). Abu Bakr and Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) ran to help him. Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) started pulling out the links <br>with his teeth. By the time one of the links was out, he had <br>lost one of his teeth. Without minding this, he again used <br>his teeth to pull up the other link as well. He succeeded in <br>taking out that one too, but he had to lose another tooth in <br>the effort. When the links were drawn out, the blood began <br>to ooze out from the Prophet's body. Malik bin Sinaan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the father of Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), licked the blood with his lips. At this, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The fire of Hell cannot touch the person who has my <br>blood mixed with his.\" <br>7. \t Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) Refuses to Go With His <br>Father. <br>Once in pre-Islam days, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br><br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory. <br>Alas, my lengthening grief and unending distress.\" <br>\"I shall run my swift camels in search of him. I shall <br>search for him round the universe.\" <br>\"The camels may get tired, but I shall not rest, till I <br>die, for death is the end of every hope.\" <br>\"I shall still enjoin on my sons and such and such <br>people, to keep searching for Zaid even after my <br>death.\" <br>.Some people of his clan happened to meet Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) during their pilgrimage to Mecca. They re- <br>lated to him the story of his father's grief and anguish, and <br>recited to him the couplets which he sang in his memory. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) sent a letter to his father through <br>these people. The letter consisted of three couplets ad- <br>dressed to his father assuring him that he was quite well <br>and happy in the present environments with his noble <br>master. When the people went back, they informed his <br>father of his whereabouts and delivered him Zaid's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) message. On receiving the letter, his father <br>and his uncle left for Mecca with sufficient money to <br>ransom Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho). When they came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) they said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Yes, I know them. This is my father and <br>that is my uncl'e.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"And you know me too. They have come to <br>take you back to your home. You have my <br>full permission to go with them. If, on the <br>other hand, you chose to stay on with me, <br>you shall have your choice.\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"How can I prefer anybody else to you? You <br>are everybody for me, including my father <br>and my uncle.\" <br>Zaid's father and uncle: <br>\"0.Zaid! Do you prefer to be a slave? How can you <br>leave your own father, uncle and other members of <br>your family, and remain a bondsman?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Verily, I have seen something in my master <br>that makes me prefer him to everybody else <br>in the world.\" <br>On this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) took Zaid <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) in his lap and said: <br>\"From today, I adopt Zaid as my son.\" <br><br>The father and uncle were quite satisfied with the situation <br>and gladly left Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and returned without him. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was only a child at that time. <br>His preferring to remain a slave, and refusing to go with his <br>own father giving up his home and kith and kin is an ob- <br>vious tribute to his love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). <br>8. \t<br>Anas bin Nadhr's (Radhiyallaho anho) Martyrdom in <br>Uhud. <br>When the Muslims were facing defeat in Uhud, some- <br>body started the rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had been killed. You can imagine the Sahabah's <br>grief and anguish over this tragic news. This, quite natu- <br>rally, caused most of them to lose heart in despair. Anas <br>bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to see 'Umar and <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) with a group of Muslims in <br>a state of utter bewilderment. He said to them: <br>\"Why am I seeing you all so bewildered?\" <br>They said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is slain.\" <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>\"Then who will like to live after him? Come, let us go <br>forward with our swords and join o,ur dear Prophet.\" <br>No sooner did he utter these words than hr plunged <br>into the enemy lines and fought till he was martyred. <br>In fact, Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had such an extreme <br>love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he <br>did not consider this life worth living without him. <br>9. \t<br>Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) Message For The Muslims. <br>During the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What about Sa'd bin Rabee'? I don't know how things <br>have gone with him.\" <br>One of the Sahabah was despatched to search for him. He <br>went to the spot where the bodies of martyrs lay in heaps. <br>He shouted Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) name to know if he <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>was alive. At one place, while he was announcing that he <br>was deputed by the Prophet to enquire about Sa'd bin <br>Rabee' (Radhiyallaho anho), he heard a feeble'voice coming <br>from one direction. He turned to that direction and found <br>that Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was lying among the killed <br>and was about to breathe his last. Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was heard saying: <br>\"Convey my Salaam to the Prophet with my message, <br>'0Prophet of Allah! May Allah grant you on my behalf <br>a reward more exalted and more handsome than the <br>one Allah has ever granted a Prophet on behalf of any <br>of his followers, and tell my Muslim brothers, 'Nothing <br>will absolve you from blame, on the Day of Judgement, <br>if the enemy succeeds in reaching the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) before all of you have fallen.\" <br>With these words, Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) drew his last <br>breath and passed into the presence of Allah. <br>As a matter of fact, the Sahabah have given a true proof <br>of their devotion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). While they suffered wound after wound and were on <br>their last breath, they had no complaint nor wish on their <br>lips and could not think of anything else except about the <br>safety and welfare of the Prophet. Would that a sinner like <br>me be blessed with an atom of the love that the Sahabah <br>bore for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>10. A Woman Dies d n  Seeing the Prophet's Grave. <br>A woman. came to Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and <br>said: <br>\"Take me to the grave of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), so that 1-may be blessed with its sight.\" <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) opened the room that con-<br>tained the grave of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and let her go inside. The woman on seeing the grave <br>started crying in love and memory of the Prophet. In fact <br>she wept so bitterly and incessantly that she swooned and <br>expired there and then (May Allah bless her). The blessed <br>lady recollected the happy days when the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was alive, and then the pangs of sep- <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I</p></div>"

Can the annals of history <br>produce a parallel to such love and devotion? <br>IC1 <br>11. Sahabah's Love For the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and other Anecdotes. <br>Somebody asked Ali (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"How much was the Sahabah's love for the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>He replied: <br>\"By Allah! To us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was dearer than our riches, our children and our <br>mothers, and was more cherishable than a drink of <br>cold water at the time of severest thirst.\" <br>There is no exaggeration kn Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>statement. As a matter of fact, the Sahabah reached this <br>state because of the perfection of their Iman. It could not be <br>otherwise, in the face of what Allah has enjoined viz: <br>\"Say! If your fathers and your sons and your brethren <br>and your wives and your tribe and the wealth you have <br>acquired and the merchandise, for which you fear that <br>there will be no sale, and the dwellings you desire are <br>dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striv- <br>ing in His way, then wait till Allah bringeth His com- <br>mand to pass. Allah guideth not the wrong-doing<br>folk.\" <br>(IX: 24). <br>This verse sounds a note of warning against anything else <br>becoming more attractive than the love of Allah and that of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) report <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"None of you can be a Mo'min until his love-for me is <br>more than his love for his parents, children and all the <br>people of the marld.\"</p></div>"

Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) Eagerness to <br>Fight. <br>When the battle of Uhud was over, the remnant of Sa- <br>habah returned to Madinah, most tired and broken. When <br>the Qureysh, on their way back to Mecca, were camping at <br>a place called Hamra-ul Asad, their chief, Abu Sufyan, sat <br>in council with his lieutenants. They said among them- <br>selves: <br>\"The Muslims are defeated in Uhud. Their morale <br>must be very low. This is the best time to finish Mu- <br>hammad.\" <br>They, therefore, decided to return and attack Madinah. <br>When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) received in- <br>telligence about this council, he ordered all those Sahabah <br>who had participated in Uhud, and who had just returned <br>from the battle, to move out of Madinah and meet the <br>enemy on the way. <br>Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,<br>Prophet of Allah! I was very eager to fight in Uhud, <br>but my father prevented me from going, on the plea <br>that there was no other member in the house to look <br>after my seven sisters and only one of us could join the <br>campaign. As he had made up his mind to go, he bade <br>me stay back with the family. He met the most coveted <br>end [i.e., martyrdom) in Uhud. Now I am very eager to <br>go with you this time and fight the Qureysh.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) allowed him to <br>go. He was the only person in that campaign who had not <br>fought in Uhud. <br>Hadhrat Jabir's (Radhiyallaho anho) father was mar-<br>tyred in Uhud. He left Jabir a big family to look after and <br>large debts to clear, with nothing to live on. The debts were <br>due to one of the Jews, who as we know seldom have any <br>soft corner in their hearts for their debtors. Also his seven <br>sisters for whose sake he was not allowed to go to Uhud- <br>were still there to be boked after. Now look! inspite of all <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>these difficulties, Jabir (Radhiyallaho anho) requests the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to go <br>to the battle. His spirit is really wonderful! <br>13. \t Hadhrat Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho anho) Valour <br>against the Romans. <br>In 26 A.H., 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho), the then Kha- <br>lifah, appointed Abdullah bin Abi Sarah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) as the Governor of Egypt in place of Amr bin Aas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho). Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho), with <br>20 000 Mujahidin, advanced to meet the Roman Army <br>numbering 200 000. It was a very fierce battle. The Roman <br>commander Jarjir made a proclamation saying: <br>\"The person who kills Abdullah will get my daughter's <br>hand in marriage and also 100 000 dinars in prize.\" <br>Some of the Muslims grew anxious over this proclamation. <br>i <br>When Abdullah bin Zubair was informed of this, he said: <br>\"There is nothing to worry about. We may also an- <br>nounce that the person killing Jarjir will get Jarjir's <br>daughter in marriage, 100 000 dinars in prize, and also <br>governorship over the area now ruled by him.\" <br>The fighi was very tough and went on for a long time. <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) succeeded in spotting <br>Jarjir seated behind his forces, under an umbrella of <br>peacock feathers held by two maids. Ibn Zubair (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), all at once, outskirted the Roman <br>troops and approached him. He attacked Jarjir with his <br>sword and severed his head from his body. He then <br>fixed the head oh the point of his spear and returned to <br>his camp, to the utter amazement of both the armies at <br>his matchless valour. <br>When the Sahabah emigrated to Madinah, no son was <br>borne to any of the emigrants for one year after the emigra- <br>tion. The Jews of Madinah said: <br>\"We have cast a spell on the emigrants. They cannot <br>have male issue.\" <br>Abdullah 'bin Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was the first <br>male child born to the Muhajirin. The Muslims were, natu- <br>rally, very happy over his birth. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would not generally allow the children to <br>take oath of allegiance to him. But Abdullah bin Zubair <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>231 gz <br>Gm;g<br>a <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) had the honour of pledging allegiance .=+<br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) when he was <br>g m<br>* <br>only seven. During this battle, he was barely in his early <br>twenties. To go single-handed and kill the commander, <br>after hoodwinking his army of 200 000 men, at this age is <br>really marvellous. <br>14. \t Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) Leads <br>in Salaat. <br>Hadhrat Amr bin Salamah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"We lived with our father at a place on the caravan <br>route to Madinah. When a caravan from Madinah <br>passed our village, we asked the people therein about <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They would <br>tell us that he claimed to be receiving revelations from <br>Allah, and they would also recite a few verses of the <br>Qur'an before us to give us an idea about his claim. <br>Then I immediately used to commit those verses to <br>memory. In this way, I remembered a good portion of <br>the Qur'an, even before I embraced Islam. All the <br>desert tribes were waiting for Mecca to fall to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) before they em- <br>braced Islam. On his victorious entry into Mecca, <br>deputations from all the tribes began to come to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in order to accept <br>Islam. My father headed the group who went to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to pledge alle- <br>giance to him on behalf of our tribe. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) taught them the basic <br>regulations about Salaat and other Islamic practices. <br>He said to them, \"The person who knows more Qur'an <br>is entitled to lead in Salaat. Now it so happened that <br>none in my tribe knew so much Qur'an as I did. They <br>searched for an Imam, but they could not find a person <br>knowing more Qur'an than me. I was, therefore, made <br>Imam. At that time, I was only seven. I led the congre; <br>gational Salaat and funeral service if any.\" <br>It was his natural inclination and affinity towards Islam <br>that made him remember so much of the Qur'an when he <br>was only a boy and he had not even embraced Islam. <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>15. \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Teaches His Slave. <br>Ikramah the slave of Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) is one of the eminent ulama. He says: <br>\"During my learning the Qur'an and Hadith, I was kept <br>in chains by my master, so that I might not go any- <br>where and devote full time to my lessons.\" <br>In fact, real knowledge can only be acquired when one <br>is totally devoted to it. The students who are in the habit of <br>wasting their time in roaming about and enjoying them- <br>selves can seldom acquire deep knowledge. It was the <br>result of this labour that Ikramah was later on called. \"The <br>ocean of knowledge\" and \"The most learned man of the <br>Ummat.\" Qatadah says: <br>\"There are four most learned men among the Tabi'ees, <br>and Ikramah is one of them.\" <br>16. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) Memorises <br>the Qur'an in His Childhood. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) used <br>to say to the people: <br>\"Come to me for your difficulties in understanding the <br>Qur'an. I memorised it while I was only a child.\" <br>In another Hadith, he is reported to have said: <br>\"I had completed my reading of the Qur'an when I'was <br>only ten.\" <br>r <br>The reading of the Qur'an by Sahabah was not done <br>like the reading by the non-Arabs of today. Whatever they <br>read, they read with full meaning and explanation. As the <br>impression of something memorised in childhood is very <br>deep and permanent, so Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is accepted as Imam in Tafsir. None of the Sahabah <br>has narrated more Ahadith explaining the meaning of <br>Qur'an than was done by Ibn Abbas. Abdullah bin Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is the best <br>commentator of the Qur'an.\" <br>Abu Abdur Rahman (Rahmatullah alaih), on the authority <br>of Sahabah who taught him the Qur'an, says: <br><br>\"The Sahabah learnt ten verses of the Qur'an from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at a time. They <br>would not take the next lesson until tf ey had mastered <br>the knowledge and acted upon those ten verses.\" <br>Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was 13 at the <br>time of the Prophet's death. It is miracle that he knew so <br>much of the Qur'an and Hadith at such a young age. Many <br>eminent Sahabah used to come to him to solve their diffi- <br>culties about the interpretation of the Qur'an. This was, <br>however, all due to the blessing of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), who once coming out from the closet had <br>found water lying ready for his use and inquired: <br>\"Who put this water here?\" <br>Somebody said: \"Ibn Abbas.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated the <br>service and prayed for Ibn Abbas: <br>''0,<br>Allah! Give him the knowledge and understanding <br>of the Qur'an and practices of Islam.\" <br>On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was saying his Salaat. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>joined him in Salaat by standing behind him. The Prophet <br>caught him by the hand and drew him to his side. (When <br>there is only one follower in Salaat with Jamaat, he stands <br>by the side of Imam and not after him). While the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was busy in Salaat, he moved <br>back a little distance. When the Salaat was over, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him: <br>\"What made you recede from your place?\" <br>Hesaid: \t \"You are the Prophet of Allah!. How could I <br>stand with you.\" <br>On this occasion too, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) prayed for his knowledge and understanding. <br>17. \t ~ b d u l l a hbin Amr bin Aas Notes Down Ahadith: <br>Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>one of the most pious Sahabah. Daily he used to fast during <br>the day, and finish one Qur'an during the night. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) restrained him from <br>this excessive devotion and said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"You will get weak by daily fasting, and your eye-sight <br>will suffer by keeping awake very night. You owe some <br>obligation to your body, the members of your family, <br>and those who come to visit you.\" <br>He says: \t \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then <br>advised me to take not less than a month to <br>finish one Qur'an. I said, \"0,Prophet of Allah! <br>This is too little. Let me make full use of my <br>strength while I am still young.\" He then re-<br>duced the period to 20 days. I kept on repeating <br>my words and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) continued reducing the period, till fi- <br>nally I was permitted to take three days in <br>finishing one reading of the Qur'an.\" <br>He had a collection of the Hadith compiled by him, <br>which he had named \"Sadiqah (True)\". He says: <br>':I used to put down all that I heard from the Prophet <br>ballalaho alaihe wasallam). People once said to me, <br>'The Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) is after all a <br>human being and many words uttered by him in anger <br>or humour are actually not meant by him. You should <br>not write each and every thing spoken by him.' I ac- <br>cepted the advice. On my once mentioning this to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he said, 'You <br>keep doing as before. By Him who holds my life in His <br>hand, my lips do not utter anything except the truth, <br>even in anger or joy.\" <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"No one has narrated about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) more than me, except Abdullah bin <br>Amr. This is because he used to note down what he <br>heard, while I relied on my memory.\" <br>This is really wonderful, especially when we know that <br>most of his time was reading the Qur'an and other acts of <br>piety. <br>18. Zaid bin Thabit Memorises the Qur'an. <br>Zaid bin Thabit (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of those <br>eminent Sahabah who are considered to be most learned <br>and whose words in religious matters carry much weight. <br>He was an expert in regulations regarding obligatory prac- <br>tices. It is said that he was among the top ranking jurists, <br><br>Ch. XI: Children's Devotion to Islam <br>(I -<br>sq <br>judges and Qaris. He was only 11 when the Prophet (Sallal- -3 <br>0P1 <br>laho alaihe wasallam) emigrated to Madinah. That is why, 5 2 <br>m<br>in spite of his eagerness, he was not allowed to participate <br>in the early battles like Badr, etc. He had lost his father <br>when he was six. When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) arrived in Madinah, people brought their children <br>to him to receive his blessing. Zaid was also brought to him <br>for the same purpose. He says: <br>\"When I was presented to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), he was informed that I had then <br>memorised seventeen soorahs of the Qur'an. In order <br>to test me, he bade me to recite some of these. I recited <br>Surah Qaaf. He rewarded me with his words of appre- <br>ciation.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), when writ- <br>ing letters to the Jews outside Madinah, used to utilise the <br>services of the local Jews. Once he said to Zaid: <br>\"I am not satisfied with what the Jews write and read <br>for me. I apprehend mischief from them in miswriting <br>or misreading. I desire you to learn the Jewish lan- <br>guage.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"In fifteen days, I mastered Hebrew and after that I <br>started doing all such correspondence for him.\" <br>According to another Hadith, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>is reported to have similarly mastered the Syriac language <br>at the instance of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>He managed this within the short period of 17 days only. <br>19. Hasan's Knowledge of Islam. <br>The head of Sayyids, Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>born in Ramadhan, 3 A. H. He was thus a little over seven <br>years old at the time of the Prophet's death. In spite of his <br>tender age, quite a few Ahadith have been narrated by him. <br>Abul Howraa once asked him: <br>\"Do you remember any saying of the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>He said: <br>\"Yes. Once I was going with him. On the way I saw a <br>large quantity of dates of Sadaqah piled up at one <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>place. I took a date from the pile and put it into my <br>mouth. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ex- <br>claimed, 'Kakh! Kakh!' (exclamation of disapproval) <br>and then he took out the date from my mouth with the <br>help of his finger, saying: 'Eating the Sadaqah is not <br>permissible for us (i.e. family of the Prophet)'. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had taught me <br>how to say my five times daily Salaat.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised me <br>to recite the following prayer for my Witr: <br>J %J&j 49s&,Q& 9>&, &\" s<br>-<br>I <br>.,J4yG!&&?* ,&&!,uL<br>*-.,&\\a<br>$j<br>, \t<br>2 &J <br>.I <br>d<br>~ gj &jY<br>j <br>a.,j <br>\"0, Allah! Guide me along with those whom Thou <br>hast guided. Keep me in ease along with those whom <br>Thou hast kept in ease. Be my protecting friend along <br>with those whose protecting friend Thou has been. <br>Bless me in what Thou hast granted me. Grant me pro- <br>tection against the ill-effects of what may have been or- <br>dained for me, for Thy decision is final and nobody <br>can decide against Thy will. He who has Thee as the <br>protecting Friend cannot be abased. 0,Our Lord! Thou <br>art blessed and Thou art the Highest.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>\"The person who keeps sitting till sunrise at the place <br>where he said his Fajr prayers shall be saved from the <br>Hell.\" <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) performed his Hajj many times <br>by covering the distance from Madinah to Mecca on foot <br>and, when asked about his reasons for undergoing such <br>hardships. he remarked: <br>\"I feel ashamed to face Allah (after my death) without <br>having gone to Mecca on foot for pilgrimage tp his <br>House.\" <br>Hasan is reputed for his piety and mildness. He is respon- <br>sible for narrating many Ahadith, collected by Imaam <br><br>Ahmad in his Musnad. The author of 'Talqih' has included <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) among those who have reported <br>as many as 13 Ahadith. To have remembered so many Aha- <br>dith at the age of 7 shows his devotion to Islam and his re- <br>markable memory. On the other hand, our children at this <br>age generally do not know even the elements of Islam. <br>20. \t Husain's Zeal for Knowledge. <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) was one year junior to <br>Hasan (Radhiyallaho anha), his brother. He was a little over <br>6 at the time of the Prophet's death. Nothing much can be <br>expected from a child of this age, but there are quite a few <br>Ahadith narrated by Husain (Radhiyallaho anho). Muhad- <br>dithin count him among those Sahabah who are respon- <br>sible for giving us at least 8 Ahadith. <br>The following Ahadith are among those narrated by <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>1. \t \"Each time a person recites 'Inna-lillahi-wa-inna- <br>Ilaihi-raaji-oon' when he recalls or is otherwise re- <br>minded of an adversity previously met by him, he <br>receives a reward from Allah as good as he would <br>have had at the time of actual infliction.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"A Muslim gets immunity from drowning while <br>crossing a river if, at the time of embarking, he re- <br>cites: \". O <br>* 0 ! ;  <br>0 , .  <br>( t r \t y)wj jpJJJ d! kL>j G$+ <br>& <br>(In the name of Allah be its course and its moor- <br>ing. Lo! My Lord is, surely, most Forgiving, most <br>Merciful).\" <br>3. \t \"To shun vain things makes one a good Muslim.\" <br>Rabee'ah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"I once asked Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) if he re-<br>membered any incident in the life of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). He said, 'Yes. Once <br>managed to get on to a few dates lying near a window <br>and put one of them into my mouth. The Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) bade me take out and throw <br>away the date, as we (i.e. his family members) were not <br>permitted to eat anything from Sadaqah.\" <br>I <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) had gone on foot 25 times <br>for pilgrimage to Mecca. He was very punctual in fasting, <br>saying Nafl and spending on the poor. <br>We find quite a few Sahabah narrating many sayings, <br>which they had heard from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) in their childhood. Mahmood bin Rab-ee' (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) was only five at the time of the Prophet's <br>death. He says: <br>\"Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>to our house. We had a well inside the house. He filled <br>some water in his mouth from that well and then <br>squirted it on my face. I shall never forget this inci- <br>dent.\" <br>We are in the habit of engaging our children in vain talk, <br>confusing their minds by telling them fictitious stories and <br>frightening them with the giants and the Jinns. If, instead, <br>we induce them to read the lives of great men of Islam, nar- <br>rate to them stories of the pious people and warn them of <br>the consequences of Allah's disobedience, they may be <br>greatly benefited in their life in this world and in the Here- <br>after. In childhood the memory is at its best. Anything <br>memorised at that time is seldom forgotten. If children are <br>made to memorise the Qur'an, they will be able to do so <br>very easily and quickly. I have heard very frequently from <br>the elderly ladies of my family and from my respected <br>father himself that he had memorised one fourth of the <br>thirtieth part of the Qur'an even before he was weaned, and <br>he had finished memorising the whole Qur'an and, on the <br>top of that, he had read a few standard books in Persian lit- <br>erature (the latter 6f his own accord) while he was only <br>seven. He once narrated to me: <br>\"When I had finished memorising the Qur'an, my <br>father required me to repeat (from memory) the full <br>Qur'an once daily, and permitted me to play for the <br>rest of the day. I used to sit on the roof of the house <br>(being summer) and start reciting the Qur'an just after <br>Fajr. I would finish the whole of it in about seven <br>hours. I then had my lunch. In the evening, I used to <br>have lessons in Persian, though it was not compulsory <br>for me. To this routine I stuck for full six months.\" <br>It is not an ordinary thing for a child of seven to recite <br>the Qur'an once daily for full six months, along with learn- <br><br>ing other things. As a result, he would never forget or <br>commit an error when reciting the Qur'an from memory. <br>Apparently, he earned his livelihood by trade in books. He <br>was found reciting the Qur'an with his lips, even when his <br>hands were engaged in his job. Sometimes he would even <br>teach the boys (who wanted to learn from him after the <br>school hours), while himself reciting the Qur'an and doing <br>his job. He thus attended to three things at a time. But his <br>way of teaching his students was different from that <br>adopted currently in the schools, where the entire burden <br>is on the teachers. He simply listened to the student <br>reading, translating and explaining the meaning. If the stu- <br>dent was correct, he simply said, \"'Go ahead,\" but if the <br>student made some error or needed some further explana- <br>tion, then he only would correct or explain as the gase <br>might be. Now, this story is not of ancient times; this has <br>happened only recently. It is therefore wrong to presume <br>jhat the Muslims of today, being of poor physical strength, <br>cannot try to follow the footsteps of their ancestors in <br>Islam. <br><br>CHAPTER XI1 <br>LOVE FOR THE PROPHET <br>What we have hitherto read about the achievement of <br>the Sahabah in their time was in fact the result of their love <br>for Allah and for His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Love, as a matter of fact, was a great dynamic force in the <br>Sahabah's career. It was this force that made them forego <br>their luxuries, forget their lives, give up all their desires for <br>wealth, ignore all afflictions, and have no fear of death <br>even. There is no room for any other consideration (except <br>that of beloved) in the heart saturated with love. May Allah <br>through His Grace grant us His own love and that of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), so that we may be <br>blessed with devotion in His worship and have sense of <br>comfort in all difficulties faced in His service. <br>1. Abu Bakr's [Radhiyallaho anho) Sufferings for Islam. <br>In the beginning, those who embraced Islam had to <br>keep their faith secret, as far as possible. As the Muslims <br>were being constantly persecuted by the Qureysh, even the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised all new con- <br>verts to practise Islam secretly, so that they might not have <br>to suffer at the hands of Qureysh. When, however, the <br>number of Muslims reached 39, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) made a suggestion for the open preaching and prac- <br>tising of Islam. ThepProphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>would not agree, but, when Abu Bakr (Radhivallaho anho) <br>insisted. he gave his consent and so all of them went to <br>Haram for Tabligh. Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) began to <br>speak, and the Khutbah given by him was the first ever de- <br>livered in the annals of Islam. Hamzah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>i <br>the Prophet's uncle and the Chief of Martyrs embraced <br>k <br>Islam on that very day, while 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came into the Muslim fold on the third day of this address. <br>No sooner did Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) start speaking <br>I<br>than the idolaters and disbelievers from amongst the Qu- <br>reysh fell upon the Muslims from all sides. Despite the fact <br>that he was considered to be the noblest and most respect- <br>able of all the people in Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was beaten to such an extent that his nose and ears <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>241 4c <br>$2<br>and his entire face were besmeared with blood. He was <br>kicked. thrashed with shoes, trampled under feet and han- <br>8 1  <br>dled most roughly and savagely. He became unconscious <br>vlI g  <br>and half-dead; none hoped that he would ever survive this <br>brutal onslaught. Banu Teem, the people of his clan, came <br>and carried him to his house. They also announced in the <br>Haram that if Abu Bakr succumbed to the injuries, they <br>would in retaliation take the life of Utbah bin Rabee'ah, <br>who had taken the most active part in the attack. Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) remained unconscious the whole day. <br>People round him shouted his name again and again to <br>know if he was in senses, but he would not speak. Late in <br>the evening however he opened his eyes and showed signs <br>of consciousness. As soon as he was able to speak, he en- <br>quired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>The people were most disappointed with him and they <br>said: <br>\"How is it that, despite all this calamity and after vir- <br>tually remaining in the jaws of death all day long on <br>account of the Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as <br>soon as he has come back to consciousness he has <br>nothing else to talk about, but the Prophet himself.\" <br>They left Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), much disgusted at <br>his devotion for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while they were satisfied that he was out of danger. They <br>advised Umme Khair, his mother, to give him something to <br>eat. But least minding his food, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) would incessantly and impatiently ask his mother <br>the same question again and again i.e. <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>On her showing ignorance about the welfare of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), Abu Bakr entreated <br>her to go to Umme Jamil (Umar's sister) and find out from <br>her the latest news about the Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). The mother could not refuse the request of her son <br>in this pitiable condition, and hurried to Umme Jamil's <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) house to enquire about the welfare of <br>Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Like,other Mus- <br>lims of that time, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallah anha) was also <br>keeping her faith secret. She therefore concealed her <br>Stories of the Scrhaabah <br>knowledge about the Prophet (SallalIaho alaihe wasallam), <br>saying: <br>\"Who is Muhammad and who is Abu Bakr? Why <br>should I know anything about them? I am however <br>sorry to learn about the condition of your son; if you <br>like, I can go with you to see him.\" <br>Umme Khair agreed and they both came to Abu Bakr. On <br>seeing Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) in that miserable con- <br>dition, Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) could not control <br>herself and began to cry, saying: <br>\"Woe to the ruffians for what they have done to a man <br>like Abu Bakr. May Allah punish them for their mis- <br>conduct.\" <br>Regardless of what Umme Jamil (Radhiyallaho anha) said, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) had the same words on his <br>lips viz: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil (pointing towards Umme Khair): <br>\"Is it safe to say anything in her presence?\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"Do not worry about her. Tell me quickly <br>i <br>how is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam)?\" <br>Umme Jamil: \"He is quite well.\" <br>i <br>Abu Bakr: <br>\"Where is he at this moment.\" <br>Umme Jamil: \t \"Heis at Arqam's place.\" <br>Abu Bakr: \t<br>\"By Allah! I will not eat anything until I <br>have looked at him.\" <br>Now, his mother was very anxious to feed him. She <br>knew that when he had sworn by Allah he would not break <br>his oath and, therefore, would not eat under any circum- <br>stances. She therefore agreed to take him to Arqam's place. <br>She had to wait till the street was least-frequented by the <br>people and she was able to take him to that place unde- <br>tected by Qureysh. When they both reached Arqam's place, <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) saw the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and clung to him weeping profusely. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) reciprocated, and all <br>the Muslims who were present there also began to weep <br><br>bitterly over the condition of Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) then iptroduced his <br>mother Umme Khair to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), saying: <br>\"She is my mother, 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray for her <br>and induce her to accept Islam.\" <br>The prophet first prayed for her and then preached to her. <br>She accepted Islam there and then. <br>Many people can claim to be lovers while in ease and <br>comfort. But a lover is a real lover when he is able to prove <br>his love even in the tribulation and adversity. <br>2. \t<br>'Umar's (Radhiyallaho anho) Grief at the Prophet's <br>Death. <br>None can deny the proverbial valour, courage and <br>strength of 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), over whose men- <br>tion, even after the lapse of 1400 years, hearts are struck <br>with awe and respect. Islam could not be professed and <br>preached openly before 'Umar's coming into its fold. As <br>soon as he embraced Islam, the Muslims started saying <br>Salaat in the Haram, as none could dare harm them with <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their side. Notwithstanding <br>all this, he could not bear the shock of the Prophet passing <br>away. So much so that he stood with sword in his hand, ut- <br>terly confused and bewildered, saying: <br>\"I shall behead the person who says that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has passed away. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has only gone to <br>visit his Lord, just as Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone <br>to Toor. He will shortly return and cut off the hands <br>and feet of those who were spreading the false news of <br>his death.\" <br>On the other hand, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>stunned with grief on this event. He could not utter a single <br>word, even till the next day, and walked about as if bereft <br>of speech. Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), too, was in terrible <br>grief. He was still and motionless. Only Abu Bakr, (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) for all his love of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as we have seen in the last story, stood <br>firm as a rock against this terrible storm of grief and did not <br>lose his mental composure. He calmly entered the Proph- <br>et's house, kissed his forehead and came back to the <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>people. He called 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to sit down, <br>and began to address the people. He said: <br>\"Whoso worshipped Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), let him know that Muhammad is no more, <br>and whoso worshipped Allah should know that Allah <br>is Everliving and Eternal. He then recited the following <br>verse of the Qur'an: <br>\"Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers, the like <br>of those who have passed away before him. Will it be <br>that when he dies or is slain, Ye will turn back on your <br>heels. He who turneth back doth not hurt Allah, and <br>Allah will reward those who recognise the Truth. <br>(111: 144).\" <br>As Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) was destined to be <br>the Khalifah after the Prophet, (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) <br>E<br>it is significa~t that, unlike other Sahabah, he behaved with <br>the composure and patience that were needed on an oc- <br>casion like this. Again. it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) alone who knew better than anybody else about the <br>regulations regarding the burial, inheritance, etc, of the <br>Prophet (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam). When difference of <br>opinion arose among the Sahabah whether the burial place <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) be at Mecca or <br>Madinah or jerusalenl, it was Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) who settled the difference by saying on the authority <br>of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the Proph- <br>ets are buried where they have died. There were several <br>other Ahadith known only to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that helped solve many of the other problems arising <br>/<br>out of the death of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>t <br>lam). Some of these Ahadith were: \t<br>i <br>(1) \"Prophets have no heirs. All that a Prophet leaves <br>behind is Sadaqah.\" <br>i<br>(2) \t\"Allah's curse is on the Amir who does not take <br>proper interest and excercise proper care in the ap- <br>pointment of his deputies.\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>245 4%I <br>(3) \"The state affairs shall remain in the custody of <br>Qureysh.\" <br>*=31 <br>m <br>3. An Ansari Woman's Anxiety About the Prophet. <br>In the battle of Uhud, the Muslims suffered heavy <br>losses and quite a large number of them were killed. When <br>the sensational news of their heavy casualties reached <br>Madinah, the women came out of their houses eager to <br>know the actual details of these casualties. On seeing the <br>crowd of people at a place, a woman of the Ansar anx- <br>iously inquired: <br>\"How is the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?\" <br>When told that her father was killed in the battle, she ut- <br>tered 'Inna Lillah' and impatiently repeated the same ques- <br>tion about the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), This <br>time she was told that her husband was no more, her <br>brother was dead and that her son too was slain. With ever- <br>growing anxiety, she repeated the same question about the <br>welfare of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She <br>was told that he was safe and sound, but she would not rest <br>contented, and insisted on seeing him herself. When at last <br>she had satisfied her eyes with his sight, she said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, every affliction is eased and every <br>worry removed with the blessing of seeing you.\" <br>According to another version, she herself clung to the <br>Prophet's robes and said: <br>\"0Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to me than my par- <br>ents. The death of my kinsmen has lost all its sting for <br>me when I have seen you living.\" <br>There are several incidents of this kind that occurred <br>after the battle of Uhud. It is, perhaps, for the large number <br>of such incidents that different names have been reported <br>by different narrators about these women. In fact, such in- <br>cidents happened in large numbers with many women of <br>that time. <br>4. <br>The Behaviour of Sahabah at Hudeybiyah. <br>The campaign of Hudeybiyah took place in 6 A.H., <br>when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with a large <br>number of Sahabah was going to Mecca with the intention <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>of performing 'Umrah. The Qureysh came to know of this <br>and decided to prevent their entry into Mecca. They also <br>decided to invite the neighbouring tribes of Mecca for help, <br>r <br>and made large-scale preparations for battle. When the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho ala$e wasallam) reached Zul Hulaifah, <br>he sent a man to bring intelligence about the Qureysh. <br>i <br>When the Prophet (Sallalleho alaihe wasallam) reached <br>Asfan, the person returned from Mecca with the informa- <br>tion that the Qureysh were equipped to the teeth to resist <br>the Prophet's entry into Mecca and that the neighbouring <br>tribes also were by their side. At this, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) consulted the eminent Sahabah to <br>consider the situation. One proposal was to attack the <br>houses of the tribes who had sent their men to help the Qu- <br>reysh (so that they might forsake Qureysh in order to pro- <br>tect their own homes), and the other was to march straight <br>towards Mecca, Abu Bakr (Radhiyallahoanho) said: <br>i <br>I <br>\"0 Prophet of Allah! We have come to perform <br>'Umrah. We have no intention of fighting with the Qu- <br>reysh. Let us go ahead. If they stop us we shall fight, <br>otherwise not.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) agreed to the pro- <br>posal of ~ b b  <br>to<br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) and decided <br>march ahead towards Mecca. When he reached Hudey- <br>biyah, Budail bin Waraqa Khuza'i met him with a group of <br>! <br>people. He said: <br>\"The Qureysh uncler no circumstances will permit <br>i <br>your entry intb Mecca. They are already drawn up in <br>battle array.\" <br>At this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>I <br>\"We have come to perform 'Umrah only and have no <br>intention to fight. Frequent battles have already inflic- <br>ted heavy casualties on Qureysh. If, therefore, they <br>agree, I am prepared to talk over a no-war pact with <br>them, so that they do not fight with me and I may deal <br>with others. If, however, Qureysh do not see their way <br>to accepting this proposal, then by Him who holds my <br>i<br>life in His hand, I will fight them till at last either <br>i<br>Islam prevails or I am slain.\" <br>I <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>Budail returned to the Qureysh and conveyed to them what <br>the Prophet had told him. But they did not agree to the <br>peace proposal of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Parleys between the two sides however continued and, at <br>one time, Urwah bin Mas'ood Thaqafi was sent by Qureysh <br>as a plenipotentiary. Urwah had not then accepted Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) talked to him in <br>the same strain as he had done to Budail. 'Urwah said: <br>\"0 Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! If you <br>want to slay all the Arabs you cannot possibly do so, as <br>none before you has ever succeeded in putting an end <br>to all the Arabs. On the contrary if the Arabs get the <br>upper hand, then take it from me that these persons <br>round you will disappear in no time, leaving, you all <br>alone, for I don't find any people of high birth among <br>them. In fact they all come from a low stock drawn <br>from all corners who will desert in trouble.\" <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), standing close by, was infu- <br>riated at this statement, and resentfully told 'Urwah: <br>\"Go and faun upon your goddess 'Lat'! We will by no <br>means flee away and leave the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) by himself.\" <br>'Urwah asked: \"Who is he?\" <br>The Prophet: <br>'Urwah: <br>\"He is Abu Bakr.\" <br>\"Abu Bakr! I am in<br>turn you have done <br>for this, I would <br>abuse.\" <br>debted <br>to m<br>have <br>to you f<br>replied <br>e in the <br>or a <br>to <br>good <br>past. But <br>your <br>'Urwah then resumed his deliberations with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). 'Urwah occasionally touched <br>the beard of the Prophet (according to the Arab custom) as <br>he talked. The Sahabah could not tolerate this. Accord- <br>ingly, 'Urwah's own nephew Mughirah bin Shu'bah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who was standing armed near by, struck <br>Urwah's hand with the handle of his sword and said: <br>\"Keep your hand away.\" <br>'Urwah: <br>\"Who is he?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet: \t (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"He is Mughirah.\" <br>'Urwah: \t<br>\"0. you betraver! How dare you maltreat <br>your uncle. who is still suffering for your <br>misbehaviour.\" <br>(Before Islam. Mughirah, [Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>killed a few persons. Urwah paid the blood money on his <br>behalf, and was referring to this incident). During his long <br>discourse with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>'Urwah's had been quietly observing the behaviour of the <br>Sahabah towards their Master: so when he returned to Qu- <br>reysh he said to them: <br>\"0, Qureysh! I have been an envoy to many great <br>kings. 1 have seen the courts of Caesar, the Chosroes <br>and the Negus. By Allah! Nowhere have I seen the <br>people around a sovereign so respectful to him as I <br>I <br>found the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). When Muhammad spits, they rush to <br>I<br>/<br>receive the sputum in their hands before it touches the <br>ground arid anoint their faces with it. Hardly a word <br>escapes his lips before all of them run to carry out his <br>wish. When he makes Wudhu, they fight with one an- <br>other to collect some drop of the used water before it <br>t <br>falls on the ground. If any one fails to get that water. he <br>touches the wet hands of the persori who had got it <br>arid then rubs his own hands on the face. When they <br>speak in his presence, they speak in low voice. They <br>I <br>do not lift their gaze to look at his face, out of respect <br>! <br>for him. A hair falling from his head or beard is pre- <br>served to get benediction from it arid is looked upon as <br>i<br>a sacred relic. In short, I have never seen any group of <br>people so devoted to their master as I have seen the <br>companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) towards him.\" <br>At long last, 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) was commis- <br>sioned by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to nego- <br>tiate with the Qureysh, as he, in spite of his conversion to <br>Islam, commanded respect with them. When 'Usman (Rad- <br>hivallaho anho) had left for Mecca, some of the Sahabah <br>envied Usman's luck in (as they thought) being able to per- <br>form l'awaf of the house of Allah. The Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) on the other hand remarked: <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>249 s= <br>a\"\" <br>o a  <br>\"I do not think he will ever like to do 'l'awaf without <br>me.\" <br>However when 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) entered <br>Mecca, Abaan bi'il Sa'eed took him in his protection and <br>said to him: <br>.:$<br>Svl<br>fa <br>\"You roam where you like. Nobody car1 touch vou.\" <br>'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) carried 011 his negotiations <br>with Abu Sufyan and other chiefs of Mecca on behalf of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and, when he was <br>about to return, the Qureysh the~nselves said to him: <br>\"Now when vou are here at Mecca, you can perforin <br>Tawaf before you return.\" <br>He replied: \"How can it be possible for me when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihc wasailam) has been <br>prevented by you <br>people from ellterilig <br>Mecca.\" <br>This reply was nlost unpalatable for the Qureysh and they <br>decided to detain 'Usman (Kadhivallaho anho) at Mecca. A <br>news reached the Muslims that 'Usnlan (Kadhiyallilho <br>aliho) had been martyred. On this news reaching the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he took the oath of al- <br>legiance from all Sahabah ta fight to the litst drop of their <br>blood. When the Qureysh learnt of this, they got frighteried <br>and imrnediatelv released 'Usrnan (liadhiyallaho anho). <br>In this story, Abu 13akr's (liadhivallaho anho) insultitlg <br>'Urrvah. Mughirah's (Kadhiyallaho anho) treatment of his <br>uncle, the Sahabah's behaviour to\\vards the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe ~lasallanl) as evidenc:ed by 'IJrwiih. and <br>'IJsman's (Kacllii~~allaho <br>anho) refusing to do 'Tawiif '. all <br>speak volumes. aboi~t the love and devotioll of Sahabah for <br>the Prol~het (Sallallnho alaihe wasallam). Tile oath of nlle- <br>giance mentioned in this story is known Bai'atush Shajarah <br>(The Oath of a1 legiance beneath the tree) and is mentioned <br>in the Quran (XLVIII: 18). <br>5. <br>Ibn Zubair's (~adhi~all'aho <br>anho) disposal of blood. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>bled by cupping. The blood was given to Abdullah bin <br>Zubair (Kadhiyallaho anho) to bury it somewhere. He re-<br>turned ant1 informed the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>lam) that the blood had been disposed of. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What did you do with it?\" <br>Ibn-Zubair said: \"I have swallowed it.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The person who has my blood in his body cannot be <br>touched by fire of Hell. But you will kill people and <br>people will kill you.\" <br>Everything coming out of the Prophet's body is clean. <br>No doubt, therefore. remains in understanding Ibn Zubair's <br>action. The last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), however, make prophesy about the battles for <br>power. which Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) had to fight <br>with Yazid and Abdul Malik. In the later part of his life, <br>Ibn Zubair (Radhiyallaho anho) was killed in one of these <br>battles. Even at the time of Ibn Zubair's (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) birth, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>remarked that he was a sheep among the cloaked wolves. <br>6. \t Abu 'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) loses His Teeth. <br>During the battle of Uhud, when at one time the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was fiercely attacked <br>by the enemy and two links of the helmet worn by him <br>were struck deep into his head (or face). Abu Bakr and Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) ran to help him. Abu <br>'Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) started pulling out the links <br>with his teeth. By the time one of the links was out, he had <br>lost one of his teeth. Without minding this, he again used <br>his teeth to pull up the other link as well. He succeeded in <br>taking out that one too, but he had to lose another tooth in <br>the effort. When the links were drawn out, the blood began <br>to ooze out from the Prophet's body. Malik bin Sinaan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), the father of Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), licked the blood with his lips. At this, the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"The fire of Hell cannot touch the person who has my <br>blood mixed with his.\" <br>7. \t Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) Refuses to Go With His <br>Father. <br>Once in pre-Islam days, Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br><br>travelling in a caravan, with his mother going to her <br>father's town, when the caravan was way-laid by Banu <br>Qais. They took Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) as slave and sold <br>him in Mecca. Hakim bin Hazam purchased him for his <br>aunt Khadijah (Radhiyallaho anha), who offered him as a <br>present to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at the <br>time of her marriage with him. On the other hand, Zaid's <br>(Kadhiyallaho anho) father was in immense grief at the loss <br>of the son. He roamed about in search of him, lamenting <br>his separation in the following heart-rendering verses: <br>\"I weep in memory of Zaid, while I know not whether <br>he is alive (to be hoped for) or finished by death.\" <br>\"0,Zaid, By Allah, no knowledge I have, whether you <br>are killed on soft soil or on a rock.\" <br>\"Ah, I wish I knew whether you would ever come back <br>to me, for that is the only desire I am living for.\" <br>\"I remember Zaid when the sun rises in the East. I re- <br>member him when the rain comes from the clouds.\" <br>\"The blowing wind kindles the fire of his memory. <br>Alas, my lengthening grief and unending distress.\" <br>\"I shall run my swift camels in search of him. I shall <br>search for him round the universe.\" <br>\"The camels may get tired, but I shall not rest, till I <br>die, for death is the end of every hope.\" <br>\"I shall still enjoin on my sons and such and such <br>people, to keep searching for Zaid even after my <br>death.\" <br>.Some people of his clan happened to meet Zaid (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) during their pilgrimage to Mecca. They re- <br>lated to him the story of his father's grief and anguish, and <br>recited to him the couplets which he sang in his memory. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) sent a letter to his father through <br>these people. The letter consisted of three couplets ad- <br>dressed to his father assuring him that he was quite well <br>and happy in the present environments with his noble <br>master. When the people went back, they informed his <br>father of his whereabouts and delivered him Zaid's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) message. On receiving the letter, his father <br>and his uncle left for Mecca with sufficient money to <br>ransom Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho). When they came to the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) they said: <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>\"0,son of Hashim and the chief of Qureysh. You are <br>the dweller of the Haram and the neighbour of Allah. <br>You are known for freeing the captives and feeding the <br>hungry. We have come to you in quest of our son. <br>Accept the ransom money for Zaid and set him free. <br>We are willing to pay even more than the ransom <br>money. Pray, show mercy and be kind to us.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"What do you wish to do with Zaid?\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"We want to take him with us to our place.\" <br>The Prophet: \t<br>\"Is that all? Allright, then call Zaid and ask <br>him. If he wishes to go with you, I shall let <br>him go without any ransom. But I shall not <br>send him against his wishes.\" <br>Zaid's father: \t \"You have shown us more favour than we <br>deserve. We most gladly agree to what you <br>say.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was presently sent for. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to Zaid: \"Do you <br>know these men?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Yes, I know them. This is my father and <br>that is my uncl'e.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"And you know me too. They have come to <br>take you back to your home. You have my <br>full permission to go with them. If, on the <br>other hand, you chose to stay on with me, <br>you shall have your choice.\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"How can I prefer anybody else to you? You <br>are everybody for me, including my father <br>and my uncle.\" <br>Zaid's father and uncle: <br>\"0.Zaid! Do you prefer to be a slave? How can you <br>leave your own father, uncle and other members of <br>your family, and remain a bondsman?\" <br>Zaid: \t<br>\"Verily, I have seen something in my master <br>that makes me prefer him to everybody else <br>in the world.\" <br>On this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) took Zaid <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) in his lap and said: <br>\"From today, I adopt Zaid as my son.\" <br><br>The father and uncle were quite satisfied with the situation <br>and gladly left Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) with the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and returned without him. <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) was only a child at that time. <br>His preferring to remain a slave, and refusing to go with his <br>own father giving up his home and kith and kin is an ob- <br>vious tribute to his love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). <br>8. \t<br>Anas bin Nadhr's (Radhiyallaho anho) Martyrdom in <br>Uhud. <br>When the Muslims were facing defeat in Uhud, some- <br>body started the rumour that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had been killed. You can imagine the Sahabah's <br>grief and anguish over this tragic news. This, quite natu- <br>rally, caused most of them to lose heart in despair. Anas <br>bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to see 'Umar and <br>Talhah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) with a group of Muslims in <br>a state of utter bewilderment. He said to them: <br>\"Why am I seeing you all so bewildered?\" <br>They said: <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is slain.\" <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) exclaimed: <br>\"Then who will like to live after him? Come, let us go <br>forward with our swords and join o,ur dear Prophet.\" <br>No sooner did he utter these words than hr plunged <br>into the enemy lines and fought till he was martyred. <br>In fact, Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had such an extreme <br>love for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he <br>did not consider this life worth living without him. <br>9. \t<br>Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) Message For The Muslims. <br>During the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) inquired: <br>\"What about Sa'd bin Rabee'? I don't know how things <br>have gone with him.\" <br>One of the Sahabah was despatched to search for him. He <br>went to the spot where the bodies of martyrs lay in heaps. <br>He shouted Sa'd's (Radhiyallaho anho) name to know if he <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>was alive. At one place, while he was announcing that he <br>was deputed by the Prophet to enquire about Sa'd bin <br>Rabee' (Radhiyallaho anho), he heard a feeble'voice coming <br>from one direction. He turned to that direction and found <br>that Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) was lying among the killed <br>and was about to breathe his last. Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was heard saying: <br>\"Convey my Salaam to the Prophet with my message, <br>'0Prophet of Allah! May Allah grant you on my behalf <br>a reward more exalted and more handsome than the <br>one Allah has ever granted a Prophet on behalf of any <br>of his followers, and tell my Muslim brothers, 'Nothing <br>will absolve you from blame, on the Day of Judgement, <br>if the enemy succeeds in reaching the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) before all of you have fallen.\" <br>With these words, Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) drew his last <br>breath and passed into the presence of Allah. <br>As a matter of fact, the Sahabah have given a true proof <br>of their devotion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). While they suffered wound after wound and were on <br>their last breath, they had no complaint nor wish on their <br>lips and could not think of anything else except about the <br>safety and welfare of the Prophet. Would that a sinner like <br>me be blessed with an atom of the love that the Sahabah <br>bore for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>10. A Woman Dies d n  Seeing the Prophet's Grave. <br>A woman. came to Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) and <br>said: <br>\"Take me to the grave of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), so that 1-may be blessed with its sight.\" <br>Aishah (Radhiyallaho anha) opened the room that con-<br>tained the grave of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and let her go inside. The woman on seeing the grave <br>started crying in love and memory of the Prophet. In fact <br>she wept so bitterly and incessantly that she swooned and <br>expired there and then (May Allah bless her). The blessed <br>lady recollected the happy days when the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was alive, and then the pangs of sep- <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>aration proved fatal for her. Can the annals of history <br>produce a parallel to such love and devotion? <br>IC1 <br>11. Sahabah's Love For the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and other Anecdotes. <br>Somebody asked Ali (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"How much was the Sahabah's love for the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>He replied: <br>\"By Allah! To us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was dearer than our riches, our children and our <br>mothers, and was more cherishable than a drink of <br>cold water at the time of severest thirst.\" <br>There is no exaggeration kn Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>statement. As a matter of fact, the Sahabah reached this <br>state because of the perfection of their Iman. It could not be <br>otherwise, in the face of what Allah has enjoined viz: <br>\"Say! If your fathers and your sons and your brethren <br>and your wives and your tribe and the wealth you have <br>acquired and the merchandise, for which you fear that <br>there will be no sale, and the dwellings you desire are <br>dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striv- <br>ing in His way, then wait till Allah bringeth His com- <br>mand to pass. Allah guideth not the wrong-doing<br>folk.\" <br>(IX: 24). <br>This verse sounds a note of warning against anything else <br>becoming more attractive than the love of Allah and that of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) report <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"None of you can be a Mo'min until his love-for me is <br>more than his love for his parents, children and all the <br>people of the marld.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>'Ulama say that the love mentioned in this Hadith and <br>others of its kind is the voluntary love and not instinctive <br>love. If, however, it is taken to mean the natural and in- <br>stinctive love, then the word Mo'min will denote the Iman <br>of the highest degree, for instance that of Sahabah. <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he heard from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). \"There are three <br>things which when found in a person enable him to taste <br>the sweetness of real Iman. These are: <br>(1) When Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) are dearer to him than anything else in <br>this world. <br>(2) \t When his love for anyone is solely for the pleasure <br>of Allah, and <br>(3) \t When turning to 'Kufr' is as abhorrent to him as <br>being flung into the fire.\" <br>12. \t Miscellaneous Stories About Sahabah's Love for the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>(1)'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, you are dearer to me <br>than anybody else in the world except my <br>own self.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"No body can be a perfect Momin until I am <br>dearer to him than even his own self.\" <br>t <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Now you are dearer to me than my own <br>self.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Now, O'Umar.\" <br>The 'Ulama have given two meanings to the conclud- <br>ing words of the Prophet viz: <br>(i) \"Now you have the real Iman.\" <br>(ii) \"Why is it that it is only now that \t I am dearer to <br>you than your own self? This should have been so <br>long ago.\" <br>Suhail Tastari (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"No one can have the relish of Sunnat until he takes <br>1 <br>i <br>I <br>f i <br>I <br>I <br>i <br>I <br>$ 4  <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as his Master <br>arid considers himself his (the Prophet's) slave.\" <br>.f 4<br>s3 <br>(2) A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- * <br>sallam) axid asked: <br>\"When shall be the Day of Judgement? 0, Prophet of <br>Allah!\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"What preparations have you made for that <br>Day?\" <br>The person: \t \"0.Prophet of Allah! 1 do not claim much <br>Salaat, fast and Sadaqah to my credit, but I <br>do have in my heart the love of Allah and <br>that of His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\" <br>The Prophet:' \"On the Day of Judgement, you will surely <br>be with'him whom you love.\" <br>What the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) told the <br>person in this story has also been narrated by several other <br>Sahabah, namely Abdullah bin Mas'ood, Abu Moosa<br>Ash'ari. Safwan. Abu Zar, (Radhiyallaho anhum) etc. <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"Nothing did ever make Sahabah more happy than <br>these words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam).\" <br>They had every reason to be ha py when the love of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasa Plam) had gone deep <br>into every tissue and fibre of their body. <br>(3) In the beginning. Fatimah's (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>house was at some distance from the Prophet's. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to her: <br>\"Would that you were living near me.\" <br>Fatimah: <br>\"Harithah's house is close by. If you ask him to ex- <br>change his house with mine. he will very gladly do it.\" <br>The Prophet: <br>\"He has already exchanged once on my request. I feel<br>shy to request him again.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>But Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) somehow came to know <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) likes Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) to live near him. He at once came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have come to know that you <br>wish Fatimah to live near you. Here are my houses at <br>your disposal. No other house is closer to yours than <br>these. Fatimah can have her house exchanged with any <br>of these. 0,Prophet of Allah, what you accept from me <br>is dearer to me than what you leave for me.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted the <br>offer, saying: <br>\"I know you are quite sincere in what you say\", and <br>gave him his blessings. <br>(4) A person came to the Prophet,[Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than my <br>life, my wealth and my family. When I am at my house <br>and happen to think of you, I become restless till I <br>come and see you. 0,Prophet of Allah, death ismre to <br>come to both of us. After death, you will be in your <br>exalted position as a Prophet, while I shall be some- <br>where else and perhaps I may not be able to see you. I <br>am very anxious and distressed when I think of this <br>separation from you.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this and he did not know what to say; then Jibra'eel <br>(Alayhis Salaam) appeared and revealed the following <br>verse: <br>\"Whoso obeyeth Allah and the Prophet, they are with <br>those unto whom Allah has shown favour among the <br>Prophets and the Saints and the Martyrs and the Right- <br>eous. The best of company are they. Such is the bounty <br>of Allah, and Allah. sufficeth, as knower. (IV: 69 & 70)\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>259 4 A<br>5%<br>These incidents were of frequent occurrence with the Saha- <br>bah. Such fears in the hearts of the lovers are quite natural. <br> fi <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited these <br>verses for their consolation. <br>A person once came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, my love for you is such that <br>when I think of you, I cannot rest till I run to see you, <br>for I am sure I would die if I did not see you. Now I <br>grow very anxious when I imagine that, even if I am <br>able to enter Paradise, it will be very difficult for me to <br>see you, for you will be in a position far above my <br>reach.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) consoled him by <br>reciting the foregoing verses in his reply. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw a person <br>from the Ansar looking very much distressed. He inquired: <br>\"What makes you look so distressed?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Alldh! I have a worry.\" <br>The Prophet: \"What is it?\" <br>The person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! We come to you every morning <br>and evening. We are blessed with your sight and de- <br>lighted to be in your presence. But one day, we will be <br>deprived of your company for you will be placed on <br>heights inaccessible to us.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this, but when the foregoing verses were revealed he <br>sent for that person and gave him the glad tidings con-<br>tained therein. <br>According to another Hadith, a number of Sahabah had <br>expressed similar fears until the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) rec,ited these verses to them, and they were satis- <br>fied. <br>According to another version, the Sahabah once asked <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"The Prophets on account of their ranks will surely be <br>in much higher position than their followers. How will <br>the followers be able to see them?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Those in higher positions will come down to their <br>friends in lower positions to sit with them and talk to <br>them.\" <br>I <br>(5)The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>t <br>i<br>\"Some of my followers coming after me will love me <br>very much. They will wish that they could see me, <br>even if they had to spend their wealth, forego their <br>i <br>families and sacrifice all their possessions for it.\" <br>i <br>! <br>Khalid's daughter Abdah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) says: <br>\"My father while in bed would talk about and remem- <br>ber the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with love <br>and eagerness for him. He would also remember each <br>and every M,uhajir and Ansari (by name) and would <br>say, \"They are my elders and they are my youngers. <br>My heart is eager to meet them. 0 ,  Allah! Call me back <br>l <br>soon, so that I may be able to meet all of them. He <br>would keep on doing this till he would be overtaken <br>by sleep.\" <br>(6) Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the <br>Prophet (Sallbllaho alaihe wasallam): <br>t <br>\"I have a greater wish for your uncle Abu Talib to <br>I <br>come into Islam than for my own father, as I know it <br>i <br>would please you more.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) similarly, once said to 'Abbas <br>(The prophet's uncle): <br>\"I was more pleased at your Islam that at that of my <br>father, for that gave pleasure to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam).\" <br>(7) One night, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was on his <br>security patrol when he saw a light and heard a sound <br>coming from a house. He peeped in to find an old lady <br>spinning wool and singing a few couplets with the follow- <br>ing meaning: <br>\"May Allah accept the prayers Of the pious and the <br>elect.\" <br>\"Seeking blessings for Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>261 s= <br>c. 0 <br>\"0.Allah's Prophet! You worshipped each night. And <br>0 %  <br>.f4<br>you wept before the dawning of each day.\" <br>S m  <br>\"I wish to know if I could be together with my beloved <br>\"A <br>(Prophet).\" <br>\"For death comes in different states (of mind) And I do <br>not know how I shall die.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on hearing these couplets, <br>sat down weeping in love and memory of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>(8)The story of Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is known to <br>all. At the time of his death, his wife sat by his side ex- <br>claiming in excessive grief: <br>\"0,dear! Alas!\" <br>He retorted: \t \"Subhanallah! What a lovely thing it is to die <br>and be able to meet Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and his Sahabah.\" <br>(9) We have already read the story of Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in Chapter V While he stood at the gallows, <br>about to be executed, Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"How would you like it if Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) be killed in your place and you be let <br>off to enjoy life with your family.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"By Allah, it is unbearable for me to sit happily with <br>my family while (even) a thorn is pricking the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>On this, Abu Sufyan remarked: <br>\"There is no parallel anywhere in the world to the love <br>which the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) have for him.\" <br>A note: <br>What is expected of those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? The Ulama have <br>given various answers to this question. Qaadhi Iyaadh <br>writes: <br>\"A lover prefers his beloved above all other things and <br>persons. If this is not the case, the love is not sincere. It</p></div>"

Allah is For- <br>giving, Merciful.\" (111: 31). <br>The Epilogue. <br>The stories given in the previous pages are meant to <br>serve as specimens. In fact a detailed account of Sahabah's <br>lives can not be covered even in big volumes. It is now <br>quite a few months since I started writing this small book. <br>My engagements in Madrasah and other matters needing <br>immediate attention have already delayed this work. I, <br>therefore, propose to finish the book at this stage, so that <br>people may at least benefit from these pages. I have to write <br>an important warning before I close. Just as we are today <br>lacking in our other duties we owe to Islam, so are we very <br>seriously neglectful in our respect and esteem of the Saha- <br>bah. Some negligent people go to the extent of even making <br>adverse remarks against them, We must remember that the <br>Sahabah are those people who laid the foundations of <br>Islam. They are the pioneers in Tabligh. We can never be <br>too grateful to them. May Allah shower His choicest bles- <br>sings on their souls for their efforts in acquiring Islam from <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and handing it <br>down to their successors. I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br><br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation. I-le has again preferred <br>four of my Sahabah over the rest of them. Thev are <br>Abu Bakr. 'Umar, 'Usinan and Ali (Kadhiyallaho <br>aniiurn).\" <br>(8) \"0, people! I am pleased with Abu Bakr.

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t <br><br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the <br>Part I (Hadith 4) <br>second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is superior to <br>a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies <br>a collection, i.e.. one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a <br>she-camel considered together, and likewise every ayat is <br>superior to the combination of an equal number of he-<br>camels or she-camels. Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. When he <br>landed at Jicldah, some of his friends in business requested <br>him to prolo~ig his stav in Jiddah, so that they could earn <br>more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his blesskd <br>presence. In fact thev wanted that some of the servants of <br>the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. At <br>first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay. <br>but when thev insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the <br>maximum profit that they woutd earn for their goods. Thev <br>explained that the profit was r7t the same in all cases; but <br>the maximum that they could expect was hundred per <br>cent. The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>1.9 <br>Iladhrat 'Aa'ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said. <br>\"One who is well versed in the Qilr'an will be in the <br>c:ompanv of those angels who are scrihes, noble and <br>righteous; and one who falters in reading the Qur'an, <br>-<br>and has to exert hard for learning, gets double the <br>reward.\" <br>\"Orie who is well versed in the Qur'an\" means one <br>\\vho is proficierit in riiemorizitlg as well as in reciting it. It <br>is highly praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and sig- <br>nifir:anc:e as well. \"To be with the angels\" means that, like <br>tht? i~ngels who transferred tlie Qur'a~i from the. Lowhul <br>Mahfooz' (Protectetl 'I'ablet in the Heavens), he also (:on- <br>\\lovs it to othors through its recitatioti and, therefore, both <br>Ilave the salnc occupation; or that he will join the company <br>of such angels on the Day of Judgement. One who faltcrs <br>ivill get double reward-olio for his reading and the other <br>tor liis effort in readi~tg the Qur'an, in spite of fitltt?~.i~~g <br>ag,lin atid again. It does liot rnean that liis reward will <br>c:xc.eed that of a well-versed person. The reward tliot is <br>mt:ntioned for a well-versed person is far gleater. so nluc:h <br>so that he ivill be in the company of special angels. 'The ex- <br>plii~iation is that the labour involved in faltering and tlie <br>tlifficllltics in the reading of the Qur'an carry an indeperi- <br>don1 reward. As such, reading of the Qur'ali should not be <br>given up, even though faltering 1lliiv be ail excuse. <br>M ~ ~ I 1 ; ~<br>'Ali Qari has reproduc:t?ci fmm the riwbyat of Ta-<br>broni and Unihaqi that one ~ ~ 1 1 0<br>(:a11110t menlorizt* the <br>(211r'an well and yet persists i l l  loarning it by heart gets <br>doi~blt: reward. Sitnilarly, one who cherishes a longing for <br>111cmorizi.ingit and does not posst!ss the iibilitv to do so, but <br>doc.s not give up his efforts. will t)e reckoned by Almighty <br>hllah atnorig the hl~ffaili! (Plural of hafiz-one who has <br>laarnt !he whole Qur'an hv heart) on the Day of Kesurrec- <br>t ion. <br>$r <br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>the Ulama have translated, by way of metaphor, this word <br>hasad as ghibtah, meaning emulation. Ghibtah is permiss- <br>ible in worldly affairs and commendable in religious mat- <br>ters. <br>The second interpretation is that the term hasad has <br>been used in a hypothetical sense, i.e., if hasad were per- <br>missible it would have been so with regard to the two per- <br>sons mentioned above. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast <br>understanding of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Consider, for example, the citron, which gives flavour to <br>the mouth, cleans the stomach and stimulates digestion. <br>These are the qualities specially associated with the <br>reading of the Qur'an since, fragrance in the mouth. inter- <br>nal purity and spiritual strength result from reading the <br>Qur'an. It is also said that if there is citron in the house, no <br>jinn can enter it. If it is true. then such is the speciality of <br>the Qur'an. Some physicians say that citron strengthens the <br>memory and it is rep'orted in 'Ihya' by Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that three things, i.e., cleaning the teeth <br>with miswak, fasting and reading the Holy Qur'an <br>strengthen the memory. <br>i <br>In the book of Abu Dawood, it is mentioned at the con- <br>clusion of the hadith given above that a good companion is <br>like a person having musk. Even if vou do not get musk, <br>you will at least enloy its fragrance. An evil companion is <br>like a person with a furnace, near whom, even if you do not <br>get blac:kened, vou certainly cannot avoid the smoke. It is, <br>/i<br>therefore. important that one should be very careful in <br>choosing his companions, with whom he has to mix gener- <br>I <br>ally. <br>i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"He misleads many by this Book and guides many <br>thereby.\" <br>At another place we come across: <br>\"And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a <br>healing and mercy for believers, though it increases for <br>the evil-doers naught save ruin.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re- <br>ported to have said: \"Many hypocrites of this Ummat will <br>be the qurraa, i.e., those who recite the Qur'an correctly.\" <br>In 'Ihya-ul-Ulum' it is reported ffom some Mashaa'ikh. \"As <br>soon as a man starts reading a surah (chapter of the Holy <br>Qur'an), the Angels start invoking mercy for him and they <br>continue to do so till he stops reading; on the contrary an- <br>other person starts reading a surah and the Angels start <br>cursing him and they continue to do so till he completes <br>the reading.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that sometimes a man reads <br>the Holy Qur'an and invokes curses on himself without <br>even knowing it. For instance, he reads in the Holy Qur'an: <br>Virtues of the Htdy Qur'an <br>\"Beware, the curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers\" <br>and he exposes himself to this warning because of his wrong- <br>doings. <br>In the like manner, he reads in the Qur'an: <br>\"The curse of Allah is upon the liars\". <br>In fact he exposes himself to the warning by reason of <br>his being himself a liar. <br>'Aamir ibn Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) say$ that <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhivallaho anho) had appointed Naafi' <br>ibn Abdul Harith as the Governor of Mecca. Once he asked <br>the latter as to whom he had appointed as the administra- <br>tor of forests. \"Ibn Abzi\" replied Naafi'. \"Who is Ibn-e- <br>Abzi?\" said Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). \"He is <br>one of our slaves\" was the reply. \"Why have you appointed <br>a slave the ameer (leader)?\" objected Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho an\\ho). \"Because he recites the Book of Allah\" <br>said Naafi'. At this, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrated the hadith that it had been said by Rasullullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that, because of this Book. <br>Allah elevates many people and degrades many. <br>Hadhrat 'Abdur Rahman ibn 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \",On the Day of Judgement, three things will be <br>under the shade of the Arsh (Allah's Throne). One, the <br>Holy Qur'an which will argue with men-the Qur'an <br>has both an exterior and an interior. The second will <br>b <br>i <br>1t <br>! \t<br>E <br>I i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  \t<br>be amaanat (trust). The third will be kinship, which <br>shall proclaim, '0. Allah! have mercy wn the person <br>who upheld me. and deprive him of Your merry who- <br>soever severed me.' \" <br>\"Three things will be under the shade of the 'Arsh\" <br>signifies their utmost nearness in the sublime preserlce of <br>Allah. \"The Qur'an will argue\" nieans that it will pleacl tht: <br>cause of those people who read it, respect it and act upon <br>its commandments. It will intercede on their behalf and <br>solicit the upgrading of their rank. Mulla 'Ali Qari has tiar- <br>rated on the authority of 'Tirmizi' (a book of Hadith) that. <br>in the presence of Almighty Allah, the Holy Qur'iin will <br>beg Allah to grant an apparel to its reader. Almightv Allah <br>will give him a crown of honour. The Qur'an will again beg <br>for additional favoitrs for him. Thereupon Alrnighlv All;th <br>will award the reader a complete robe of honour. 'I'llu <br>Qur'an will again beseech Allah to be pleased with him. <br>and Almighty Allah will express His pleasure to him. <br>We find in this life that the pleasure of the belovt:d is <br>considered to be the most coveted gift. Similarly ill the life <br>Hereafter, no bountv shall stand comparison with the <br>pleasure of our ljeloved Alnlighty Allah. And in c a w  of <br>those who ignore their duty towards the Qur'an. it will <br>challenge them saving, \"Did you care for me'? Ilid vou fullil <br>your obligations towards me?\" <br>It has been reported on the authority of Irnnrn Abu <br>Hariifa (Rahn~atullah alaih) in 'Ihya' that it is the clue right <br>of the Qur'an that it should be read completely tu' <br>,I<br>year. Those of us who never care to reaci the Qur'an shoultl <br>first consider how they will defend themselves agilir~st <br>such a strong plaintiff. Death is inevitable and thew (:an l)e <br>no escape from it. <br>The meaning of the expression \"exterior and interior of <br>the Qur'an\" is evident. The Qur'an has an apparcxlt mean- <br>ing which can be understood by all. but the doepcr spiri- <br>tual significance is not understood by everybody. It is in <br>this connection that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said: \"Whosoever expresses his personal opinion <br>in respect of anything .in the dur'an commits <br>niistake. <br>even if he be right in his opinion.\" <br>Some scholars hold that the word 'exterior'. refers to <br>its words, which can be recited properlv by evervbodv and <br>the word 'interior', i.e., spirit, refers to its n~eanings. and its <br>underlying ideas, the understanding of which varies with <br>the ability of the readers. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If vou <br>seek knowledge, you should meditate on the meanings of <br>I <br>the Qur'an, because it embodies the history of former as <br>well as of latter times.\" It is, however, essential to observe <br>the pre-requisites for interpreting the Qur'an. An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word <br>has several meanings. A person may be knowing <br>only one or two of them, though in a given context <br>the gctual meaning may be quite different.\" <br>(2) \t Nahw, i.e., syntax, a branch of grammar. w11ic:h <br>helps in understanding the relation of a sentence <br>with another and also of I'raab (vowel sounds) of <br>the letters of a word. A change in I'raab often <br>means a change in the meaning. <br>(3) Sarf. i.e., et$mology, a branch of grammar, which <br>helps in knowing the root words and conjugations. <br>The moaning of a word changes with the change in <br>the root and with a change in its conjugation. <br>Ibri Faris (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One who loses the <br>knowledge of etymology loses a great deal.\" 'Allamah <br>Zamakhshari (Rahmatullah alaih) mentions that, when a <br>certain person set to translate the ayat- <br>On the day that We shall call each and every people <br>after their leader, <br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta- <br>phors become known. <br>(7) \t llrnul Badee', i.e., knowledge of rhetoric, the <br>knowledge which reveals the beauty of language <br>and its implications. <br>The last three are the branches of Ilmul Balaaghah <br>(knowledge of oratory), clnd are considered very important <br>subjects, which a cornmelltator should master, because the <br>Glorious Qur'an is a perfect miracle and its amazing con- <br>structions can only be understood after mastering these <br>subjects. <br>(8) \t llmul Qirrta'ah, i.e., knowledge of the art of pro- <br>nunciation. because different methods of recita-<br>ti011 sc~metimes convey different meanings, anci <br>so~nekimesone meaning is to be preferred over the <br>other. <br>(9) \t IlmuJ Aqaa'id, i.e.,knowledge of the fundamentals <br>of faith. This is necessarv to explain certain ana- <br>logies. The literal meaning of certain ayaat refer- <br>ring to Almighty Allah is not the correct one. For <br>example, the analogy in the ayat-- <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>(The hand of Allah is over their hands) <br>will have to be explained because Allah has no physical <br>hands. <br>(10)Usoolul Fiqh i.e., Prin~iples of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence. These are necessary for reasoning out and <br>finding arguments in the basic support of state-<br>ments. <br>(11)Asbaabun Nuzool, i.e., the particular circum-<br>stances which caused revelation. The meaning of <br>an ayat will be better understood if we know how <br>arid when it had been revealed. Someti~nes the <br>true meaning of an ayat is understood only if we <br>know the circumstances in which the ayat had <br>been revealed. <br>(12)An Naasikh wal Mansookh, i.e., knowledge of <br>commandments that have subsequently been abro- <br>gated or changed. so that abrogated command-<br>ments may be distinguished from the standing <br>ones. <br>(13)IImul Fiqh, i.e., knowledge of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence, because it is only through this knowledge <br>that' we arrive at a complete understanding of gen- <br>eral principles. <br>(14)Knowledge of such ahadith that happen to be com- <br>mentary on cerfain brief verses of the Qur'an. <br>(15)The last but most important is the Wahbi ilm, or <br>the gifted understanding, bestowed by Almighty <br>Allah upon Ilis selected ones, as is referred in the <br>hadith-<br>Whosoever acts upon what he knows, Almighty Allah <br>bestows upon him the knowledge of things not known <br>to him. <br>. <br>It is this special understanding that was implied in the <br>reply of Hadhrat 'Ali (Karramallaahu wajhahu) (may Allah <br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe-wasallam). <br>Allamah Suyuti says that those who think that it is <br>beyond the capacity of a man to acquire Wahbi ilm, or <br>gifted understanding, are not right. To get this k~iowledge <br>from Allah, one should adopt the means to this end, e.g., <br>acting upon the kllowledge that one has acquired, and dis- <br>inclination towards the world. <br>It is stated in 'Keemiyaa-e-Sa'aadat' that three persons <br>are not blessed with complete understanding of the Qur'an. <br>First, one who is not well versed in Arabic, seco~ldly, one <br>who persists in committing a major sin or indulges in act of <br>religious innovation, because these actions blacken his <br>heart, which in turn prevents him from understanding the <br>Qur'an. Thirdly, one who is a rationalist, even in the niatter <br>of faith, and feels enibarassed when he reads an ayat of the <br>Qur'a~i which he is not able to fully rationalize. <br>May Allah protect us from all such sins and evils. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>there is a tradition in Musnad Ahmad- <br>Till he reads of whatever Qur'an is with him. <br>This word more clearly refers to a hafiz, although a <br>reader who remains very often engaged in reciting the <br>Qur'an inay also be implied. <br>It is written in ' ~ i 6 a a t '  <br>that this hadith does not apply <br>to a reader who is accursed by the Qur'an. This is with re- <br>ference to the hadith that there are many readers of the <br>Qur'an who read the Qur'an but the Qur'an invokes curses <br>upon them. Therefore, the reading of Qur'an by a person <br>who does not adhere to the correct tenets does not consti- <br>tutc ar! argument that he is acceptable to Allah. Many Aha- <br>dith of this type relate to the Khawarij (a sect who were <br>opposed to Hadhrat 'Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>In this conimentary, Shah Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) has written that 'tarteel' literally means reading with <br>good and clear pronunciation, while according to Islamic <br>pri~ciplesit means reading in accordance with certain <br>rdes as follows: <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the <br>liver likes sweet things. Therefore, if a perfume is used at <br>the time of recitation, it will have a better influence on the <br>heart. <br>(6) Tashdeed ( (5) ) (doubling of letters) and madd ( (3) ) <br>(prolongation of letters) should be fully pro-<br>nounced because this reveals the grandeur of the <br>Qur'an and adds to its effectiveness. <br>(7) \t As stated earlier, the reader's heart should respond <br>to the ayat indicating mercy of Allah or chastise- <br>ment by Him. <br>The aboce-me~~tioned <br>seven rules constitute the cor- <br>rect way of reciting the Qur'an, which is called tarteel, and <br>the sole object of all this is to reach the correct understand- <br>ing and grasp of the deeper meaning of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Hadhrat Umm-e-Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>once askecl by someone as to how Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>aleihe wasallam) used to recite Qur'an. She said, \"In a way <br>that all vowel sounds were clear and the pronunciation of <br>each letter was distinct.\" It is desirable to recite the Qur'an <br>with propriety even if one may not understand the mean- <br>ing. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that he preferred <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari- <br>ously reported'to be 204,14,19,25,36. <br>It is written in 'Sharhul-Ihya' that each ayat corre-<br>sponds to a higher level in Paradise. So a reader will be <br>asked to ascend according to his recitation. One who reads <br>the whole of the Qur'an will attain the highest level in Par- <br>adise. And one who knows only a part of the Qur'an will <br>rise up to the proportionate level. In brief, the stage or level <br>reached will be fixed by the number of ayaat recited. <br>According to my understanding, the above hadith has <br>a different meaning- <br>(If my interpretation is corect, it is from Allah and, if it <br>is wrong, it is from me and from Satan, and Allah and <br>His Prophet are free from it.) <br>I think that the elevation implied in this hadith is not <br>that which can be determined by the number of ayat to be <br>recited. i.e., when one ayat be recited, the status will be <br>raised by one step, whether it be read with propriety or <br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says: <br>0' Shaheedi! His bounties are common for all, You <br>could not be denied [these bounties), if you were all <br>worthy. <br>HADITH 10 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever reads one letter of the Rook of Allah is credited <br>with one blessing and one blessing is equal to~~enfold <br>the like thereof in its reward. 1 do not say that @Jl(Alif <br>Laam Meem) is one letter, but ' (9' (alif) is one letter, ' (J, <br>'(laam) is one letter, and '(r)' (meem) is one letter.\" <br>The hadith affirms that whereas, ordinarily for the pur- <br>pose of reward an act as a whole is taken into account but <br>in the case of Qur'an it is not so, parts also count. Thus, in <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings. There is a differeilce of opinion anlong scholars <br>whether 'dl'(alif, laam, meem) is the beginning of Surah <br>Baqarah or of Surah Feel. If it is the beginning of Surah Ba- <br>qarah, and only three letters are counted, as they are writ- <br>ten, then the blessings wi!l be thirty. And if it is the <br>beginning of Surah Feel, then ' ( I ) '  (alif),'(3)'(laam) and '(f)' <br>(meem). which is the beginning of Surah Eaqarah will be <br>nine letters. Therefore, its reward will be ninety blessings. <br>Baihaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported another <br>hadith similar to this portion of the above-mentioned <br>hadith, viz.. \"I do nolt say that '(Ale)' <br>(Bismillah) is one <br>letter, but uphold that '(d)' (ha) '(,.I)' <br>(sin) and '(9'(meem), <br>etc, are separate letters.\" <br>HADITH- 11 <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz Juhani (Radhiyallaho anho) reports <br>that Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. <br>Part I (Hadith 11) <br>\"Whoever reads the Qur'an and acts upon what is con- <br>tained in it, his parents will be made to wear a crown <br>on the Day of Judgement, the brilliance of which will <br>excel that of the sun, if the same were within your <br>wordly houses. So, what do you think about the person <br>4 I ,<br>Zi,<br>who himself acts upon it?\" <br>Thus, it is through the virtues of his reading the Qur'an <br>.-<br>W<br>W<br> <br>+<br>and acting upon it that the parents of the leader will be <br>a-x <br>honoured with a crown, the brilliance of which will far <br>excel the light of the sun even if the sun were within one's <br>own house. The sun is at a great distance from us and even <br>then its light is so bright. If the sun comes down into one's <br>house, its light and brilliance will surely increase mani- <br>fold. The light of the crown to be worn by the parents of <br>the reader will be still more brilliant. When this is in $tore <br>for the parents, what will be the reward of the reader him- <br>self? Surely if the beneficiaries get so much, the reward of <br>the person who is the real cause should be much more. The <br>parents get this reward solely because they were the cause <br>of the reader coming into being, or were responsible for his <br>education. <br>In addition to the fact that the light of the sun will he <br>far greater if it were in one's own house, this simile implies <br>yet another delicate point. Attachment and liking for a <br>thing increase when it always remains with a person. <br>Therefore, the feeling of strangeness for the sun due to dis- <br>tance will give place to attachment, because of its close <br>nearness all the time. Thus, in addition to describing the <br>brilliance of the crown, the hadith implies this attachment <br>with the crown and also the great satisfaction that it be- <br>longs to oneself. Everybody gets benefited by the sun, but if <br>it were to be given entirely to a person, how very proud he <br>would feel. <br>Haakim (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported from Burai- <br>dah, (Radhiyallaho anho) saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam); \"One who recites the Qur'an and acts <br>upon it will be made to wear a crown woven with noor, <br>and his parents will be made to wear garments, which will <br>be more valuable than the entire world. They will say, <br>'Almighty Allah! what is it that we are being given these <br>garments for?' 'In lieu of the reading of Qur'an by your <br>child', will be the reply.\" <br>It is given in Jam'ul Fawaa'id by Tabrani (Rahmatullah <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>alaih) that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had reported <br>the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Whoever teaches the reading of Qur'an to his son (without <br>memorizing it), all his sins, whether previous or subse-<br>quent, will be forgiven; and whoever makes his child mem- <br>orize the Qur'an will be raised on the Day of Judgement in <br>the semblance of a full moon; and his son will be asked to <br>start reciting, and for every ayat read by the child, the <br>status of the parent will be raised to the next higher grade <br>of jannat, till the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is com- <br>pleted.\" <br>Such are the blessings for teaching the Qur'an to your <br>children. This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on <br>iour shoulders a very heavy accountability. The hadith <br>that-<br>Each one of you is a guardian, and will be questioned <br>about those under his control <br>means that everyone s,hall be questioned about his subordi- <br>nates and dependents as to what extent he taught (deen) to <br>them. Surely one should guard himself and his dependents <br>against these shortcomings. But (as the proverb goes) <br>\"should one discard clothes for fear of lice?\" Nav, one <br>should surely try to keep his clothes clean. If you impart <br>religious education to your child, you will be free from <br>vour responsibilities. As long as the child lives, and what- <br>ever good deed he does and salad he performs and forgive- <br>ness that he seeks from Allah for you, will elevate your <br>position in Paradise. If for the sake of this life and for the <br>lust of a few coppers, you keep him ignorant of (deen), not <br>only wiil you have to suffer for this misdeed but whatever <br>evil and misdeeds he does. your account will not be free <br>from their burden. For God's sake, have pity on yourselves. <br>This life is only a passing phase and death will put an end <br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica- <br>tion of the hadith is general arid not confined to any par- <br>ticular period. It means that if any hafiz of Qur'an were cast <br>in due to any crime on his part, the fire of Hell will not <br>affect him. In another hadith it is said that the fire will not <br>even touch him. The second interpretation of the above- <br>mentioned hadith is also supported by another hadith re- <br>ported by Abu Umaamah (Radhiyallaho anho) and also <br>given in the book Sharhus Sunnah, by Mulla Ali Qari, <br>which says, \"Learn the Qur'an by heart, because Almighty <br>Allah does not punish the heart which contains the <br>Qur'an .\" In its meanings this hadith is clear and confirmed <br>by the Qur'an. Those who regard memorizing the Qur'an as <br>useless should, for God's sake, ponder over these merits. <br>The last-mentioned one alone should prompt everybody to <br>dedicate his life to learning the Qur'an by heart, because <br>there is no one who has not committed sins and does not <br>deserve the fire of Hell. <br>In Sharhul Ihya there is a list of those people who wiil <br>rest in the shade of Allah's mercy (protection) on the hor- <br>rible Day of Judgement. It is mentioned therein that. <br>according to a hadith reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) by Dailami that the custodians of Qur'an, in <br>other words those who learn the Qur'an by heart, will be in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell.\" <br>By the grace of Allah, entry into Jannat is ensured for <br>every believer though it may come after his being punished <br>for his misdeeds. The hafiz will, however, be favoured with <br>this entry right from the beginning. The ten persons in <br>whose favour his intercession will be accepted will be <br>those sinful and disobedient Muslims who are guilty of <br>major sins. There can be no intercession, however, for the <br>unbelievers. Almighty Allah has said: <br>Whosoever ascribes partners unto Allah, for him Allah <br>has forbidden Jannat, and their place is Hell - and for <br>evil-doers there will be none amongst the helpers. <br>It is also said in the Qur'an: <br>The Prophet and the believers are not allowed to pray <br>for the forgiveness of 'mushrikin' (Plural of mushrik, <br>one who ascribes partners unto Allah) the polytheists <br>even if they are their relatives. <br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Learn the Qur'an and recite it, because the example of <br>one who learns the Qur'an, reads it and recites it in Ta- <br>hajjud (salaat late after midnight) is like an open bag <br>full of musk, the fragrance whereof spreads over the <br>entire place, and a person who has learnt the Qur'an <br>but sleeps while the Qur'an is in his heart, is like a bag <br>full of musk but with its mouth closed.\" <br>It means that the example of one who learns the Quran and <br>cares for it and recites it in Tahajjud salaat is like that of a <br>musk-container which, if opened, fills the whole house <br>with its sweet smell. In the same way, the entire house is <br>lit up with divine light and blessings due to the recitation <br>by the hafiz. Even if the hafiz remains asleep or does not <br>recite through his negligence, the Qur'an in his heart is in <br>any case the musk. This negligence resulted in the loss that <br>others were deprived of the blessings of Qur'an, but his <br>heart does, in any case, contain the musk of Qur'an. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In <br>the house where the Qur'an is read, the household mem- <br>bers increase, virtues and blessings multiply, angels de- <br>scend upon them and Satan quits the house. Whereas the <br>house in which Qur'an is not recited, life therein becomes <br>straitened and devoid of blessings, angels leave the house <br>and Satan ravages it.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) and some <br>others have reported Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to have said thdt a deserted house is one in which the <br>Holy Qur'an is not recited. <br>HADITH- 16 <br>*.<br>iwl dig\\ii13<br>~d & 2\\ @ <br>&j @G 2 (1,) <br>, , <br>o f  <br>@j <br>@&j\\ 23 @ .I$\\ ikIj,!*,23 +Tg\\!;\\,j> p\\ <br>I <br>0 ,  <br>I. d ,  <br>e>\\ <br>2 ,J&1 u&J\\, &j\\ 2 &i +I, <br>&\\,@\\ <br>,* C*, <br>8 . 5  <br>cJ dl <br>,y e fCpj <br>Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says that Rasu- <br>lpllah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Recitation of <br><br>2.3 <br>Part I (Hadith 17) <br>the Qur'an in salaat is more rewarding than the recita- <br>tion outside salaat; recitation outside salaat is prefer- <br>able to tasbeeh and takbeer (repeating words of Praise <br>for Allah); tasbeeh is superior to sadaqah (alms); sada- <br>= <br>qah to sowm (fasting) and sowm is protection against <br>Fire.\" <br>o L <br>The superiority of recitation of the Qur'an over zikr $? <br>(glorification and remembrance of Allah) is evident be- 5~ <br>cause Qur'an is the Word oi Allah. As mentioned earlier, <br>the superiority of the Word of Allah over the speech of <br>others is like His superiority over His creation. The superi- <br>ority of zikr over sadaqah has been stressed in other aha- <br>dith as well. But the superiority of sadaqah over sowm as <br>given in this hadith, seems contrary to that given in some <br>other ahadith where sowm is said to be better than sada- <br>qah.' This difference is due to the variations in the type of <br>people and their conditions of life. <br>According to this hadith sowm comes last in the order <br>of merit. When sowm is protection against the Fire of Hell, <br>we can imagine numerous blessing of the recitation of <br>Qur 'an. <br>The author of 'Ihya' reports on the authority of Hadh- <br>rat' Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that for every letter recited <br>there are hundred blessings for one who reads the Qur'an <br>while standing in salaat, fifty blessings for one who reads <br>while sitting in salaat, twenty-five blessings for one who <br>reads in the state of wudhu outside salaat, ten blessings for <br>one who reads without wudhu, and one blessing for him <br>who does not read himself but listens eagerly to the reader. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: \"Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked us. 'Does <br>any one of you like that when he returns homc, ht? <br>should find three she-camels, pregnant and fat.' We <br>said, 'We would love to do so.' Then Rasulullah (Sal-<br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Three ayaat which one <br>of you may recite in his salaat are better than three big <br>pregnant and fat she-camels.\" <br>A similar subject-matter has been described in hadith <br>3. In this hadith there is a reference to recitation of the <br>Qur'an inside salaat which is more virtuous than recitation <br>outside salaat. That is why a comparison has been made to <br>pregnant she-camels. Because, just as in one case, there is a <br>reference to two virtues, that is salaat and recitation, in the <br>other case there is a reference to two things that is a she- <br>camel and her pregnancy. It has been mentioned under <br>hadith 3 that ahadith of this kind are only for the purpose <br>of a simile, otherwise the everlasting reward of one ayat is <br>more valuable than thousands of mortal she-camels. <br>HADITH- 18 <br>Hazrat Uthman bin Abdullah bin Aus Thaqafi (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhum) narrates from his grand-father that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Reciting <br>the Qur'an from memory carries one thousand degrees <br>of spiritual reward, while reading the Qur'an from the <br>i <br>Book increases it,up to two thousand degrees.\" <br>Many virtues of being a hafiz have been mentioned <br>before. In this hadith, however, preference is shown to <br>reading from the Holy Book as compared to reciting it from <br>memory, because reading from the Book is not only condu- <br>cive to deeper understanding and meditation but also in- <br>cludes several other devotional acts, such as looking into <br>I <br>the Qur'an and touching it, etc. The difference in the ap- <br>parent meanings of the various ahadith has led to a differ- <br>ence of opinion among the scholars of hadith as to whether <br>reading from the Holy Book is better than reciting it from <br>memory. By reason of the above hadith, and because <br>reading from the Book safeguards against making mistakes <br>and includes the virtuous act of looking at the Holy Book, <br>some scholars give preference to reading by looking into <br><br>Part I (Hadith 19) <br>the Book. By reason of other ahadith, and because reciting <br>from memory is conducive to greater devotion and is free <br>from riyaa' (dissimulation) and because this was the way of <br>recitation of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self, some scholars consider that reciting from memory is $-3<br>preferable. Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) has decided <br>0 2 <br>that the preference between the two depends upon the in- <br>dividuals. Some people concentrate and meditate better <br>Z Q<br>T x<br>while reading from the Book, while others do so, reciting <br>from memory. Therefore, reading from the Book is prefer- <br>able for some and reciting from memory for others. Hafiz <br>Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah alaih) also has favoured this inter- <br>pretation in his book 'Fat-hul Baari.' <br>It is said that on account of excessive reading by Hadh- <br>rat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) two scripts of the Holy <br>Qur'an tore. Amr ibn Maimoon (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>mentioned in 'Sharhul Ihya', that one who opens the Holy <br>Qur'an after Fajr (dawn) salaat and reads a hundred ayaat <br>gets a reward as large as the entire world. Reading the <br>Qur'an by looking into it is reported to be beneficial for <br>eyesight. Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated a lengthy hadith in which each reporter says that <br>he had some trouble with his eyes and that his teacher <br>bade him to recite the Qur'an by looking into it. Hadhrat <br>Imaam Shaafi'ee, (Rahmatullah alaih) often used to open <br>the Qur'an after Ishaa (night) salaat and close it only a little <br>before Fajr salaat.' <br>HADITH- 19 <br>Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anhuma) narrated: <br>\"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The <br>hearts get rusted as does iron with water. When some- <br>one asked, \"What could cleanse he~rts again?' Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Frequent <br>remembrance of death and recitation of Qur'an.\" <br>Excess of sins and negligence in the remembrance of <br>Allah cause the hearts to rust, as water causes iron to rust. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>The reading of Qur'an and the remembrance of death <br>polish the rusted hearts. The heart is like a mirror. If it is <br>not cleaned, it will not properly reflect the recognition of <br>Allah. The more burnished and brighter it is, the better will <br>it show from the enlightenment. Therefore, the more we in- <br>dulge in sinful lust and devilish acts, the more are we de- <br>prived of the recognition of Almighty Allah. It is with a <br>view to polishing the mirror of the heart that mashaa'ikh <br>enjoin upon their disciples to devote themselves to self-dis- <br>cipline endeavours, spiritual occupation, incantation and <br>remembrance of Allah. <br>It is mentioned in some ahadith that when a man com- <br>mits a sin, a black dot stains his heart. If he repents in real <br>earnest, this dot is removed, but if he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears. In this way, if he goes on com- <br>mitting sin after sin, his heart gets completely blackened. <br>At this stage the heart becomes quite disinclined to do <br>good!, and keeps on turning to evil. <br>May Allah save us from such a stage. <br>\"Verily their evil deeds have covered their hearts with <br>rust\" refers to this blackening of the heart. <br>According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said, \"I leave two 'wu'aaz' (plural of <br>waa'iz-preacher)-one <br>speaking and the other silent. That <br>which speaks is the Holy Qur'an and that which is silent is <br>the remembrance of death.\" <br>Certainly the words of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) are worthy of loving acceptance. But only those <br>who take proper heed derive benefit from a sermon. On the <br>other hand, if we consider deen itself as being a useless oc- <br>cupation and an obstacle in the way of material progress, <br>we will neither feel the need of spiritual advice nor act <br>upon it. <br>Hadhrat I-Iasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"People <br>.of earlier times believed the Holy Qur'an to be the Com- <br>mandment of Allah, they contemplated over it throughout <br>the night and acted upon it during the day. Whereas today <br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 20) <br>you exercise particular care to pronounce its words and <br>vowels correctly, but do not take it as the Commandment of <br>Allah, and do not contemplate over it.\" <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Certainly <br>there is always a thing in which people take pride. <br>And that which is glory and pride for my Umlnat is the <br>Holy Qur'an.\" <br>People indicate their nobility and dignity by virtue of <br>their lineage, their familv and other similar things. ?'he <br>Qur'an is the source of nobility and pride for the Ummat in <br>the sense that reading, memorizing and teaching it, as also <br>acting upon it; in short, everything related to it, confers an <br>honour upon them. Why should it not be so? After all, it is <br>the Word of the Beloved and the Commandment of the <br>Master. Its dignity excels all worldly honours, however <br>great. The achievements of this worldly life, however <br>splendid vanish sooner or later, while the splelldour and <br>dignity of the Qur'an is eternal and unbounded. <br>Even the minor attributes of the Glorious Qur'an are <br>such as we should be proud of, let alone its excellence in <br>other respects, for example, its beautiful composition, won- <br>derful coherence, the right choice of words, the proper de- <br>velopment of arguments, the narration of past events and <br>prophecies about the future. Its assailing remarks concern- <br>ing other people are such as cannot be contradicted, e.g., <br>the remark about the Jews, that they profess their love for <br>Allah, but they never long for death. The listener is im- <br>pressed by its recitation and the reader never gets tired of <br>reading it. It is usual that, however lovely a discorirse may <br>be, it may even be a letter from a beloved who has made <br>one mad: we will become tireti of reading it for the twen- <br>tieth time if not the tenth: or the fortieth time, if not the <br>twentieth. On the other hand, if we just memorize one sec- <br>tion of the Qur'an, one may read it two hundred times or <br>four hundred times or go on doing so for the whole life. but <br>one shall never lose interest. And if something prevents us <br>from enjoying it, that will be for a while only. In fact, the <br>more we read the Qur'an, the greater will be our enjoyment <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>and satisfaction. Even if a few of the above excellent quali- <br>ties were to be found in any composition, we would be all <br>praise for it. So, if all these qualities were present in a com- <br>position to a perfect degree, surely it would have to be re- <br>garded with the greatest honour and pride. <br>Now, we should just reflect on our own condition. <br>How many of us feel really proud of having memorized the <br>whole Qur'an? Does a hafiz command real respect in our <br>eyes? Alas! our honour and pride lie in high university de- <br>grees, in big titles, in worldly pomp and show, and in the <br>wealth which we will have to leave behind us on our <br>death. 0,Allah! have mercy up011 us. <br>HADITH- 21 <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he re- <br>quested Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give <br>him some lasting advice. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Cultivate the fear and reverence of <br>Allah in your heart, because this is the root of all virtu- <br>ous deeds.\" I asked him to add something more and he <br>said, \"Stick to the reading of the Qur'an, because it is a <br>noor in this life and a provision for the Hereafter.\" <br>The fear of Allah is the root of all good actions. A man <br>whose heart is filled with fear of Allah, does neither <br>commit any sin nor experience any difficulty. <br>Whoever fears Allah, Allah will make a way for him <br>out of every difficulty and provide from whence he has <br>no expectation. <br>Some of the foregoing traditions also disclose that the <br>Qur'an is illuminating. In Sharahul Ihya, Hadhrat Abu <br>Na'eem (Rahmatullah alaih] states that Hadhrat Baasit <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) has reported from Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) that the houses in which the Holy <br><br>Part I (Hadith 21) <br>Qur'an is read shine unto the inhabitants of the Heaven as <br>do the stars shine unto the inhabitants of the Earth. <br>This hadith, which has been quoted from 'At-Targhib', <br>is only a part of a long hadith reported from Ibn Hibban by <br>Mulla Ali Qari in detail and by Suyuti in brief. Although :<br>P <br>the above-mentioned part of the hadith is sufficient for the <br>purpose of this book. yet the whole hadith includes many <br>essential and useful subjects and, therefore, its subject- - . P<br>matter is given in the following paragraphs. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anha) says that he in- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallamj about <br>the number of books revealed by Almighty Allah. Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"One hundred <br>booklets and four books. Fifty booklets were revealed to <br>Hadhrat Sheeth (Alaihis salaam) (peace be upon him), <br>thirty to Hadhrat Idrees (Alaihis salaam), ten to Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam) and ten to Hadhrat Musa (Alaihis <br>salaam) before the Torah. In addition. four books, i.e., the <br>Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Holy Qur'an have <br>been revealed by Almighty Allah.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) enquired about the contents of the booklets <br>revealed to Hadhrat Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam). Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied that they consisted of <br>proverbs, e.g., \"0,you strong and proud king! I did not ap- <br>point you to hoard wealth, but to prevent the complaint of <br>the oppressed from reaching me by redressing it before- <br>hand, because I do not reject the complaint of the op- <br>pressed person, even though he may be a disbeliever.\" <br>The author states that whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) deputed any of his Companions as an <br>ameer or governor, in addition to giving other advice, he <br>used to emphasize: <br>Beware of the invocation of the oppressed because be- <br>tween him and Allah there is no veil or intermediary. <br>As a Persian verse goes: <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>\"Beware of the sigh of those oppressed, when they <br>Pray 9 <br>Divine acceptance readily greets them. <br>These booklets also mentioned that it is incumbent on <br>a wise man, unless he is deprived of sanity, to divide his <br>time in three parts: one for worship of his Lord; one for <br>self-reckoning to consider what acts, good or bad, he did <br>and one for his lawful earning of livelihood. It is also in- <br>cumbent upon him to watch of his time and be thoughtful <br>about improving his conditions and to guard his tongue <br>against unnecessary and useless talk. Whoever keeps a <br>check on his own speech, his tongue will indulge less in <br>useless talk. <br>Also, a wise man should not travel except for three <br>purposes. viz., for making provision for the life Hereafter, <br>or in search of livelihood, or for such recreation as is per- <br>missible. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) then enquired <br>about the contents of the booklets revealed to Hadhrat <br>Musa (Alaihis salaam). Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said, \"They contained monitions only, such as 'I am <br>astonished by one who finds pleasures in anything in spite <br>of his faith in the certainty of death.' (Naturally when a <br>person becomes sure of his sentence of hanging, and <br>mounting the gallows, he can never find pleasure in any- <br>thing). 'I am astonished by one who laughs in spite of his <br>faith in certainty of death'. 'I arn astonished by one who ob- <br>serves accidents, changes and revolutions of the world all <br>the time, and still finds satisfaction in it.' 'I am astonished <br>by one who believes in predestination, still suffers from <br>grief and hardship.' 'I am astonished by one who believes <br>that he will soon be required to render an account and still <br>does no good deed.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) goes on saying <br>that he asked for more advice. Rasulullah (Sallailaho alaihe <br>wasallam) advised that he should cultivate fear of Allah, <br>because it is the root and basis of all spiritual actions. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Kadhivdllaho anho) then begged for more <br>advice. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallaln) said, \"Be <br>consistent in recitation of Qur'an and remembrance of <br>Allah, because it is a noor in this world and a provision in <br>Heaven.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhivallaho anho) again <br>sought further advice and was told. \"Abstain from too <br><br>Part I (Hadith 22) <br>much of laughter, because it causes the heart to wither, and <br>the face loses its lustre.\" (Too much of laughter is injurious <br>both for the outward and inward disposition of man.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) sought further <br>S <br>advice, whereupon Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) -: <br>said, \"Stick to jihaad because this is the rahbaaniyyat of my <br>g 6 <br>ummat.\" (Rahbaan - singular raahib - were those people of <br>.!> x<br>previous ~ ~ ~ n m a t s  <br>who severed all their worldly connec-<br>tions and turned towards Allah.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked for more <br>advice and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Associate yourself with the poor and the needy, be <br>friendly with them and sit in their company.\" When Hadh- <br>rat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) requested further advice, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Look to-<br>wards those who rank below you (so that you may get used <br>to being thankful) and do not look at those who rank above <br>you, lest you should despise the favours of Allah upon <br>you.\" <br>When Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>asked for more advice, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said, \"Let your own faults prevent you from criticiz- <br>ing others and do not try to find fault with others, because <br>you commit those faults yourself. It is enough to prove you <br>guilty that you should find in others such faults as you <br>yourself possess, though you may not be aware of them, <br>and that you should find in others such misdeeds as you <br>yourself commit.\" After this, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) patted the chest of Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>with his loving hand and said, \"0,Abu Zar! there is no <br>wisdom better than prudence, nor any piety better than re- <br>fraining from the unlawful, nor any nobility better than <br>polite manners.\" <br>(In stating the contents of this long hadith, the gist and <br>meaning has been kept in view, in preference to the literal <br>translation.) <br>HADITH- 22 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Never do a people collect in one of the houses of <br>I <br>Allah (mosque) reciting the Qur'an and reading it out <br>to one another, but sakeenah (tranquillity) descends <br>upon them, rahmat (mercy) enshrouds them, the angels <br>throng around them and Almighty Allah mentions <br>them, in the assembly of angels.\" <br>!<br>This hadith describes the special virtues of religious <br>schools and institutions. Acquisition of either reward men- <br>tioned above is so sublime that even if one devotes his <br>whole life to acquire it, it will be worth while. But here <br>there are so many rewards, especially the last one. Mention <br>in the Court of Almighty Allah and remembrance in the <br>company of the beloved are bounties that can hardly be <br>surpassed. <br>Descending of sakeenah has been mentioned in many <br>ahadith. The scholars of ahadith have interpreted its real <br>significance in many ways. The various interpretations, <br>however, do not contradict each other and can be meaning- <br>fully put together. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) has interpreted sakee- <br>nah as a special breeze, which has a face like that of a <br>human being. <br>Allamah Suddi (Rahmatullah alaih) is reported to have <br>said that it is the name of a large golden dish in Paradise <br>used for washing the hearts of the Prophets (Alaihimus <br>salam) (peace be upo? them). <br>Some have said that it is a special form of mercy. <br>Tabari (Rahmatullah alaih) prefers the view that it <br>means peace of heart. Some interpret it as grace, others <br>consider it as dignity, and some take it to mean angels. <br>There are other views as well. Hafiz has written in 'Fat-hul <br>Baari' that sakeena includes all the above mentioned bles- <br>sings. In the opinion of Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih), it is a <br>combination of tranquility, mercy, etc., and descends along <br>with the angels. It is mentioned in the Qur'an as follows: <br>Then Allah caused His sakeenah to descend upon him. <br><br>It is He Who sent down sakeenah into the hearts of the <br>believers (XLVIII: 4). <br>Wherein is sakeenah from your Lord (I1 :248). <br>Thus this happy blessing is mentioned in several ayaat <br>of the Qur'an, and there are many ahadith containing tid- <br>ings of this. <br>It is narrated in 'Ihya' that once Ibn Thauban (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) had promised one of his relatives thqt he <br>would break his fast with him, but reached the house of his <br>relative next morning. When the host complained about the <br>guest being so late, the guest said, \"But fon the promise that <br>I owe you, I would never disclose what prevented me from <br>coming to you. I just got late by chance until it was time of <br>Ishaa salaat. I thought I should complete my Witr (compul- <br>sory salaat of three raka'at following Isha) as well, lest I <br>should die during the night without offering this salaat, be- <br>cause there can be no surety against death. While I was re- <br>citing qunoot (a special invocation in Witr salaat), I saw a <br>green garden of Paradise, which had all sorts of flowers. I <br>was so absorbed in the vision that it was dawn.\" There <br>have been hundreds of similar incidents in the lives of our <br>righteous ancestors. Such things are, however, experienced <br>only when there is complete separation from everyone be- <br>sides Allah, and perfect attention towards Him. <br>Similarly there are many ahadith mentioning en-<br>shrouding by the angels. A detailed story about Usaid ibn <br>Hudhair (Radhiyallaho anho) is given in the books of <br>Hadith. It is said that while he was reciting the Holy <br>Qur'an, he felt a sort of cloud spread over himself. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) informed him that <br>these were angels who had gathered to listen to the recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an. Due to their great throng they appeared <br>like a cloud. <br>Once a Sahabi felt a sort of cloud over himself. Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) told him that it was sa- <br>keenah, which was sent down by reason of the recitation of <br>the Qur'an. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>In Muslim Sharif, this hadith is given in greater detal~. <br>The concluding sentence is- <br>One whose evil deeds drive him away from the mercy <br>of Allah, the superiority of his lineage or nobility of his <br>family cannot bring him near it. <br>Thus a person who has a continuous noble pedigree, <br>but indulges in disobedience and impiety, cannot be equal <br>in the presence of Allah to a Muslim who is of low birth <br>and abject ir, humility, but otherwise God-fearing and <br>devout. <br>;\\ <br>$$;<br>&<br>&\\<br>$&, <br>Verily the noblest of you in the view of Allah is the <br>one who is most God-fearing. <br>i \t<br>HADITH- 23 <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"You <br>cannot turn to Allah and gain nearness to Him with <br>anything superior to that which directly proceeded <br>from Him, i.e., the Holy Qur'an.\" <br>It is evident from numerous ahadith that there is no <br>better means of seeking nearness to the presence of Allah <br>than recitation of the Qur'an. Imam Ahnlad ibn Hambal <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) says. \"I saw Almighty Allah in a <br>dream and asked Him what was the best means for seeking <br>nearness to His presence. Allah said, '0,Ahmad! It is My <br>Word (i.e. the Qur'an).' I enquired whether it is only <br>reading while understanding the meaning, or reading with- <br>out understanding. Allah said 'Whether by understanding <br>the meaning or without understanding. it is a means of <br>nearpess either way.\"' <br>I <br>-<br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 23)<br>That the reading of the Qur'an is the best means of get- <br>ting access to Almighty Allah is explained in the commen- <br>tary of Maulana Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi (Nawwarallaho <br>marqadahu), who is an authority for the prosterity. Its sub- <br>stance is that sulook ilallaah (the path of mystics towards <br>Allah) which is also.called the stage of Ihsaan can be at- <br>tained in three ways:- <br>, (1) 'Tasawwur', known as meditation in Sharee'at and <br>muraqabah in the terminology of mystics. <br>(2) Remembrance of \t Allah by repeating words of <br>praise for Him. <br>(3) \t Reading of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Since the first method is remembrance in the heart, so <br>there remain in fact two ways only; first the remembrance <br>by heart or by word of mouth, and secondly recitation of <br>the Qur'an. The essence of zikr is that the word which is <br>used for or refers to Almighty Allah should be repeated <br>over and over again. This repetition helps the mudrakah <br>(the faculty of understanding) in concentrating upon the <br>person of the one being remembered. It would give rise to a <br>feeling of immediate presence of that person. Constancy in <br>this state is called 'ma'iyyat' (togetherness), which is refer- <br>red to in the hadith below: <br>My servant ceases not to seek nearness to Me through<br>nafil (optional) deeds, until I make him My favourite, <br>and thus I become his ears wherewith he hears, his <br>eyes wherewith he sees, and his hands wherewith he <br>holds, and his feet wherewith he walks. <br>It means that when a person, through excessive devo- <br>tion becomes a favourite of Allah, Allah becomes a guard- <br>ian of all the limbs of his body so that his eyes, ears, etc., <br>all submit to His will. This blessing is said to be the result <br>of constancy in nafil salaat, because fard (obligatory) salaat <br>are specified and do not admit of excess, while nearness <br>and close attachment demand constancy and concentra- <br>tion, as mentioned above. <br>But this mode of seeking nearness is exclusive for that <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>P ~ r eand Beloved Being (Allah), and it is impossible to <br>seek nearness to anybody else by remembering his name <br>over and over again. This is because the one whose near- <br>ness is being sought must have two attributes. First, he <br>should be omniscient, so that he comprehends the zikr of <br>all the zaakireen, whether by word of mouth or by heart, ir- <br>respective of language, time and place. Secondly, he <br>should have the power to illumine the understanding and <br>fulfil the yearning of one who remembers, which is known <br>as 'dunuww' (nearness), 'tadalli' (proximity), 'nuzul' (de- <br>scent) and 'qurb' (nearness). Since these two prerequisites <br>are possessed only by Allah, the abovementioned method <br>of seeking nearness is effective only in respect of Him. The <br>following hadith-e-qudsi (a revelation of Allah quoted by <br>Rasulullah Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), points to this fact: <br>Whoever comes near Me by one span, I go near him by <br>an arm's length; whoever comes near Me by one arm's <br>length, I go near him by one 'baah' (stretch of both <br>arms); whoever comes to Me walking, I go towards him <br>running. <br>This similitude is only for illustration. Otherwise, <br>Allah is above walking and running. It only meails that <br>those who remember and seek Him are helped and looked <br>after by Almighty Allah in a measure far in excess of their <br>own inner urge and efforts. This is so, because it behoves <br>His Benevolence. So, the steadfastness of those who re-<br>member Him invokestconstant attention and results in the <br>descent of favours of Almighty Allah, the Glorious. The <br>Qur'an altogether is zikr of Allah, in the sense that no ayat <br>of the Qur'an is devoid of remembrance and attention to- <br>wards Allah, and as such it bears characteristics of zikr as <br>mentioned above. There is, however, another distinction of <br>the Qur'an, which is the cause of increased nearness to <br>Allah. And it is this: that every discourse carries the quali- <br>ties and influencing traits of the speaker. It is obvious that <br>recitation of the poetry of sinful and wicked people has its <br>evil effects, while the verses of righteous people excercise a <br>noble influence. It is for this reason that excessive study of <br>knowledge of logic and philosophy produces pride and <br>conceit, while excessive devotion to the study of hadith <br>leads to humility. Although as languages, both English and <br>Part I (Hadith 24) <br>Persian are equal, they produce varying influences upon <br>the readers due to the divergence in the beliefs and atti- <br>tudes of the various authors. It can be concluded that re- <br>peated recitation of the Qur'an will result in the reader's <br>* =<br>being influenced by the qualities of the Originator of the <br>(a<br>verses and in developing a natural affinity for them. More- <br>over, if a person is devoted to the publications of an author, ;d<br>he naturally starts liking and favouring that person. In the f .$<br>&me way, the reader of the Qur'an is sure to win Allah's * X <br>abundant grace, which in turn promotes nearness to Him. <br>May Allah bless us all with His favours. <br>HADITH- 24 <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"For Allah, <br>from amongst the people, there are some who are those <br>of <br>His household.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum) (may Allah be pleased with them) asked, <br>\"Who are those people?\" He replied \"Men of the <br>Qur'an. They are of the household of Allah, and are his <br>favoured ones.\" <br>\"Men of the Qur'an are those who always remain occu- <br>pied with the Qur'an and have got a special attachment to <br>it. That such people are of the household of Allah and His <br>favourites is evident. It is, therefore, clear from the fore- <br>going that, as long as such people always remain occupied <br>with the Qur'an, special favours of Almighty Allah con-<br>tinue to be conferred upon them. Certainly those who live <br>in constant company do become as one of the household. <br>What a great honour it is to belong to His household, to be <br>reckoned amongst the 'Men of Allah' and to become His <br>favourites, with such little striving and endeavour. What <br>sacrifices of comfort and money are not made by people for <br>admittance to worldly courts or to be elected as members of <br>an assembly. They flatter the voters and bear all sorts of hu- <br>miliations; yet they consider all this worthwhile. But the <br>endeavour for the Qur'an is considered as a waste of time <br>and energy: <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Look at the difference between the paths; what a great <br>divergence! <br>HADITH- 25 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Almighty Allah never gives attention so much to any- <br>thing as He does to the voice of a Prophet reading the <br>Qur'an in a sweet tone.\" <br>It has been mentioned earlier that Almighty Allah de- <br>votes special attention to the recitation of Qur'an, which is <br>His own Word. Since Prophets meticulously observe all the <br>rules of reverence in reading the Qur'an, Allah's listening <br>to them with greater attention is evident. And the sweet- <br>ness of voice itself adds to the embellishment. As for <br>people other than Prophets, their recitaticn attracts Divine <br>attention according to the standard of its excellence. <br>HADITH- 26 <br>Hadhrat Fudhaalah Ibn Ubaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallani) <br>said, \"Almighty Allah listens to the voice of the reader <br>of the Qur'an more eagerly than does a master to the <br>song of his singing slave girl.\" <br>! <br>It is natural that singing should attract attention. But <br>religious people do not listen to singing because of the re- <br>striction in Islam. However, Islam does not prohibit listen- <br>ing to the song of a slave woman in one's lawful <br>Part I (Hadith 26) <br>possession, even though, this may attract the fullest atten- <br>tion. <br>It is, however, necessary that the Qur'an shall not be <br>recited in a singing tone, because doing so is forbidden <br>according to several ahadith. In one hadith it is said: <br>Beware of reciting the Qur'an in a musical tone, like <br>that of lovers singing their love poems as musical com- <br>positions. <br>The mashaa'ikh say that one who reads the Glorious <br>Qur'an like a musical song is a faasiq (evil-doer), and even <br>a listener to such recitation commits a sin. It is, however, <br>desirable to recite the Qur'an in a sweet voice without fol- <br>lowing the rules of singing. There are various ahadith con- <br>taining exhortation for reading the Qur'an in a sweet voice. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said at one <br>place, \"Adorn the Qur'an with a good voice.\" In another <br>hadith it is said, \"A sweet voice makes the beauty of the <br>Qur'an twice as beautiful.\" <br>Hadhrat Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) has written in his book 'Ghunyah that once Hadhrat <br>Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to <br>pass a place in the vicinity of Kufa and saw a gathering of <br>evil-doers in a house. A singer named Zaazaan was singing <br>and playing his instrument. On hearing his voice, Ibn <br>Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"What a sweet voice, <br>only if it were used for reciting the Glorious Qur'an,\" and <br>thus saying he covered his head with a piece of cloth and <br>went his way. Zaazaan had seen him saying something. On <br>enquiring from the people, he came to know that Ibn <br>Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) was a Sahabi who had passed <br>saying those words. Zaazaan got very much perturbed by <br>that remark and, to cut the story short, he broke all his mu- <br>sical instruments arid became a follower of Ibn Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and thereafter rose to the position of a <br>distinguished scholar of his time. <br>There are various ahadith that commend reading of the <br>Holy Qur'an in a good voice and at the same time prohibit <br>reading it in a voice resembling singing, as has been stated <br>before. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Recite the <br>Qur'an in the Arabic accent, do not recite it in the tone of <br>lowers or in the voice of Jews and Christians. There will <br>shortly arise a people who will recite the Qur'an with affec- <br>tation like singers and mourners, and such reading will be <br>of no advantage to them at all. They themselves will get <br>into trouble, and so also those who admire their reading.\" <br>Taa'oos (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that someone asked <br>Rasulullah (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) \"Who it was who <br>read the, Glorious Qur'an in the best voice?\" Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is he whom you <br>hear and feel that he is under the fear of Allah, i.e., his <br>voice shows his being overwhelmed with fear.\" This is, <br>however, the extreme benevolence of Allah that He does <br>not expect from a person anything beyond his capacity. <br>There is a hadith that Allah has deputed an angel on a <br>special duty. If there be somebody who recites the Qur'an, <br>but is unable to do so as correctly, as it should be done, <br>this angel corrects his recitation before he takes it up to the <br>Heavens.\" <br>\"Oh, Allah! 1,cannot enumerate the praises due to Thee. <br>Hadhrat Ubaidah Mulaiki (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"0, <br>you devotees of the Qur'an! do not use the Qur'an as a <br>pillow, but read it properly day and night, as it ought <br>to be read. Propagate the Holy Qur'an, read it in a good <br>voice and ponder over its contents, so that you may, <br>succeed. Do not seek a reward for it (in this life], be- <br>cause it has got a magnificent reward (in the Here- <br>after).\" <br><br>Part I (Hadith 27) \t<br>A few points in this hadith are as follows: <br>(1) It is said that the Qur'an should not be used as a <br>pillow. Doing so is an act of disrespect towards the <br>Holy Book. It has been written by Ibn Hajar (Rah- 2 5 <br>matullah alaih) that using the Qur'an as a pillow, <br>C <br>a --2<br>stretching one's feet towards it, and trampling over <br>it, are acts which are all forbidden. Secondly, the <br>9 g <br>r q<br>expression \"using as a pillow\" also implies show- g x <br>ing neglect towards the Holy Qur'an. It serves no <br>purpose to place it on a pillow, as it is sometimes <br>found placed on a stand by the side of a grave in a <br>shrine for barakah (blessings). This is utter dis- <br>regard of the Holy Book. We owe it to the Holy <br>Book that it should be read. <br>(2) \t The expression \"Read it as it ought to be read\" <br>means that it should be read with the highest <br>degree of reverence. Commandment to this effect <br>is there in the Qur'an itself. <br>Those to whom We have given the Book, read it as it <br>ought to be read. <br>The orders of a king are received with great respect, <br>and a letter from the beloved is read with great fond- <br>ness; similarly the Qur'an sould be read with great re- <br>spect and fondness. <br>(3) \t The expression \"propagate the Qur'an\" means that <br>we should do so by speech, by writing, by persuas- <br>ion, by practising and by all other possible means. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ordered its <br>propagation and spreading, but some of our bright <br>thinkers consider it a vain task, and at the same <br>time they claim that they have great love for Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and for Islam. <br>According to a Persian verse: <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>I am afraid, 0, Bedouin! you can never reach Ka'bah. <br>Because the path you are following leads to Turkistan. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has ordered <br>spreading of the Qur'an, but we do not hesitate to put all <br>sorts of hurdles in the way of its propagation. We make <br>laws for compulsory secular education so that children, <br>instead of learning the Qur'an, are forced to join primary <br>schools. We are displeased with teachers in religious <br>schools for spoiling the lives of children, and, therefore, we <br>do not send our children to them. Even if this apprehen- <br>sion is correct, it does not absolve us of our responsibility. <br>On the other hand, our responsibility becomes even greater <br>because we are all duty-bound, individually and collecti- <br>vely, to propagate the Qur'an. The religious teacher is, no <br>doubt, responsible for his shortcomings, but if, because of <br>his defects, we prevent children from going to religious <br>schools, get notices issued to their parents in the name of <br>compulsory primary education, compelling them to de-<br>prive their children of learning the Qur'an, then this is like <br>killing a tuberculosis patient by giving him poison. An at- <br>tempt to justify our hostile conduct by the supposed omis- <br>sion on the part of the religious teacher is a lame excuse, <br>and this argument will not avail in the court of Almighty <br>Allah. We may consider it necessary to educate our chil- <br>dren in subjects like elementary arithmetic, to make them <br>fit for running a petty grocery shop or for getting employ- <br>ment with the country's rulers, but according to Almighty <br>Allah the learning of the Qur'an is the most important. <br>141 , \t'That recitation should be in a<br>. <br>sweet voice has <br>already been dxplained under the previous hadith. <br>(5) \t We are required to ponder over tile meaning of the <br>Qur'an. There is a quotation from the Torah in <br>'Ihya', in which Allah says, \"My servant! are you <br>not ashamed of your behaviour towards Me? If you <br>receive a letter from a friend while you are going <br>on a road you stop and sit at a suitable place and <br>read it with full attention and try to understand <br>every word therein. But in case of My Book, <br>wherein 1 have explained everything and have re- <br>peatedly emphasized important matters, so that <br>you may ponder over and understand them, you <br>show an attitude of indifference. Do you consider <br>Me inferior to your friend even? 0, My servant! <br>I <br>I <br>i <br>Part I (Hadith 28) <br>some of your friends sit with you and talk to you; <br>you pay them full attention. You listen to them <br>and try to understand them. If anybody tries to in- <br>terrupt you, you stop him with a gesture. I talk to <br>you through My Book, but you pay no heed. Do <br>you consider Me inferior to your friends?\" The <br>merits of meditation and contemplation on the <br>contents of the Qur'an have already been men-<br>tioned in the Foreword of this book and again <br>under hadith 8. <br>The expression \"do not seek prompt reward\" means <br>that no wages should be accepted for reciting the Qur'an, <br>because your recitation is going to fetch you a great reward <br>in the Hereafter. <br>To accept reward for it in this life is just like being <br>content with shells instead of money. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When my Ummat will attach <br>more value to money, it will lose the dignity which Islam <br>confers on it, and when it will give up enjoining good and <br>forbidding evil, it will be deprived of the blessings of <br>Divine Revelation, viz., the understanding of the Qur'an.\" <br>0,Allah! guard us against this. <br>Hadhrat Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I have <br>been given 'as-Sab'ut Tuwal' in lieu of the Torah, 'al- <br>Mi'een' in lieu of the Psalms, 'al-Mathaani' in lieu of <br>the Bible and al-Mufassal as a special favour to me.\" <br>The first seven surahs are called 'as-Sab'ut Tuwal' (the <br>seven longest ones); the next eleven are called 'al-Mi'een' <br>(surahs consisting of about a hundred ayaat each); the fol- <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>lowing twenty surahs are known as 'al-Mathaani' (the oft- <br>repeated ones), while all the remaining surahs are called <br>'al-Mufassal' (the explicit ones). This division is according <br>to a popular interpretation, but there is some difference of <br>opinion as to whether a certain surah is included in 'as- <br>Sab'ut Tuwal' or 'al-Mi'een'. Similarly there is a dis-<br>agreement as to whether a surah falls under 'al-Mathaani' <br>or 'al-Mufassal'. But this disagreement does not affect the <br>meaning or purpose of this hadith. This hadith shows that <br>the Holy Qur'aan contains the equivalents of all the import- <br>ant Heavenly Books that had been revealed earlier, and <br>moreover contains 'al-Mufassal' as a special addition, the <br>like of which is not to be found in the earlier books. <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates: <br>\"Once I was sitting with a group of indigent muhaji- <br>reen, who did not even have sufficient clothes to cover <br>their whole body and as such some of them were <br>hiding themselves behind others. A qaari (one who is <br>well versed in reciting the Qur'an) was reciting the <br>Glorious Qur'an. Suddenly Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) came and stood near us. On his arri- <br>val the reader stopped reciting. He invoked peace upon <br>us, and asked us what we had been doing. We replied <br>that we had been listening to the Holy Qur'an. Then <br>Part I (Hadith 29) <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"All <br>praise is for Allah, Who created such people in my <br>Ummat that I have been ordered to stay with them.' Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sat in our midst <br>so as to be equidistant from all of us. Then he asked all 4'\" <br>of us to get closer to him. All of us sat with our faces <br>towards him. Thereafter, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>d <br>wasallam) said, '0, you poor muhajireen, I give you <br>-5 +<br>glad tidings of perfect noor on the Day of Judgement, * X <br>and you shall enter Paradise before wealthy people by <br>half a day, and this half day will be equal to five hun- <br>dred years. \" <br>That muhajireen did not even have sufficient clothes <br>to cover their whole body apparently refers to the exposure <br>of that part of the body which it is not obligatory to cover. <br>But in public one feels shy at the exposure of even such <br>parts. This is the reason why they were sitting behind one <br>another. <br>They did not become aware of the arrival of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as he came, because of their <br>pre-occupation. They saw him when he had come very <br>near to them and then, out of respect, the reader stopped <br>reading. <br>Although Rasulullarh (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>seen one of them reading the Qur'an, he inquired about <br>what they had been doing. This enquiry was to express his <br>pleasure over what he had seen them doing. <br>One day in the next life will be equal to one thousand <br>years of this world, as is given in the Holy Qur'an: <br>\"Lo! a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of <br>that ye reckon.\" <br>This is the reason why the Arabic word <br>(ghadan) <br>(tomorrow) is generally used while referring to the Day of <br>Judgement. Even this will be the probable length of a day <br>for the believers in general. As for the disbelievers, the <br>Qur'an says that: <br>\"A day will be equal to fifty thousand years.\" <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>For true believers, this day will be shorter according to <br>their status. It is reported that, for some true believers, it <br>will be like the time spent in two rakaat of Fajr salaat. <br>The merits of reading the Qur'an are given in many <br>ahadith. Similarly, the merits of listening to the Qur'an are <br>also found in numerous ahadith. The act of listening to the <br>recitation of the Qur'an is so virtuous that Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had been ordered to stay among <br>those engaged in reading the Qur'an, as given in this <br>hadith. Some learned scholars are of the opinion that lis- <br>tening to the Qur'an is more virtuous than reading it, be- <br>cause reading the Qur'an is nafl and listening fard, and fard <br>act is always better than a nafl one. <br>From this hadith there is one more deduction, in re- <br>spect of which the learned scholars differ in their opinion. <br>There is disagreement as to whether a destitute but stead- <br>fast person, who conceals his poverty from others is better, <br>or a wealthy person who is grateful to Allah and discharges <br>his obligations. This hadith provides an argument in favour <br>of the destitute one who is steadfast. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiycilaho anho) reports <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Whoever listens to one ayat of the Holy Qur'an, there <br>is written for him a twofold virtue, and whoever re- <br>cites it (one ayat), it shall be noor for him on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have questioned the above <br>hadith with respect to its authority, but its subject-matter is <br>also affirmed by various other traditions to the effect that <br>even listening to the recitation of the Holy Qur'an carries <br>great reward, so much so that according to some scholars, <br>listening to the.recitation of the Glorious Qur'an is more <br><br>Part I (Hadith 31) <br>virtuous than its reading. Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>while sitting on the mimbar (pulpit), said to him, \"Recite <br>the Qur'an for me.\" Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, <br>\"It does not behove me to read out the Qur'an to you, be- <br>cause it is you to whom it was revealed.\" Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"It is mv heart's desire to <br>listen.\" Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) adds that when <br>he recited the Qur'an, tears started flowing from the eyes of <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Once Saalim (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), the freed slave of Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) was reciting the Glorious Qur'an and Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stood by, listening to him for a <br>long time. Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>listened to recitation of the Glorious Qur'an by Abu Musa <br>Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) and admired his reading. <br>HADITH- 31 <br>Hadhrat 'IJqbah ibn Aarnii (Radhiyallaho anho) reports <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"One <br>reading the Qur'an loudly is like one who gives alms <br>openly, and one who reads silently is like one who <br>gives alms secretly.\" <br>Sometimes it is more rewarding to give alms openly, <br>when there is some good reason and. the intention is to <br>induce others by example. At other times, giving alms <br>secretly is more virtuous, for instance, when 'the intention <br>is to avoid show on one's own part or to save the recipient <br>from humiliation. <br>In the same way, recitation of the Qur'an in a loud <br>voice carries more reward when the intention is to induce <br>others; besides, in this there is reward also for those who <br>listen. At times it would be preferable to rear1 silently, so as <br>to avoid inconvenience to others or show on one's part. <br>Thus the reading, either way, has independent virtue. <br>Sometimes one mode is preferable, and sometimes the <br>other. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Many people have argued on the basis of this hadith <br>that reading in a low voice is more virtuous. Imam Baihaqi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) in his book, 'Kitabush Shu'ab', has <br>written that Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) had re- <br>ported that the reward of doing a good act secretly is se- <br>venty times more than that of doing it openly. But, <br>according to the rules laid down by the muhadditheen <br>I <br>(scholars of ahadith), this hadith is dha'eef (weak). <br>I <br>Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Do not read in a <br>loud voice, lest the voice of one should get mixed up with <br>the other.\" Hadhrat Umar ibn Abdul Aziz (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) found a person reading the Qur'an in a loud voice in <br>Musjid-i-Nabawi and had stopped him. The reader, how- <br>ever, tried to argue, whereupon Hadhrat 'Umar ibn Abdul <br>Aziz (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If you read for the sake of <br>Allah, read in a low voice and, if you read for the sake of <br>men, then such reading is of no use.\" <br>Similarly an advice of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), for reading the Qur'an in a loud voice, has also <br>been reported. <br>'Sharhul Ihya' contains both 'riwaayaat' (Plural of 'ri- <br>wayat-Narrative tradition) and 'aathaar' (sayings of Saha- <br>bah) urging the reading of the Glorious Qur'an in a loud as <br>well as in a low voice. <br>HADITH- 32 <br>d S  <br># -<br>I.,<br>j?Sj & 2~ a,?\\ <br>s\\<br>, <br>* & h\\ &,<br>J &k2 (Yl')<br>t& <br>Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The Qur'an <br>is such an interceder whose intercession is accepted, <br>and a disputant whose dispute is upheld. Whoever <br>keeps it in front of him, it draws him to Paradise, and <br>whoever puts it behind his back, it hurls him, into <br>Hell.\" <br>This means that, if the Qur'an intercedes on behalf of <br>anybody, its intercession is accepted by Almighty Allah. <br>Part It(Hadith 33)'<br>69 <br>The meaning of the \"pleading of the Glorious Qur'an\" has <br>already been explained under hadith 8. The Qur'an pleads <br>in the Court of Allah for increasing the sfatus of those who <br>abide by it, and-takes to task those who neglect it. If one <br>keeps it in front of him, i.e., follows it and acts upon its <br>commands throughout his life, it leads him to Paradise. <br>And if one turns his back towards it, i.e., does not follow it, <br>he will, no doubt, fall into the pit of Hell. According to the <br>author, indifference to the Qur'an can also amount to put- <br>ting it behind the back. In many ahadith there are several <br>warnin s for those who neglect the Word of Allah. In the <br>book o f Sahihul Bukhari' there is a long hadith, according <br>to which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was once <br>made by Almighty Allah to view some of the punishments <br>given to the sinful ones. He was shown a person on whose <br>head a stone was being struck with such force that the head <br>was crushed. On the enquiry of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) it was said that Allah had taught His Gin-<br>rious Word to that person, but he neither recited it during <br>the night nor acted upon it during the day. so now this <br>treatment for him will continue till the Day ot Judgement. <br>May Allah through His grace save us from His chastise- <br>ment. In fact, the Holy Qur'an is such a great blessing that <br>any indifference to it certainly deserves the severest pun- <br>ishment. <br>HADITH- 33 <br>Hadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"The sowm (fast) and the Qur'an both intercede for the <br>obedient person. The fast submits, '0 Allah! I pre-<br>vented him from eating and drinking during the day, <br>so You accept my intercession on his behalf, and the <br>Holy Qur'an says, '0, Allah! I denied him sleep at <br>night, so You accept my intercession for him.' Conse- <br>quently, the intercession of both of them is accepted.\" <br>In the book 'Targhib', the hadith mentions the words <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>'ta'aam' and 'sharaab' i.e. food and drink, as translated <br>above, but in the book of Haakim we find the word 'shaha- <br>waat' (passions) in place of 'sharaab', i.e. fasting prevented <br>a person from eating and indulging in his passions. It is im- <br>plied here that one should abstain even from such acts of <br>physical pleasure which are permissible e.g. kissing and <br>embracing (one's own wife). It is given in some ahadith <br>that the Holy Qur'an will appear in the semblance of a <br>youth and will say, \"It is I who kept you awake during the <br>night and thirsty during the day.\" <br>This hadith implies that a hafiz should recite the <br>Qur'an in nafl salaat at night, as explained already in detail <br>under hadith 27. In the Holy Qur'an itself at various places <br>there are encouragements to this effect. Some verses are <br>given below: <br>(1) And keep awake some part of the night for reciting <br>it in Tahajjud salaat. <br>(2) \t And worship Him in a portion of the night and <br>glorify Him during the long night. <br>I<br>(3) \t They recite verses revealed by Allah during the <br>night and thqy fall in sajdah (prostration) before <br>Him. <br>(4) \t And who spend the night before their Lord, pros- <br>trate and standing. <br>Consequently, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and his Sahabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) sometimes spent <br>the whole night in reciting the Holy Qur'an. It is reported <br>ahout Hadhrat 'Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) that some-<br>times he recited the whole of Qur'an in a single rak'at of <br>his Witr salaat. In the same way, 'Abdullah ibn Zubair <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) used to recite the whole Qur'an in a <br>single night. Ga'eed ibn Jubair (Rahmatullah alaih) read out <br><br>Part I (Hadith 33) <br>the whole Qur'an in two rakaats inside the Ka'bah. Thabit <br>Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) used to read out the whole <br>Qur'an in one day and night, and so was also the case with <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho). Abu Shaikh Hannaa'i <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"I read the whole Qur'an twice, <br>and ten parts in addition, in a single night. If I wanted, I y<br>could have completed the third reading as well.\" In the eg<br>course of his journey for the Haj pilgrimage, Salih ibn <br>KaGaan (Radhiyallaho anho) often used to complete two 5x <br>readings of the Qur'an each night. Mansoor ibn Zaazaan <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) completed one reading during nafl <br>salaat before noon, and the second reading in the interval <br>between Zuhr (afternoon) and Asr (late afternoon) salaat, <br>and he spent the whole night in offering nafl salat, weeping <br>so much that the end of his turban would become wet. <br>Similar had been the case with many others, as described <br>by Muhammad ibn Nasr (Rahmatullah alaih) in his book <br>'Qiyaamul Lail' <br>It is written in 'Sharhul Ihya' that our ancestors in <br>deen differed from one another in their practices of com- <br>pleting the reading of the whole Qur'an. Some of them <br>completed one reading of the whole Qur'an every day, as <br>was the practice of Imam Shaafi'ee (Rahmatullah alaih) in <br>months other than Ramadhap; and some completed two <br>readings everyday, as was also done by Imam Shaafi'ee <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) during the month of Ramadhan. Such <br>was also the practice ofAswad, Salih bin Kaisaan, Sa'eed <br>bin Jubair and of . <br>~ others. Some used to complete <br>y <br>three readings every day. This was the practice of Sulaim <br>ibn Atar, who was an eminent Taabi'ee (the follower-of a <br>Sahabi). He had taken part in the conquest of Egypt during <br>the regime of Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) and was <br>also appointed wler of Qasas by Hadhrat Ameer Mu'aa- <br>wiyah (Ra&ryallaho <br>anho). He used to complete three <br>readingd the whole Qur'an every night. <br>Imam Nawawi writes in 'Kitabul Azkar' that the maxi- <br>mum daily recitation reported is of Ibnul Kaatib who used <br>to complete eight readings of the Holy Qur'an during each <br>day and night. Ibn Quddamah has reported that, according <br>to Imam Ahmad (Rahmatullah alaih), there is no limitation <br>in this respect and that it entirely depends on the zest of <br>the reader. Historians have stated that Imam Abu Hanifah <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) used to complete sixty-one readings in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the month of Ramadhan-once everyday, once everynight, <br>and one reading was completed in Taraweeh salaat. <br>On the other hand, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said that one who completes one reading of the <br>Qur'an in less than three days cannot meditate upon it. For <br>this reason, Ibn Hazm (Rahmatullah alaih) and some others <br>are of the opinion that reading the whole Qur'an in less <br>than three days is forbidden. According to the authar, this <br>hadith refers to the capacity of the readers in general, <br>otherwise completion of one reading of the Holy Qur'an <br>in less than three days by a group of Sahabah has been <br>reported. Similarly, according to the opinion of the Jamhur <br>(general body of 'ulama), there is no limitation on the maxi- <br>mum period in which one reading should be completed. <br>The reading should be completed within such time as is <br>convenient. But some 'ulama say that the maximum period <br>should not exceed forty days. This means that at least <br>three-fourth of a part should be read daily and if, for any <br>reason, this much of reading-is not done on any day, the <br>missed portion should also be covered on the next day, so <br>that the whole reading is completed within forty days. <br>According to the consensus of opinion, this is not obliga- <br>tory but, in view of the belief of some 'ulama, it is better <br>that the daily reading should not be less than this. This <br>view is supported by some ahadith. The author of Majma' <br>has reported in one hadith: <br>Whoever completqd the reading of the whole Qur'an in <br>forty nights, delayed the matter. <br>Some 'ulama are of the opinion that the whole reading <br>should be completed once every month, though it is prefer- <br>able to complete one reading every week, as was the prac- <br>tice of the most of the Sahabah. One should start on Friday <br>and read one manziE (halting stage) daily, thus to complete <br>on Thursday. It has+already been stated that, according to <br>Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah alaih), we owe it to the <br>Qur'an that it must be read at least twice a year. Therefore, <br>under no circumstances should one do less than this. <br>There is a hadith according to which, if the reading of <br>the whole Qur'an is completed in the beginning of the day, <br>the angels invoke mercy for the reader throughout the rest <br>of the day and for rest of a night if done in the beginning of <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I. \t<br><br>Part I (Hadith 34) \t<br>the night. Some mashaa'ikh have, therefore, concluded that <br>the reading of the whole Qur'an should be completed pref- <br>erably in the early part of the day during the summer <br>season and in the early part of the night during winter, so <br>that the reader is benefited for a longer period by the pray- 4 3<br>ers of the angels. <br>\"i <br>a& <br>HADITH- 34 <br>*,k<br>' e r .  \t \" \" <br>. r  <br>9.. <br>* <br>&L& Al JrJ JU J U S ,  u <br>.-. <br>(Yf)<br>Al &j & 2 1Srj <br>#. \t<br>I .  <br>r<br>62y; uy;$9 qiy\\ G\\~2 <br>a2 &i+ <br>(p.l&YI <br>j j IS.+-+ <br>j!,JEJI<br>J' Ul-+ obJ <br>JG) <br>Hadhrat Sa'eed bin Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>reported that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"On the Day of Judgement, before Allah, no other <br>intercessor will have a greater status than the Qur'an, <br>neither a Prophet nor an angel, etc.\" <br>It has been learnt from several other ahadith that the <br>Holy Qur'an is an intercessor-such an intercessor whose <br>intercession will be accepted. May Almighty Allah make <br>the Qur'an intercede for us all, and may He not make it an <br>opponent or a complainant against us. <br>In 'La'aali Masnoo'ah' it is reported from the riwaayat <br>of Bazzaar, which is not considered as concocted, \"When a <br>man dies and his relatives are busy in funeral rites, there <br>stands an extremely handsome man by his head. When the <br>dead body is shrouded, that man gets in between the <br>shroud and the chest of the deceased. When, after the <br>burial, the people return home, two angels, Munkar and <br>Nakeer (names of two special Angels), come in the grave <br>and try to separate this handsome man so that they may be <br>able to interrogate the dead man in privacy about his faith. <br>But the handsome man says, \"He is my companion, he is <br>my friend. I will not leave him alone in any case. If you are <br>appointed for interrogation, do your job. I cannot leave him <br>until I get him admitted into Paradise.\" Thereafter he turns <br>to his dead companion and says, \"I am the Qur'an, which <br>you used to read, sometimes in a loud voice and sometimes <br>in a low voice. Do not worry. After the interrogation of <br>Munkar and Nakeer, you will have no grief.\" When the <br>interrogation is over, the handsome man arranges for him <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>from al-Mala'ul A'laa (the angels in Heaven) a silk bedding <br>filled with musk. May Allah bestow this favour on all of us. <br>This hadith in its complete form contains a description <br>of many virtues and has not been quoted in full for the sake <br>of brevity. <br>HADITH- 35 <br>Hadhrat 'Abdullah bin 'Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reports that Rasulullah (Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"Whoever reads the Qur'an secures the knowl- <br>edge of prophethood within his r$s (bosom), though <br>Divine Revelation is not seht upon him. It does not <br>befit one endowed with the Qur'an that he should be <br>indignant ,with those in anger, nor should he indulge <br>in any acf of ignorance with those who are ignorant, <br>while thepur'an is there in his bosom.\" <br>Since thd chaih of wahi (revelation) ended with Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallyllaho alaihe wasallam), further wahi cannot <br>come. But $ince the Qur'an is the Word of the Almighty <br>Allah, it dofUbtlessly contains the knowledge of 'Nubuwwat <br>(propheth d) and if anybody is blessed with this knowl- <br>edge, it is 9\"<br>incumbent upon him that he should display the <br>best condbct, and should refrain from bad manners. Fud- <br>hail bin paadh (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that a hafiz <br>of the Qyr'an is a bearer of the banner of Islam, and as such <br>it does qot behove him to join those who indulge in frivol- <br>ous puqsuits, or associate with the neglectful, or mix with <br>t-<br>the indolent. <br>HADITH- 36 <br>I <br><br>Part I (Hadith 37) <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Three <br>persons are such as will have no fear of the horrors of <br>the Day of Judgement, nor will they be required to <br>render any account. They will stroll merrily on <br>mounds of musk until the people are relieved of ren- <br>dering their account. One is a person who learnt the <br>Qur'an, merely seeking Allah's pleasure and therewith <br>leads people in salaat in a manner that they are <br>pleased with him; the second person is one who <br>invites men to salaat for the pleasure of Allah alone. <br>The third person is. one who has fair dealings between <br>him and his master, as well as between himself and his <br>subordinates.\" <br>The severity, the horror, the dread and the miseries of <br>the Day of Judgement are so great that a true Muslim is <br>neither unmindful nor unaware of them. To be relieved of <br>those worries in any way, on the Day of Judgement, is a <br>favour that surpasses thousands of blessings and millions <br>of pleasures. Those who will then be made to relax and <br>rejoice will be the fortunate ones indeed. Utter ruin and <br>loss is the lot of those insensible persons who consider the <br>reading of the Qur'an as useless and waste of time. <br>In 'Mu'jam Kabeer', it is written about this hadith that <br>its reporter, Hadhrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar (Radhiyal!aho <br>anho), who was a Sahabi of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"If I had not heard this hadith from Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once, once again and <br>once again (he repeated it seven times), I would never have <br>reported it.\" <br>HADITH- 37 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that <br>Rasulslllah~~SallaNaho <br>Abu <br>alaihe wasallam) said, \"0, <br>Zar if you go in the morning and learn one ayai from <br>the Book of Allah, it will be better for you than your <br>offering one hundred rakaat of nafl salaat, and if you <br>I<br>learn one chapter of knowledge, which may m may not <br>be practised at that time will be better for you than <br>your offering one thousand rakaat of nafl salaat. <br>It is mentioned in many ahadith that ac uiring kpowl- <br>I<br>edge of religion is more virtuous than woraip. There are <br>so many traditions on the virtues of learning that they <br>cannot a11 be mentioned here. Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"The superiority of an aalim over an aabid <br>(worshipper) is like my superiority over the lowest among <br>you.\" He is also reported to have said that a single faqeeh <br>(jurist) is harder against Satan than one thousand worship- <br>pers. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports <br>that RaduIullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Whoever recites ten ayaat in a night, is not wckoned <br>amongst'the'neglectful.\" <br>It takes only a few minutes to recite ten ayaat. Doing so <br>saves a man from beiqg included in the list of the neglect- <br>ful, for that night. It is really a great reward. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Whoever remains steadfast in the five salaat will not <br>be written amongst the neglectful; and whoever reads <br><br>Part I (Hadith 40) <br>one hundred ayaat in a night will be written among the <br>qaaniteen (the obedient).\" <br>Hadhrat Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) reports that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever 2 9 <br>reads one hundred ayaat in a night will be exempted from <br>the demands of the Qur'an, and one who reads two hun- <br>go,<br>dred ayaat will get a reward for offering salaat throughout <br>$<br>the night and one who recites five hundred to one thous- + x  <br>and ayaat will get one qintaar. The Sahabah asked, \"What <br>is meant by a qintaar?\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) replied, \"It is equal to twelve thousand daraahim or <br>danaaneer (Plural of dirham and deenaar, respectively- <br>unit of currency used in Hijaaz in the Holy Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) days).\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has reported, <br>\"Hadhrat Jibra'eel (Alayhis salaam) once informed <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that many fit- <br>nahs will certainly appear. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) asked, 'What will be the way out, 0, <br>Jibra'eel?' He replied, 'The Book of Allah.\" <br>To act upon the Book of Allah serves as a safeguard <br>against fitnahs, and its blessed recitation is a means of <br>relief from the evils. It has already been mentioned in <br>hadith 22 that if the Qur'an is recited in a house, peace and <br>mercy descend upon it and Satan quits the place. The <br>'ulama interpret fitnahs to mean the coming of Dajjaal <br>(Islamic Anti-Christ), the invasion by the Tatars, and like <br>incidents. A long riwaayat from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) also includes the subject-matter of this hadith. <br>It is mentioned in this riwaayat of Hadhrat 'Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that Hadhrat Yahya (Alayhis salaam) told <br>the Israelites: \"Allah orders you to read His Book, and if <br>you do so, you will be like the people protected in a fort, so <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>that on whichever side the enemy wants to attack you, he <br>will find there the Word of Allah as a guard to repulse <br>him.\" <br>f <br><br>- - <br>Part 2 Concluding Section <br>PART 2 <br>CONCLUDING SECTION <br>There are a few ahadith over and above the forty <br>already narrated, which certainly need to be men-<br>tioned, being appropriate for this place. <br>In this section, some special virtues of certain surahs <br>are narrated. These surahs are short, but excel in virtues <br>and rewards. In addition, there are one or two important <br>matters, about which the readers of the Qur'an need to be <br>warned. <br>HADITH-1 <br>Hadhrat 'Abdul Malik bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"In surah Fatihah there is a cure for all ailments.\" <br>The virtues of surah Fatihah are found in many aha- <br>dith. It is reported in one hadith, \"a Sahabi was offering <br>nafl salaat; Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) called <br>him, but since he was offering salaat he did not respond. <br>After completing +e salaat he went to Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>!ah0 alaihe wasallgm), who asked him why he did not re- <br>spond as soon as he\\ was called. He submitted that he could <br>not do so because he was offering salaat. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaih ei.<br>wasallam) asked if he dit not read the following <br>verse in Qu 'an: <br>Respond to the call of Allah and His Messenger when- <br>ever They call you. <br>Then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I tell <br>you of a surah which is the greatest, the most virtuous in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the Holy Qur'an. It is surah Al-Hamd (The first surah of the <br>Qur'an), which has seven ayaat. These are the 'Sab'ul <br>I <br>Mathaani' and represent the Grand Qur'an.\" It is said by <br>some Sufia that whatever there was in the earlier Divine <br>I <br>Books is condensed in the Glorious Qur'an, and the con- <br>tents of Qur'an are condensed into 'surah Fatihah; and that <br>which is in surah Fatihah is found in Bismillaah and that <br>which is in Bismillah is to be found in its first letter .,(ba). <br>It is explained that sf (ba) is a co-ordinating conjunction <br>and stands for uniting. Surely the ultimate aim is to effect <br>I <br>union of a devotee with Almighty Allah. Some 'Sufia' have <br>I <br>gone still further and have said that whatever there is in 4, <br>i <br>(ba) is to be found in its dot, which signifies the Unity of <br>Allah-a thing which is indivisible as a dot. <br>Some scholars are reported to have said that the verse- <br>\"We worship Thee and we seek Thy help\", is prayer <br>for fulfilment of all our objectives, both worldly and spiri- <br>tual. According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said, \"By Him Who is <br>in possession of my life, a surah like this one has neither <br>been revealed in the Torah nor in the Bible nor in the <br>Psalms, nor even in the rest of the Qur'an. <br>I<br>The Mashaa'ikh have stated that the reading of surah <br>Fatihah with firm belief and faith cures all maladies, <br>whether spiritual or worldly, external or internal. To use <br>its writing as an amulet, and also licking its writing is <br>useful in the treatment of diseases. It occurs in Sihaah (the <br>six authentic books oftHadith) that the Sahabah used to <br>read surah Fatihah and blow upon those bitten by a snake <br>or a scorpion, and even on the epileptic and on the men- <br>tally deranged. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>~ <br>also approved of this. There is another riwaayat to the <br>effect that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited <br>this surah and blew on Saa'ib bin Yazeed and applied his <br>saliva on the spot (where some pain was felt by the latter). <br>According to another hadith, it is said that if, at the time of <br>going to sleep, one reads surah Fatihah ,and surah Ikhlaas <br>and blovs on himself he will be immune from all dangers <br>except death. <br>According to one riwaayat, surah Fatihah is equivalent <br>to two-thirds of the Qur'an in reward. It is also reported <br><br>Part 11 (Hadith 1) <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"I <br>have been given four things from the special treasure of the <br>Arsh, from which nothing has ever been given to any one <br>before. These are surah Fatihah, Aayatul Kursi, the con- <br>cluding ayaat of surah Baqarah and Surah Kowthar.\" Hadh- <br>rat Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) reports the saying of <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that whoever reads <br>surah Fatihah is like one who reads the Torah, the Gospel, <br>the Psalms and the Glorious Qur'an. <br>It is reported in one hadith that the devil lamented, <br>wept and threw dust on his head on four occasions; first, <br>when he was cursed; secondly when he was cast out of <br>Heaven unto the earth; thirdly when Hadhrat Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was given the Prophethood, <br>and fourthly when surah Fatihah was revealed. <br>It is reported from Sha'bi (Rahmatullah alaih) that once <br>a man came to him and complained of pain in his kidney. <br>Sha'bi (Rahmathulla alaih) advised him to read Asaasul <br>Qur'an (the foundation of the Qur'an) and blow on the <br>aching spot. When he inquired what was meant by \"Asaa- <br>sul Qur'an\", Sha'bi replied, \"Surah Fatlhah.\" <br>It is written in the established practices of mashaa'ikh <br>that surah Fatihah is the Isme A'zam (r.kc'lr.l),the Most <br>Glorious Name of Allah, and it should be read for the <br>achievement oE all our objectives. There are two ways of <br>reading it: <br>One method is to read this surah forty-one times for <br>forty days, in the interval between the sunnat (a practice of <br>the Holy Prophet) (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and fardh <br>rak'aats of the Fajr salaat. The meem of ?>I 2>1ItJ (Bis-<br>millaahir rahmaanir raheem) should be read jointlv with <br>the laam of - .  <br>(Alhamdu lillaahil. Whatever the ob- <br>A U I  <br>jective may be, it will, insha-Allah (if Allah wills), be ful- <br>filled. In the treatment of a patient or of one who is <br>bewitched, it should be recited and blown on water to be <br>used for drinking. <br>The second method is to read it seventy times between <br>the sunnat and the fardh rak'aat of the Fajr salaat on the <br>first Sunday of a new moon, after which the number is <br>reduced by ten every day until the course ends with a <br>reading of ten times on the seventh day. Then this weekly <br>course should be repeated, so as to complete four weeks. If <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the purpose is achieved at&e end of the first month, well <br>and good, otherwise this-course should be repeated for the <br>second and, if necessary, for the third mwth. <br>The surah is also written with water of roses, musk <br>and saffron, on a porcelain dish, then the writing is washed <br>off and the wash-water is given to the patient for d~iAkifTg <br>for forty days. This is a sure treatment of chronic diseases. <br>To read it seven times and then blow on the patient is simi- <br>larly an accepted treatment for toothache, headache and <br>pain in the stomach. <br>All these points have been briefly quoted from the <br>book 'Mazaahir-e-Haq.\" <br>'Muslim Sharif' contains a hadith in which Ibn 'Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that once Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was sitting among us and said, \"In <br>Heaven a door has been opened today which was never <br>opened before, and out of it has descended an angel who <br>had never descended before. The angel said to me, \"Re- <br>ceive the good news of two 'antvaar' which have not been <br>bestowed upon anyone else before. One is surah Fatihah <br>and the other the concluding portion of surah Baqarah, i.e. <br>its last 'ruku' (section of the. Qur'an)'.\" These two surahs <br>have been called 'noor', because on the Day of Judgement <br>these will travel in front of their readers (illuminating their <br>path). <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat 'Ataa' bin Abi Ribaah, (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have said, \"Whoever reads surah Yaaseen in <br>the beginning of the day, all his needs for that day are <br>fulfilled.\" <br>Many merits of surah Yaaseen are mentioned in aha- <br>dith. It is said in one hadith, \"Everything has a heart, and <br>the heart of the Glorious Qur'an is surah Yaaseen. Whoever <br>re.eds surah Yaaseen, Almighty Allah records for him a <br>reward equal to that of reading the whole Qur'an ten <br>times.\" <br>Part II (Hadith 2 )<br>According to another Hadith Almighty Allah recited <br>surah Yaaseen and surah Taahaa one thousand years before <br>the creation of Heaven and Earth, and on hearing this the <br>angels said, \"Blessing is for the ummat unto whom the ,,<br>Qur'an will be sent down, blessing is for the hearts that 5 <br>-Z<br>will bear, i.e. memorize it, and blessing is for the tongues <br>that will recite it.\" <br>t3 <br>There is other riwaayat like this, \"Whoever reads surah 3 <br>Yaaseen for the pleasure of Allah only, all his earlier sins <br>are forgiven. Therefore make a practice of reading this <br>surah over your dead.\" <br>According to one hadith, surah Yaaseen is named in, <br>Torah as mun'imah (giver of good things), because it con- <br>tains benefits for its reader in this life as well as in the <br>Hereafter; it removes from him the afflictions of this world <br>and the next; and takes away the dread of the next life. <br>This 'surah' is also known as 'Raafi'ah Khaafidhaah', <br>i.e., that which exalts the status of the believers and de- <br>grades the unbelievers. According to a riwaayat, Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"My heart desires that <br>surah Yaaseen should be present in the heart of everyone of <br>my ummat.\" According to another hadith, if anybody re- <br>cites surah Yaaseen every night and then dies, he dies as <br>shaheed (martyr). <br>It is reported in another hadith \"Whoever reads surah <br>Yaaseen, is forgiven; whoever reads it in hunger, is satis- <br>fied; whoever reads it having lost his wa finds the way; <br>whoever reads it on losing an animal fin d's the same. And <br>when one reads it apprehending that his food will run <br>short, that food becomes sufficient. And if one reads it <br>beside a person who is in the throes of death, the same are <br>made easy for him. And if anyone reads it on a woman ex- <br>periencing difficulty in child-birth, her delivery becomes <br>easy.\" <br>Maqri (Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"If surah Yaaseen is <br>read by one who fears the ruler or an enemy, he gets rid of <br>this fear.\" According to another hadith, if somebody reads <br>surah Yaaseen and surah Was-Saaffaat on Friday and begs <br>of Allah something, his prayer is granted. (Most of the <br>above has been drawn from Mazaahir-e-Haq, though the <br>scholars of hadith have questioned some of the riwaayaat). <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>surah Al-Waaqi'ah every night, starvation shall never <br>afflict him.\" <br>Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho qnho) used to command his <br>daughters to recite this surah every night. <br>The virtues of surah Al-Waaqi'ah are also reported in <br>many ahadith. There is a riwaayat to the effect that who- <br>ever reads surahs al-Hadeed, Al-Waaqi'ah and Ar-Rah-<br>maan, is reckoned amongst the dwellers of Jannat-ul-<br>Firdaus (the highest level of Paradise). In another hadith, it <br>is stated that surah Al-Waaqi'ah, is surah Al-Ghinaa. Read <br>it and teach it to your children. Another riwaayat says: <br>\"Teach it to your wives.\" Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) is reported to have emphasized its reading. But it is <br>low mentality on our part to read it only for sake of petty <br>worldly gain. If instead, it is read for the contentment of <br>the heart and for the sake of the next world, then worldly <br>gains will come to us without the asking. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"There is in the Qur'an a surah of thirty ayaat which <br>intercedes for a person (its reader) until he is forgiven. <br>This is surah Tabarakal lazi. \" <br>About surah Tabarakal lazi, there is a riwaayat also <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"My <br><br>Part 11 (Hadith 4) <br>heart desires that this surah should be in the heart of every <br>believer.\" <br>According to a hadith, one who reads surah Tabarakal <br>lazi and Alif-Laam Meem-Sajdah, between the Maghrib 3 3<br>(dusk) salaat and the Ishaa' salaat, is like a person who 8-,<br>stands in Salaat throughout the night called Lailatul Qadr <br>8 &<br>(27th night of Ramadhaan-the month of fasting and the 9th <br>S;6 <br>z<br>month of the Islamic calendar). It is also reported that if <br>somebody reads these two surahs, seventy virtues are <br>added to his account and seventy sins are condoned. <br>According to another riwaayat, if one reads these two <br>surahs, a reward equal to that of standing in salaat through- <br>out Lailatul Qadr is writtep for him. This is also mentioned <br>in Mazaahir. <br>Tirmidhi (Rahmatullah alaih) reports from Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho): \"Some sahabah pitched a tent, at a <br>place without knowing that there was a grave at that place. <br>All of a sudden, those who were putting up the tent heard <br>somebody reciting surah Tabarakal lazi. They reported the <br>matter to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who ex- <br>plained to them that this surah guards against Allah's chas- <br>tisement and ensures deliverance.\" <br>Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) would not go to sleep until he had <br>recited the surahs Alif Laam Meem-Sajdah and Tabarakal <br>lazi. <br>Khalid bin Ma'daan (Radhiyallaho anho) has said that <br>he had heard it narrated, \"There was a man who was a <br>great sinner, but he used to recite surah Sajdan. He never <br>read anything else. This surah spread its wings over that <br>man and submitted to Allah, '0, my Lord! this man used to <br>recite me very frequently'. So the intercession of that surah <br>was accepted. It was ordered that each sin in his account <br>should be substituted by a virtue.\" Khalid bin Ma'daan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) has also reported, \"This surah pleads <br>for its reader in the grave and says, '0, Allah! if I am con- <br>tained in Thy Book, then accept my intercession, otherwise <br>write me off from Thy Book. This surah appears in the form <br>of a bird, spreads its wings over the dead and guards him <br>against punishment in the grave.\" He has reported all these <br>merits for surah Tabarakal lazi as well. He himself would <br>never go to sleep unless he had read these two surahs. <br>Taa'oos (Rahmatullah alaih) has said, \"These two <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>surahs carry sixty virtues in excess of those carried by any <br>other surah.\" <br>The punishment in the grave is not an ordinary affair. <br>After death, the first stage that one has to pass through is <br>the grave. Whenever Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>stood by a grave, he used to weep so much that his beard <br>would become wet with tears. Somebody asked him why <br>he wept more at the mention of the grave than he did at the <br>mention of Heaven and Hell. He replied, \"I have heard <br>from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the grave <br>is the first stage towards the Hereafter. Whoever is saved <br>from chastisement in it, for him the subsequent events <br>become easy, and whoever is not saved from chastisement <br>in it, for him the coming events will be harsher still. And I <br>have also heard that no scene is more horrible than that of <br>the grave.\": <br>0,Allah! save us from this punishment through Thy <br>Mercy and Grace. <br>HADITH- 5 <br>I <br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Somebody asked <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as to which of <br>the acts is the most virtuous. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied <br>Jw ('al-haal wal-murta- <br>i <br>hil'). The man inquired, '0, Rasullulah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)! what is 'alah-a1 wal murtahil?' Rasu- <br>lallah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is that <br>particular reader of the Qur'an who starts reading from <br>the beginning and continues till he reaches its end, <br>and after the end, he starts at the beginning again. <br>Wherever he stops, he proceeds further.\" <br><br>Part I1 (Hadith 6 )  <br>The Arabic word (JW ('al-haal) means one who <br>reaches a halting place, and the word ($>I) <br>('al-murtahil') <br>means one who departs. In other words, as soon as a <br>reading of the Holy Qur'an is finished, one should start <br>again. And it should not be that when one reading is fin- <br>ished the other may be taken up later on. The term ($Jlj <br>('al-haal wal murtahil') is explained in a riwaayat in <br>Kanzul-Ummaal to mean (pllPSI) (al-khaatimatul miftaah) <br>ah<br>(one who concludes and opens), i.e. one who completes the <br>5 X <br>whole reading of the Holy Qur'an and then immediately <br>starts another. Probably this has led to the practice gener- <br>ally prevalent in our country, according to which the <br>reader while finishing the whole Qur'an does not stop after <br>reading the last surah but also reads from the beginning of <br>the Qur'an up to <br>Doing so has now become a mere <br>ritual and the people do not care to continue further and <br>complete the reading. This hadith teaches us that, as soon <br>as one reading of the Glorious Qur'an is completed, a fresh <br>reading should be taken up immediately and brought to <br>completion. It is written in Sharhul Ihya as well as in Alla- <br>mah Suyuti's Al-Itqan that according to Daarami whenever <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) read surah an-Naas <br>(the last surah), he would also read al-Baqarah up to i,j+ <br>after which he would offer the du'a meant to be read on <br>completion of a reading of the whole Qur'an. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Abu Musa Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Be watch- <br>ful towards the Qur'an. I swear by Him in Whose <br>hands my life is, that the Qur'an is apt to escape from <br>the hearts more rapidly than do the camels from their <br>strings.\" <br>If a man becomes neglectful in looking after an animal, <br>and the animal frees itself from the halter, it will bolt away. <br>Similarly if the Holy Qur'an is not looked after, it will not <br>be remembered and will be forgotten. The fact that the <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Holy Qur'an gets committed to memory is a distinct mir- <br>acle of the Book itself. Otherwise memorizing a book one- <br>half or even one-third of its size is not only difficult but <br>well-nigh impossible. Therefore, the fact that the Holy <br>Qur'an gets committed to memory is mentioned by <br>Almighty Allah as a Divine favour in surah al-Qamar, <br>where it is repeated over and over- <br>We have made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, So is <br>there any one who will remember? <br>The author of al-Jalalain writes that the interrogatory <br>clause in this ayat is in fact an imperative one. Thus <br>Almighty Allah has stressed over and over again the im- <br>portance of memorizing the Qur'an, but if we Muslims are <br>so perverse as to think that this act is useless and wasteful <br>of time and energy, this blunder on our part is sufficient to <br>justify our destruction. It is a matter of surprise indeed <br>that, when 'Uzair (Alayhis salaam) reproduced the Torah <br>from memory he was exalted to be called the \"Son of God;\" <br>poor indeed is the regard that we have for the blessing and <br>favour of Allah, that He has made the memorizing of the <br>Glorious Qur'an easy for all of us (and not only for an indi- <br>vidual as in the case of Torah). It is for such people that the <br>Qur'an says: <br>And those who dd wrong will come to know by what a <br>(Great) reverse they will be over-turned! <br>It is merely through the grace and blessing of Almighty <br>Allah that the Qur'an gets memorized, but afterwards, if a <br>person neglects it, he is made to forget it. There are severe <br>admonitions for those who forget the Glorious Qur'an after <br>having learnt it. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said, \"The sins of my ummat were shown <br>to me. I did not find any sin as great as that of forgetting the <br>Holy Qur'an after having read it. \"In another hadith it is <br>said tnat any one who forgets Qur'an after having read it, <br>will appear in the Court of Allah as a leper. According to a <br>riwaayat of Razeen (Rahmatullah alaih) in 'Jam'ul-Fa-<br>waa'id', the following ayat refer to it: <br>I* I \t<br>Part I1 (Hadith 7 )  <br>But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for <br>him is a narrowed life and We shall raise him up blind <br>on the Day of Judgement. He shall say: \"My Lord, why <br>hast Thou raised me blind, and I was a seeing one <br>indeed.\" He will say, \"Even so Our Commandments <br>came to thee, but thou didst neglect them; even thus <br>shalt thou be forsaken today.\" (XX: 126-6). <br>HADITH- 7 <br>Buraidah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"He who reads the <br>Qur'an so that he might thereby get something to eat <br>from the people, shall so appear on the Day of Judge- <br>ment that his face will only be a bone, on which there <br>will be no flesh. <br>This means that those who read the Glorious Qur'an in <br>order to fulfil the needs of this world will get no share in <br>the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has <br>said, \"We read the Holy Qur'an. There are amongst us <br>Arabs as well as non-Arabs. Go on reading the Qur'an as <br>you do it now. Shortly, there will rise people who will set <br>right the pronunciation of letters of the Qur'an as an arrow, <br>i.e., they will work hard to adorn it and spend hours in im- <br>proving the pronunciation of each and every letter. They <br>will take great pains over phonetics. But all this will be <br>with a worldly motive. They will be the least concerned <br>with the Hereafter.\" This hadith further signifies that mere <br>recitation in a pleasing voice is of no avail if there would <br>be no sincerity and if the purpose is only to earn worldly <br>benefit. \"There will be no flesh\" means that whea a man <br>makes the noblest of all things (i.e. the Qur'an) the means <br>for earning the inferior things of this world, the noblest of <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>all parts of the body, i.e. his face, will be deprived of its <br>beauty. <br>Once 'Imraan bin Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) hap- <br>pened to pass by a preacher who recited the Glorious <br>Qur'an and then begged of the people. He was grieved to <br>see this painful sight and recited 'Innaa lillaahi wa innaai- <br>laihi raaji-oon' (verily we are from Allah and will return to <br>Him). He said that he had heard from Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) that whoever recites the Glorious <br>Qur'an should beg whatever he needs only from Almighty <br>Allah. Shortly, there will come into existence a people who <br>will recite and then beg of the people. It is reported from <br>some scholars that the \"example of one who earns the <br>gains of this world through the knowledge of deen is like <br>that of one who cleans his shoes with his cheeks; the shoes <br>will no doubt be cleaned, but the act is most stupid. It is <br>such people who are referred to in the following ayat of the <br>Glorious Qur'an: <br>These are they who buy error at the price of guidance. <br>I <br>So their ,commerce doth not prosper, neither are they <br>guided. <br>Ubayy bin Ka'b (Radhiyallaho anho) has narrated, \"I <br>taught a surah of the Glorious Qur'an to a man who gave <br>me a bow as a gift. I mentioned this to Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>II <br>laho alaihe wasallam), who said that I had accepted a bow <br>from Hell.\" A similar, incident has been mentioned about <br>himself by 'Ubaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>I <br>whose case Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) he <br>I <br>said, \"You have hung between your shoulders a spark from <br>Hell.\" According to another riwaayat Rasulullah (Sallal-<br>laho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"If you are prepared to put <br>, <br>a yoke of Hell round your neck, you may accept it.\" <br>r <br>Now a word for such huffaaz who are working in <br>Qur'anic schools, only for the sake of money. It is humbly <br>requested that they should give a thoughtful consideration <br>to their status and responsibility. This unbecoming con-<br>I <br>duct on their part is being attacked and made an excuse by <br>some people for stopping the reading or memorizing of the <br>Glorious Qur'an. They alone are not responsible for the evil <br>consequences, but such huffaaz also share the responsibil- <br><br>Part I1 (Hadith 7) <br>ity for stopping the teaching of the Glorious Qur'an. These <br>huffaaz think that they are engaged in the propagation of <br>the Qur'an, but in reality they are obstructing it, through <br>their misconduct and bad intentions. The ulama have not <br>permitted the acceptance of salary for teaching the Glorious 9 1 <br>Qur'an so that it becomes the primary motive. In fact, the <br>3% <br>real motive of the teachers should only be to promote the <br>D b .  <br>education and propagation of knowlegde of the Qur'an. No tQ<br>S X<br>salary can be a return for the sublime act of teaching the <br>Qur'an. Such remuneration is on1 for meeting personal <br>needs and has been permitted wKen forced by circum- <br>stances, in case of dire necessity. <br><br>FINAL NOTE <br>The purpose of describing the beauties and virtues of <br>the Holy Qur'an in the foregoing pages is to cultivate a love <br>for it. Love for the Holy Qur'an is needed for developing a <br>love for Almighty Allah, and vice versa. Love for one leads <br>to love for the other. <br>The creation of man in this world is only for the pur- <br>pose of acquiring a realization of Allah, and all other cre- <br>ation is for the sake of man. As a Persian poet says: <br>The clouds, the winds, the moon, the sun and the sky <br>are constantly at work, <br>So that $ou earn your living and do not eat in forgetful- <br>ness <br>The whole creation is involved in working for you in <br>obedience, <br>The law of justice will not be fulfilled if you fail to <br>obey (Allah). <br>So man should l6arn a lesson from their punctuality <br>and obedience ,in their functions of rendering service to <br>him. <br>Sometimes, as a warning, temporary changes are <br>caused in their functions by Almighty Allah. There is no <br>rain when it should rain; no wind blows when it should <br>blow; similar changes are wrought in the moon and the sun <br>through their eclipses. In short, everything is subject to <br>some change for admonishing those who neglect their duty <br>to their Creator. How astonishing indeed that all these <br>things be made subservient to fulful man's needs, yet their <br>obedience does not lead man to his own submission to the <br>Creator. Love alone provides the best help for obedience <br>and submission to Almighty Allah. <br>L <br>, r <br>Part 111 (Final Note) <br>Verily, the lover submits to his beloved. <br>When a person falls in love with someone, submission <br>and obedience to the beloved becomes his habit and <br>second nature. Disobedience to the beloved becomes as <br>hard as it unwilling obedience to one whom one does not <br>love. <br>One way of developing love for someone is the obser- <br>vation of his beauty and excellence. This observation may <br>be through the physical senses or through inner perception. <br>If a look at a beautiful face can lead to spontaneous love, a <br>sweet heart-captivating voice can also sometimes produce a <br>magnetic effect. A Persian poet says: <br>Looks alone do not inspire love; <br>Often this wealth is attained through charming words. <br>Sometimes it is the sweetness of voice which draws <br>the heart unconsciously and sometimes it is the beauty and <br>wisdom of expression which causes one to fall in love. Ex-<br>perienced men have suggested that in order to develop <br>love, one should dwell upon the fine attributes of the be- <br>loved, and none other than the beloved should find a place <br>in one's heart. It is true even in the case of earthly love that <br>the sight of a beautiful face cr a hand urges one to see the <br>other parts of the body of the beloved, so that love may in- <br>crease and the yearning of the heart may be satisfied, but <br>the stage of satisfaction is never reached. As an Urdu poet <br>says: <br>The disease worsened as the treatment progressed. <br>If after sowing the seeds in a field, one does not care to <br>water it, no crop will grow there. Similarly, after falling in <br>love involuntarily, if one does not pay attention to the be- <br>loved, this love will vanish in course of time. But if one <br>I<br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>keeps on visualizing the charming features, the stature as <br>well as the gait and the manner of speaking of the beloved, <br>love will go on increasing every moment. <br>Unusual are the ways in the school of love, One who <br>I <br>learns his lesson gets no leave. <br>If you forget the lesson of love, there is a riddance for <br>you at once. But the more you learn it, the more you are en- <br>trapped. In the same way, if a man wants to develop love <br>with someone worthy of love, he should find out the exczl- <br>lence, the charms and the valued attributes of the beloved <br>and should not remain content with what he knows, but <br>should always be eager to know more about them. <br>When, even in the case of mortal beloved, the lover is <br>not satisfied with a partial view of the beloved, and is <br>always on the lookout for more chances to see as much of <br>the beloved as he can, then Almighty Allah, the Pure and <br>Sanctified, Who is the fountainhead of all elegance and <br>beauty, (and in fact there is no beauty in this world except <br>His) is certainly such a beloved Whose loveliness and per- <br>I <br>fection knows no bounds and is limitless. One of the mani- <br>festations of His utmost excellence is the Glorious Quran, <br>which is the Word of Allah Himself. What greater plasure <br>can there be for a lover of the Divine, than the fact that the <br>! <br>Qur'an is Allah's own Revelation. A poet says: <br>~ <br>!<br>'0, flower! how pleased am I with you, You have the <br>smell of someone (beloved). <br>Even if we leave aside the consideration that the Holy <br>Qur'an has its origin in Allah and is His attribute, the re- <br>lationship that the Qur'an has with Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is enough for a Muslim to adore it. Study <br>of the Qur'an itself makes one realise that there is no excel- <br>lence elsewhere that cannot be found in the Glorious <br>Qur'an. <br><br>Part 111 (Final Note) <br>A poet says: <br>W<br>V <br>The limits of sight are marrow and the flowers of your <br>beauty numerous; <br>> X  <br>He who plucks the flowers of your spring complains of <br>the inadequacy of his hold. <br>There is another verse to this effect: <br>How many of your graces can be adored; <br>Your charms are innumerable and my restless heart is <br>one. <br>It is evident to the careful reader of the above ahadith, <br>that there is hardly any important thing of this world to <br>which attention has not been drawn. Whatever taste for <br>love and beauty one may possess, its excellence and perfec- <br>tion will be found in the Qur'an. In the first hadith the ex- <br>cellence of the Glorious Qur'an has been established over <br>the beauty, as a whole or in substance, that lies in all <br>worldly things; against the infinite number of excellent at- <br>tributes that one can imagine, the Glorious Qur'an is found <br>to be superior and matchless in respect of all of them. <br>The Holy Qur'an is superior to all other lovable things, <br>taken individually or collectively in every respect. If one <br>loves somebody because of the innumerable benefits accru- <br>ing from him, Almighty Allah has promised (hadith 2) that <br>He will give to the reader of the Qur'an more than that <br>begged of Him by all other persons. <br>If somebody is adored for his personal greatness, at- <br>tainment or excellence, Almighty Allah has said (in the <br>same hadith) that the su eriority of the Qur'an over all <br>other discourses is like t f'~e superiority of Allah Himself <br>over His creation, of the master over his slaves and of the <br>possessor over those possessed. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>If anybody is fond of wealth, property, servants and <br>animals, and loves to rear animals of a particular kind, he <br>is warned (in hadith 3) that the knowledge of the Qur'an is <br>far more valuable than any number of good animals ac- <br>quired even without labour or crime. <br>If a mystic seeks piety and fear of Allah, and works <br>hard to acquire them, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said (hadith 4) that those who become proficient <br>in the study of the Qur'an, will be reckoned amongst the <br>angels. The piety of the angels cannot be excelled by any- <br>body, because they cannot pass even a moment in disobe- <br>dience to Allah. <br>Also if anybody takes pride in getting double the <br>reward or if he likes that his words should carry a double <br>weight, he should consider how even the reader who fal- <br>ters in his recitation gets double the reward. <br>Il any jealous person can delight only in evil conduct, <br>and jealousy has become a part and parcel of his nature <br>and he cannot give up this vice, he can be rightly jealous of <br>a hafiz whose excellence is worth being jealous of, as said <br>by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) (hadith 5). <br>Let one who relishes fruit and cannot live without it, <br>know that the Qur'an is like citron. If anybody is fond of <br>sweets, he should know that Qur'an is sweeter than dates. <br>(Hadith6 refers to this.) <br>If anybody is desirous of honour and dignity and <br>cannot resist being a member of some council, he should <br>know that the Qur'an e,xalts the rank of its reader, both in <br>this world as well as in the Hereafter. (This is mentioned in <br>hadith 7.) <br>If anybody wants a sincere and dedicated companion, <br>who should be ready to defend him in every dispute, he <br>should know that the Qur'an is ready to defend its devotee <br>in the court of the Emperor of all emperors (as mentioned <br>in hadith 8.) <br>If a seeker of subtleties devotes his life to the critical <br>study of various subjects, and appreciation of a delicate <br>point is sufficient to turn him away from the greatest pleas- <br>ure of this world, he should know that the body of the <br>Qur'an is a treasure full of subtleties (as described in <br>hadith 9). <br>~ <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>/ <br>I <br>, <br>I <br>l <br>I <br>I<br>I <br>I<br>4-<br>97 <br>Part 111(Final Note) <br>If <br>somebody attaches importance to discovering <br>hidden secrets, and considers that experience in the crimi- <br>nal investigation department is an accomplishment and de-<br>votes his life to acquiring it, he should know that the body <br>of the Holy Qur'an reveals those mysteries whose depths <br>are boundless and to which hadith 10 refers. <br>Also if one hankers after the construction of lofty <br>buildings and wants his special abode to be on the seventh <br>floor, then verily the Qur'an raises its devotee to the seven <br>thousandth floor in Paradise. <br>If anybody desires to do business which should bring <br>maximum profit with a minimum of labour, he should <br>know that the recitation of each letter of the Holy Qur'an <br>yields ten blessings (as referred to in Hadith 10). <br>If anybody hankers after a crown and a throne, and for <br>their sake fights battles in this world, he should consider <br>that the Qur'an gets for the parents of its devotees a crown <br>whose brilliance has no parellel in this world. (This is <br>mentioned in hadith 11.) <br>If there is any expert in feats of jugglery who can catch <br>a burning coal in his hand or can put a burning match-stick <br>in his mouth, he should realize that the Glorious Qur'an <br>provides safety even against the fire of Hell. (For this see <br>hadith 12.) <br>There are people who want to develop good relations <br>with government officers and take pride in relating how, as <br>a result of their recommendation to an officer, an accused <br>had not been punished but had been set free. For finding <br>access to these officers, they spend their time and money <br>everyday in flatteries and arrange dinners and so on. <br>Through the intercession of its devotees, the Glorious <br>Qur'an arranges deliverance of ten people who shall have <br>been condemned to Hell. (This is mentioned in hadith 13.) <br>Now let us consider hadith 14. If somebody is fond of <br>flowers and gardens and loves sweet smells, he should <br>realize that the Holy Qur'an has been compared to musk. If <br>someone loves perfumes and wants to bathe in dried musk, <br>then the example of the Glorious Qur'an is like a musk- <br>vase. This is only for illustration, otherwise musk has no <br>comparison with the fragance of the Holy Qur'an. The par- <br>ticles of this earth cannot be likened to the Heavenly ones. <br>A Persian Poet says: <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>That sprinkling of musk is in fact the act of your looks; <br>It is out of expediency that lovers accuse the Chinese <br>deer (reported to yield musk). <br>A person who is often beaten and works for fear of <br>punishment, and persuasion is of no avail to him, will be <br>benefited to know that one whose heart is devoid of the <br>Qur'an, is like a ruined house (as mentioned in hadith 15.) <br>If a devotee is in search of the best waq of all worships <br>and is careful to devote himself to those acts which brings <br>maximum of reward, he should know that recitation of the <br>Holy Qur'an is superior to all other forms of worship, and <br>it is specially mentioned in hadith 16 that it is superior to <br>nafl salaat, fasting, tasbeeh and tahleel' (acclamation). <br>Some people are deeply interested in pregnant ani- <br>mals, as they fetch more price than the ordinary ones. Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has specifically said <br>that the recitation of the Glorious Qur'an is far more pre- <br>cious than such animals (see hadith 17.) <br>Many people are always worried about their health. <br>They take exercise and bathe every day, they run or go out <br>for a walk in the morning. There are others who are given <br>to grief, worry and anxiety. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said that the surah Fatihah provides treat- <br>ment for every disease and the Holy Qur'an cures the ail- <br>ment of the hearts, as mentioned in hadith 19. <br>People take pride in so many things that it is difficult <br>to enumerate all these, for example, some boast of their lin- <br>eage or good habits, others of their popularity or foresight. <br>In fact, a thing of real pride is the Glorious Qur'an, which <br>possesses all beauty and perfection. <br>As a Persian verse goes: <br>\"What all the other beloveds possess collectively; You <br>alone possess all that.\" (For this see hadith 20.) <br>Many people are fond of accumulating wealth. For this <br>purpose, they practise miserliness in their food and dress, <br>Part 111 (Final Note) <br>undergo many hardships and develop a mania that is not <br>satisfied by any amount of wealth. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has advised us that the only thing that <br>should be treasured as much as possible is the Holy <br>Qur'an. No treasure of wealth is better than this. (Hadith 21 <br>refers to this.) <br>Similarly if anybody is fond of illumination and uses <br>ten electric bulbs to light up his room, he should know that <br>the Holy Qur'an provides the best of lights. <br>People earnestly desire to receive presents, and they <br>expect gifts from their friends every day. They increase <br>their sphere of acquaintance only with this motive. If <br>anyone of their friends does not send them their share of <br>fruit from his garden, they complain of him. They should <br>realise that the Holy Qur'an is the best giver of gifts. Peace <br>descends on those who recite the Glorious Qur'an. If you <br>are enamoured of someone because he sends you a present <br>everyday, then you would be pleased to know that the at- <br>tachment with the Glorious Qur'an will bring you precious <br>gifts (see hadith 22). <br>Some people fawn on a minister, so that he may men- <br>tion them in the court of the ruler, some flatter the subordi- <br>nates so that they may praise him before the officer. <br>Sometimes a person entreats others so that they may men- <br>tion his name in the presence of his beloved. Let all such <br>people learn how, through the Glorious Qur'an, they may <br>make themselves worthy of being mentioned by the be- <br>loved Lord Himself. (We find this mentioned in hadith 23.) <br>If a person is always eager to know about the most <br>favourite thing of the beloved, and he is prepared to per- <br>form even the most arduous task to procure it, he should <br>know that there is nothing more lovable to Allah than the <br>Glorious Qur'an. <br>Some people seek access to the court of the ruler and, <br>with this end in view, they plan and struggle all their lives. <br>Through the Holy Qur'an we can become the special <br>favourites of Almighty Allah, before Whom the greatest of <br>kings is completely helpless (see hadith 24.) <br>It is strange that in order to become a member of some <br>council, or to join the hunting party of some man in author- <br>ity, people make sacrifices of time, money and comfort. <br>They use all sorts of mean tactics for approaching them and <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>thereby spoil their own temporal as well as spiritual life, <br>only for the sake of gaining some false honours. Is it then <br>not necessary to make some effort to win the real honour, <br>and become a courtier of the Almighty Lord? If they can <br>spend their whole life for the vanity of this world, we must <br>spend at least a part of our lives for pleasing the very One <br>Who gave us this life. <br>If you are fond of 'Chistiyyat' and do not find solace <br>except in gatherings of men devotees, you should know <br>that gatherings for recitation of the Qur'an are far more en- <br>thralling and attract the ears of the most unmindful. <br>If you want to attract the attention of our Great Master, <br>you must devote yourself to the recitation of the Glorious <br>Qur'an (This is discussed in ahadith 25 and 26). <br>If we declare ourselves to be Muslims and also feel <br>proud of Islam, then we should know that it is the com- <br>mand of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the <br>Glorious Qur'an should be recited in a befitting manner. If <br>our Islam is not a mere declaration and it has really some- <br>thing to do with obedience to Allah and His Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), then we should realise that <br>Almighty Allah and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasil- <br>lam) have commanded the recitation of the Qur'an. <br>If you are a staunch nationalist and love a Turkish cap <br>because you consider it to be a part of Islamic dress, if you <br>are interested in national culture and its propagation by all <br>possible means, if you write articles in the newspapers for <br>this purpose and pass resolutions in public meetings, you <br>should know that Rasplullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has commanded us to do our best to propagate the Holy <br>Qur'an (see hadith 27.) <br>At this stage, it will not be out of place to express dis- <br>appointment about the attitude of our national leaders in <br>respect of the Qur'an. They do not assist in its propagation <br>but, in some ways, help in obstructing it. Learning the <br>Qur'an is looked upon by them as useless and a waste of <br>time and effort. It is also considered an act of mental waste <br>and fruitless toil. It may be that some of them are not in <br>favour of this attitude, but when a group of people are en- <br>gaged in anti-Qur'anic propaganda, silence on the part of <br>our national leaders is tantamount to helping them in the <br>crime. An Urdu poet says: <br><br>Part Ili (Final Note) <br>24 <br>We admit, you will not disregard us, but <br>We will be reduced to dust, before you become aware. <br>There are many who argue that the institution of teach- <br>ing and learning the Holy Qur'an is promoted by the relig- <br>ious teachers for earning their bread. This is a vehement <br>attack on the intention of all such teachers. Those who <br>make such accusations are responsible for this calumny, <br>which will have to be proved in the Hereafter. Such people <br>are humbly requested to consider the results of the efforts <br>of these so-called \"selfish teachers\" and also the would-be <br>results of their own unselfish proposals. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) has commanded us to propagate the <br>Holy Book. They should judge for themselves how far they <br>have personally contributed in carrying out the command <br>of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Their attention <br>is drawn to another misconception. Some people might <br>think that they are not a party to this anti-Quranic propa- <br>ganda and therefore remain unconcerned, but this cannot <br>save them from the wrath of Allah. <br>The Sahabah (~adhiyallaho anhum) said to Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"Shall we be destroyed while there are righteous per- <br>sons amongst us.\" <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Yes <br>(it will be SO), when evil shall have overwhelmed.\" There <br>is another hadith to the same effect, \"Almighty Allah or- <br>dered that a certain village should be overturned. Jibraa'eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) submitted that in that village there was a <br>person who had never committed any sin. Almighty Allah <br>said that it was true, but though he witnessed so much dis-<br>obedience to Me (around him), there never did appear a <br>frown on his face (in its disapproval)\". In fact, it is because <br>of these ahadith that the ulama do not hesitate to express <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>their disapproval when they see any disobedience to <br>Almighty Allah being committed. It is deplorable that some <br>of our so-called enlightened eople consider it to be nar- <br>rowmindedness on the part o !'ulama. This so-called broad- <br>mindedness on the part of such people does not absolve <br>them of their responsibility. They should understand that it <br>is not the duty of the ulama alone to check disobedience to <br>the Commandments of Allah. But it is the duty of every <br>Muslim who sees disobedience being committed and has <br>the power to stop it. Bilaal bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said, \"If evil deeds are committed secretly, only the <br>evil-doers suffer for it, but if they are committed openly, <br>and nobody prevents them, all the people are punished.\" <br>There are some who are fond of history, and travel to <br>consult old books of history wherever they may find them. <br>Such people had better devote themselves to the study of <br>the Qur'an, in which they will find an equivalent to all the <br>books that are admitted to be most authoritative on the past <br>ages. <br>If you want to acquire such a lofty status that even <br>Prophets be commanded to sit in your company and par- <br>ticipate in your gathering, you can do so through the Holy <br>Qur'an. (Hadith 29 refers to this.) <br>If you are so lazy that you cannot apply yourself to <br>hard work, even then you can earn an honourable status <br>witho-ut any labour by means of the Glorious Qur'an. You <br>should sit down and keep on listening silently to children <br>reciting the Qur'an in a school. Thereby you shall earn a.lot <br>of reward without any Pard work on your part. (This is re- <br>ferred to in hadith 30.) <br>If you are fond of variety, you can find it in the various <br>ideas and different subjects of the Holy Qur'an, some deal- <br>ing with mercy, others with chastisement, some relating to <br>different stories and others to various commandments, and <br>so on. You can also change your mode of recitation, low at <br>times and loud at others. (see hadith 31.) <br>If your sins have passed all limits and you believe, you <br>are to die one day. ahadith 32 to 34 will exhort you to lose <br>no time and start recitation of the Qur'an, because you can <br>never find such an influential intercessor, whose interces- <br>sion is certain to be accepted. On the other hand, if you are <br>very respectful and your sense of respect and honour <br>Part 111 (Final Note) <br>makes you avoid disputes with quarrelsome people, even <br>at the cost of your valuable rights, you should try to avoid <br>dispute with the Qur'an on the Day of Judgement, when it <br>will be the strongest complainant, whose contention will <br>be upheld and there will be nobody to defend the respon- 4 j<br>dent. <br>%k <br>If you are in need of a guide who would lead you to <br>the house of your beloved, and one would pay any price for <br>such a guidance, you should take to recitation of the Holy <br>Qur'an. Again if you want to safeguard yourself against im- <br>prisonment, you have no way out except recitation of the <br>Glorious Qur'an. <br>If vou want to acquire the knowledge of the Prophets <br>and vou are its devotee, hadith 35 shows that you can <br>spec:ialize in it through studv of the Qur'an. Similarly if <br>voi~are keen to develop the best of character, vou can do so <br>through rec:itation of the idol? Qur'an. <br>If you are very fo~~tl <br>of hilly places and they alone pro- <br>vide you with the best recireation and satisfaction, you <br>shoultl know that the tiolv Qur'an will provide recreation <br>for you on mounds of musk. even on the Day of Judgement, <br>when all creatures will be in a state of terror. (Hadith 36 <br>refers to this.) <br>If vou want to excel in the worship of Almighty Allah <br>by remaining busy it1 nafl salaat day and night, you should <br>know that teaching and lear~lirig the Holv Qur'an is a better <br>means of doing so. (See hadith 37.) <br>If votr want to keep yoi~rself anray from all troubles and <br>sava yourself from all anxieties, you can do so simply by <br>tlevoting yourself to the Holv Qur'an. (This is pointed out <br>in hatlith 40.) <br>If vo11 need to consult a physiciau, you should know <br>that si~mh E'atihah provides treatment of all diseases. vide <br>hi~tlith1 of part 2-Concluding Section. <br>If your numerous daily needs remain unfulfilled. why <br>should you not recite surnh Yaaseen. vide hadith 2 of part <br>2-(:o11c:ludirig Section. <br>I t  1-ou hanker after money,you had better read surah <br>12'aacli'al1'. (hadith 3 under Part 2-Concluding Section. <br>rcfttrs to this.) <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>If fear of chastisement in the grave haunts you, it can <br>also be relieved by the Glorious Qur'an, vide hadith 4 of <br>Part 11-Concluding Section. <br>If you are looking for an occupation that will absorb all <br>your time, you can find none better than the Holy Qur'an, <br>vide hadith 5 of Part 2-Concluding Section. <br>If one has acquired the wealth of the Glorious Qur'an, <br>he should carefully guard against its loss. To lose such <br>blessing, after having got it, is a great tragedy. He should <br>also abstain from such unworthy acts as might convert this <br>blessing into a curse (vide ahadith 6 and 7 of Part 2-Con- <br>cluding Section.) <br>I know that I am not competent enough to point out <br>the beauties of the Glorious Qur'an. I have explained them <br>according to my humble understanding. This has, however, <br>opened up a field of contemplation for scholars of deep <br>understanding. According to those who are well versed in <br>the art of love, the following five qualities of the beloved <br>incite love. First, it is the being of the beloved, which one <br>loves. The vicissitudes of time have no effect on the form of <br>the Glorious Qur'an; this guarantees its life and security. <br>Secondly, there should be a natural relationship between <br>the lover and the beloved. The Qur'an is the attribute of <br>Almighty Allah. The relationship between the Creator and <br>His creation, the Master and His servants, needs no expla- <br>nation. A Persian poet says: <br>The Creator of mankind has, with the life of Man, a <br>connection that is incomprehensible and unimagin- <br>able. <br>An Urdu poet says: <br>He has a relationship of friendliness with all; He <br>reaches out to the heart of each and everyone. <br>Part 111(Final Note) <br>The third, fourth and fifth qualities are beauty, perfec- <br>tion and benevolence, respectively. <br>If the foregoing ahadith are studied, keeping the above <br>three qualities in view, scholars will not feel contented <br>with what has been written by me, but they will them- <br>CP<br>selves arrive at the natural conclusion that all consider- <br>ations that promote love and liking, such as sense of i& <br>respect and status, fondness and constancy, beauty and <br>g <br>E$= <br>perfection, greatness and benevolence, peace and pleasure, <br>wealth and property, in short all such things as promote <br>love are pointed out by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to be possessed in a superb way by the Glorious <br>Qur'an. It is but natural that some of these virtues may be <br>hidden, and may not be directly visible as is the case with <br>most of the wordly valuables. We do not reject a delicious <br>fruit because of its rough outer cover. Nobody starts hating <br>his beloved lady because she wears a veil. He would try, by <br>all possible means, that his lady love unveils herself, but if <br>he does not succeed, the very sight of the veil will thrill <br>him, provided he is sure that it is his beloved indeed <br>behind it. No doubt, the Glorious Qur'an excels in all the <br>virtues that induce love, but if, for any reason, we fail to <br>understand and realize them, it will not be wise on our part <br>to become indifferent and disappointed. We should at- <br>tribute this failure to our own shortcomings and feel sorry <br>at our loss. We should contemplate more and more upon <br>the beauties of the Glorious Qur'an and become worthy of <br>understanding the Divine Book. <br>'Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) and Huzaifah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) have reported that, if hearts become clean of all <br>filth, then one would never be satiated with reading the <br>Holy Qur'an. Thaabit Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"I <br>put in a labour of twenty years to learn the Qur'an and it <br>has been giving me solace for t se twenty years.\" Thus it <br>is obvious that whoever repent ?over his sins, and then <br>meditates upon the Glorious Qur'an, will find it to possess <br>all beauties that all the beloveds collectively possess. I <br>wish I were also such a person. I, however, request the <br>readers that they should not look to the humble personality <br>of the writer, lest it should prevent them from realizing <br>their objective, but they should consider the subject-matter <br>and its source. I am only a means of drawing their attention <br>to these sublime matters. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>At this stage, it is just possible that some reader of this <br>book might be blessed by Almighty Allah with an urge to <br>learn the Holy Qur'an by heart and become a hafiz. If <br>anyone has a desire to make his child a hafiz, then no <br>special effort is required because this tender age itself is <br>most conducive to memorizing. But if some grown-up <br>person desires to memorize the Holy Qur'an, I suggest that <br>he should start with a special prayer, which was recom- <br>mended by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and has <br>been found effective by many people. It has been reported <br>by Tirmizi, Hakim and others as follows:- <br>Hadhrat Ibn 'Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that <br>he was once in the company of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) when Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>came in and said \"0,Prophet of Allah! you are dearer to <br>me than my father and mother. I try to memorize the <br>Qur'an but cannot do so, as it vanishes from my memory.\" <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I tell <br>you of a method that will benefit you as well as those to <br>whom it is conveyed by you? You will then be able to <br>retain whatever you learn.\" At the request of Hadhrat Ali <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said, \"When the night preceding Friday comes, rise <br>up in its last third portion, if possible, for that would be ex- <br>cellent, because this is the best part of the night, as this is <br>the time when angels descend and prayers are specially <br>granted at this hour. It was for this time that Hadhrat <br>Yaqub (Alayhis salaam) had been waiting when he had <br>said to his sons that he would, in the near future, pray to <br>his Lord for forgivenes,s for them. If it be difficult to get up <br>at that time, then you should do so in the middle part of <br>the night and if even that be not possible, offer the four <br>rak'aat in the early part of the night. After reciting surah <br>Fatihah in each rak'aat, surah Yaaseen should be recited in <br>the first rak'at, surah Dukhaan in the second, surah Alif <br>Laam Meem Sajdah in the third and surah Mulk in the <br>fourth. After completing at-tahiyaat (glorification of Allah <br>in the sitting posture in salat) you should praise and glorify <br>Almighty Allah abundantly, invoke peace and blessings on <br>me and on all the Prophets, and seek forgiveness for all be- <br>lievers and those Muslim brethern who have passed away <br>before you, and then recite the following du'a.\" <br>Before the du'a it may be mentioned that several forms <br>of 'hamd-o-thana' (praise and glorification), etc., which are <br>X <br><br>Part 111 (Final Note) <br>required to be recited before this du'a are reported in other <br>ahadith given in 'Shurooh-e-Hisn' and 'Munaajaat Maqbul'. <br>Those who can consult these books should themselves find <br>the details and thereby enrich their du'a. For the con-<br>venience of those who cannot read these books, brief ex- <br>tracts are given as under: <br>All praise be to Allah, the Lord of Worlds, praise up to <br>the (countless) number of His creatures, matching His <br>pleasure, weighty as the weight of His Throne and ex- <br>pansive as the ink (needed) for the writing of His <br>Words. 0 ,  Allah! I cannot comprehend the praise due <br>to Thee. Thou art as Thou praisest Thyself. 0,Allah! <br>send Thy peace, blessings and prosperity upon our <br>Chief, the Ummi (not taught by any one), the Hashi- <br>mite Prophet Muhammad and upon all the Prophets <br>and Apostles and upon Thy favourite angels. 0,Allah! <br>forgive us and our brethren who preceded us in faith, <br>and place not in our hearts any rancour towards those <br>who believe. 0,our Lord! You are Most Compassionate <br>and Most Merciful. 0 ,  Master of the Worlds! forgive <br>me and my parents and all believers and Muslims, <br>whether male or female. Verily, Thou art the Hearer <br>and Granter of our supplications. <br>After this, the following du'a which was taught by Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), as mentioned in the above hadith, should <br>be read: <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>'0, Allah! have mercy upon me, so that I always <br>abstain from sinful deeds as long as I am alive, be kind <br>to me so that I do not toil in vain pursuits, and bless <br>me with solace in that which pleases Thee. 0 ,  Allah! <br>the Originator of Heavens and Earth, Master of Glory <br>and Honour, Lord of such Majesty, attainment of <br>which cannot even be conceived. 0, Allah! the Most <br>Beneficent, I pray in the name of Thy Majesty and Ef- <br>fulgence of Thy Countenance, to impose upon by heart <br>the merqorizing of Thy Book, as Thou hast taught me <br>the same, and grant me such a manner of recitation as <br>pleases Thee. 0,Allah! the Originator of Heavens and <br>Earth, Master of Glory and Honour, Lord of such Maj- <br>esty, attainment of which cannot even be conceived! <br>0,Allah, the Most Beneficent I pray in the name of <br>Thy Majesty and Effulgence of Thy Countenance, to il- <br>lumine my visioq with the noor of Thy Book, bless my <br>tongue with a flow in its reading, and through its bles- <br>sing remove heaviness of my heart, open my mind, and <br>wash away (the sins of) my body. Certainly there is <br>none except Thee to support me in the cause of truth, <br>and none except Thee can fulfil this desire of mine. <br>There can be no safeguard (against evil) nor any power <br>(over virtue) except with tlle help of Allah, the Most <br>High, the Most Great. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) further said to <br>Hadhrat Ali-(Radhiyallaho anho), \"Repeat this act for three, <br>five or seven Fridays. If Allah so wills, your prayer will <br>.certainly be granted. I swear by Him Who made me Prophet <br>that acceptance of His prayer will never be missed by any <br>believer.'. <br>Part III (Final Note) <br>Ibn 'Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that hardly had <br>five or seven Fridays passed when Hadhrat 'Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) came to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and said, \"Previously I used to learn about four ayaat but I <br>was not able to retain them, and now I learn about forty <br>and I can remember them as clearly as if I have the Qur'an <br>open before me. Previously when I heard a hadith and then <br>repeated it I could not retain it, and now I hear ahadith <br>and, when I narrate them to others, I do not miss a single <br>word.\" <br>May Almighty Allah bless me and you with memoriz- <br>ing of the Glorious Qur'an and the 'ahadith' by the grace of <br>His Prophet's beneficence. <br>0,Almighty Allah! by 'Thy Mercy, send Thy Peace and <br>blessings on Mohammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>the best of Thy creation and our Chief. and on his <br>Family and on his Companions. Thou art the Most <br>Compassionate of all the Most Merciful ones. <br><br>- - <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>PART 4 <br>COMPLEMENTARY NOTE <br>The fortv ahadith given in the foregoing pages relate to <br>a special subject-matter and as such it has not bee11 poss- <br>ible to maintain brevity. These days, we have become easy- <br>going and it is difficult to bear even slight hardships in the <br>cause of religion. In view of this, I give here another set of <br>I <br>forty ahadith, which are very brief and are reported at one <br>place from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The <br>beauty about it is that it embraces all the vital teachings of <br>Islam and is unique in this respect. It is given in 'Kanzul- <br>Ummaal' and ascribed to a group of the earliest scholars of <br>hadith. Of the scholars of later times, Maulana Qutbuddin <br>Muha~ir Makki (Rahmatullah alaih) has also mentioned it. <br>Let those having a zeal for Islam commit at least this hadith <br>to memorv and earn a bounteous reward for doing so little. <br>This hadith is given below: <br>. . <br>JG~<br>A\\<br>& <br>.&<br>s j y \\<br>- ,<br>s ' \\ d g &  <br>oE <br>&L JG il A& <br>:JG <br>, <br>.. <br>0 # <br>&\\ J>jk & L, &j a\\3j$> <br>> JG <br>,.$I <br>&j dl,2<br>,<br> &\\, <br>jjl <br>A& >$ JI<br>.\".. <br>P o , $  <br>r s  <br>JFJ I& <br>3 . -<br>B <br>j - s e . .  <br>,<br> <br>, < <br>a\\, &I YI, d\\y<br>, a\\ <br>a\\, 'Jw &I 2 +, !><br>* <br>, <br>, ig?j\\23, * j  <br>*,g &L$3;jyJ\\2,A\\<br>' I <br>$, t%2 Sji9 <br>dK L\\ dlB <br>s<br>o <br>-<br>$\\, <br>p,JL <br>9 <, <br>PJ <br>J <br>I <br>9 l<br>p+ <br>+rq 3 3 y ;  10 g 2 &-P~<br>Jl; $y, <br>441; &y, <br>-,. <br>4, <br>+ o y ,<br>, ,  , <br>': ljW+~u', <br>gig <br>+&, AT,<br>$$u';<br>. <br>0 I <br>JJJ <br>a \\  3,<br>* <br>&j, g<br>, , <br>\"i <br>wy; <br>&J& D <br>s y ,  <br>D <br>., <br>9 &j 3~&<br>py, &,GI <br>&y, <br>&y, <br>@\\ <br>. <br>I <br>, O  <br>'Jw +\\ *I, <br>s p y \\  3-. -6, -, , &y, <br>$ &,+D,+y,<br>* <br>< <br>I <br>, D <br>,... <br>Part IV (Complementary Note) <br>Salman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that he had asked <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) about the forty<br>'ahadith' concerning which he had said that, if anyone<br>from amongst his Ummat memorized them, he would enter <br>Paradise. I asked which ahaadith are they? Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: \"You should believe: <br>(1)In Allah, i.e. in His Person and Attributes; and <br>(2) The Last Day; and <br>(3)The Angels; and <br>(4)The earlier Divine Books; and <br>(5)All the Prophets; and <br>(6)The rising after death; and <br>(7) The destiny, i.e. all that is good or bad is from <br>Allah; and <br>(8)That you bear witness that there is none worthy of <br>worship except Allah, and that Mohammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) is His Messenger; and <br>(9)That at the time of each salaat you make good <br>salaat at its proper time after performing a perfect <br>wudhu; and perfect wudhu is one performed with <br>due regard even to adaab (due respects) and mus- <br>tahabbaat (plural of mustahab-desirable action).<br>Wudhu should preferably be performed afresh at <br>the time of each salaat, although the previous<br>wudhu subsists, and this is mustahab. To make <br>good salaat means to be mindful of its conlponent <br>parts like fardh, sunnat and mustahab. In another <br>hadith, it is said that during salaat the rows should <br>be straight, i.e. the rows should not be curved and <br>there should be no unoccupied space between <br>them. This is also included in the meaning of es- <br>tablishing salaat. <br>Part IV (Complementary Note) <br>(10)Pay the Zakaat (obligatory charity on wealth \t ex-<br>ceeding a prescribed limit) and <br>(11)Fast during the month of ,Ramadhan; and <br>(12)Perform Hajj if you have wealth; <br>The availability of wealth has particularly been men- <br>tioned, because want of wealth is generally made an <br>excuse for non-performance of Hajj. Otherwise it is evi- <br>dent that the other prerequisites that make the Hajj <br>obligatory should also exist. <br>(13)You should perform the twelve raka'aat sunnat-e- <br>mu'akkadah salaat' every day; (According to other <br>ahadith these twelve raka'aat are detailed as two <br>raka'aat before the two fardh raka'aat of Fajr salaat, <br>four before and two raka'aat after the four fardh ra- <br>ka'aat of Zohr, two after the three fardh raka'aat of <br>Maghrib, and two after the four fardh raka'aat of <br>Ishaa'.). <br>(14)You should never miss the Witr salaat at night; <br>Witr salaat is waajib (compulsory, but less than <br>fardh and more important than sunnat) and is, <br>therefore, specially emphasized. <br>(15)You should ascribe no partners unto Allah; <br>(16)You should not disobey your parents; <br>, <br>(17) You should not devour the property of orphans <br>unjustly; (Unjustly implies that there is no harm in <br>using the belongings of an orphan in a lawful <br>manner, as is the case under certain circum-<br>stances.) <br>(18)You should not drink wine; <br>(19)You should not commit adultery; <br>(20)You should not indulge in false oaths; <br>(21)You should not give false evidence; <br>(22)You should not yield to your base desires; <br>(23)You should not backbite on a Muslim brother; <br>Part IV [Complementary Note) <br>(24)You \t should not bring a false charge against a <br>chaste woman (or a chaste man); <br>(25)You should not bear ill-will towards your Muslim <br>brethren; <br>a c <br>.c a<br>C .=<br>(26)You should not indulge in useless amusements; <br>O \"l <br>(27)You should not join the idle spectators; \t<br>M O<br>s* <br>(28)You s:iould \t not call a short-statured person \"0. 55 <br>you short-statured one!\" with the intention of <br>finding fault with him; (there is no harm if a <br>person is called by a derogatory nickname which <br>has become associated with him, provided the <br>nickname is used neither as a taunt nor as a term <br>of abuse.

companions and those who follow <br>him in upholding the cause of the right religion.\" <br>The indifference of Muslims towards practising Islam <br>these days is too well known. So much so that even Salaat, <br>which is the most important pillar of Islam (after Imaan) <br>and the first and the foremost thing to be reckoned on the <br>Day of Judgement, is being badly neglected. Although every <br>call to 'Islam', nowadays, seems to be only a cry in the wil- <br>derness, yet experience shows that efforts in this direction <br>are not altogether fruitless. The glorious words of the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) are sure to benefit <br>those with a receptive and submissive frame of mind. With <br>this idea in view and to comply with the long-standing re- <br>quest of some of my dear friends, I have taken upon myself <br>to write this booklet, which is the second of the series on <br>'Tabligh', the first one being \"Virtues of Tabligh.\" <br>And my success can only come from Allah! And in <br>Him I trust and unto Him I turn .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . (XI:88) <br><br>I<br>I <br>I <br>1i <br>i <br>I <br>i<br>L <br>II<br>FOREWORD <br>The present-day Muslims, in respect of their behaviour <br>towards Salaat, can be divided into three groups. A large <br>number among them is totally unmindful of Salaat. Quite a <br>few observe their Salaat, but are not particular about <br>Jamaat. Then there are those who are regular in their Salaat <br>(with Jamaat), but their Salaat is devoid of the care and <br>thoroughness which it demands. I have divided the book <br>into three parts to suit the requirements of each group. In <br>each part, the illustrious Ahaadith of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) are quoted with their simple ig<br>translation. The translation is idiomatic and not literal. Ex-<br>planatory notes have been added wherever necessary. The <br>names of the books of Hadith from which the quotatims <br>are taken have also been mentioned for reference. <br><br>PART I <br>IMPORTANCE OF SALAAT <br>There are two Chapters in this <br>The first one is or1 '1111- <br>portance of salaat, and the second of 'Warning and Re- <br>proach' for those who neglect or discard salaat. <br><br>CHAPTER 1 <br>THE REWARDS OF SALAAT <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: <br>\"Islan~ is founded on five pillars: bearing witness that <br>there is no god but Allah, and Muhanlmad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is His servant and apostle: estahlishmerlt <br>of salaat: paying of Zakaat; pertorrnance of Hajj: axri fastirig <br>in Kamadhaan.\" <br>The Prophe! (Sallallaho alaihe u~asallam) has com-<br>pared Islam to a canopy resting on five supports. The Kali- <br>mah is the central support and the other four pillars of <br>Islam are. so to say, the remaining four supports. one at <br>each corner of the canopy. Without the central support, the <br>canopy cannot possibly stand. and if any one of the corner <br>supports is missing a collapse will result in the defective <br>corner. Now, let us judge for ourselves how far we have <br>kept up the canopv of Islam. Is there really any pillar that <br>is being held in its proper place? <br>L <br>The five pillars of Islam mentioned in this Hadith sig- <br>nifv the most essential duties of a Muslim. Although a <br>hluslim cannot do without any one of them, vet salaat in <br>Isldrn ctccupies a position next onlv to Ilnaan. Hadhrat Ab-<br>dullah bin Mas'ood (Kadhi~allaho <br>anho) savs: <br>\"Once, I inquired of tht: tioly Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), which act (of man) was the dearest to <br>Allah. The Prophet replied, 'saiaat'. I then inquired which <br>act came next (in order of merit) and the Prophet replied, <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>'Kindness to parents'. I again asked what was next and he <br>answered 'Jihaad'.\" <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted this <br>Hadith in support of the belief that salaat is the most inl- <br>portant religious duty after Imaan. This is further corrobo- <br>rated by a hadith, in which the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the best of all that has been ordained by <br>Allah.\" <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>out of his house. It was autumn and the leaves were falling <br>off the trees. He caught hold of a branch of a tree and its <br>leaves began to drop in large number. At this he remarked, <br>'0,Abu Zar! (Radhiyallaho anho) when a Muslim offers his <br>salaat to please Allah, his sins are shed awav from him just <br>as these leaves are falling off this tree.\" <br>In autumn, usually, the leaves of the trees fall in large <br>numbers, so much so that on some trees not a single leaf is <br>left behind. The same is the effect of salaat performed with <br>sincerity and devotion. All the sins of the person offering <br>salaat are wiped off. It should, however, be remembered <br>that according to the verdict of the theologians, it is only <br>the saghaa'ir (minor sins) that are forgiven by the perform- <br>ance of salaat and other services. The kabaa'ir (major sins) <br>are r,ot pardoned without repentance. We should, there- <br>fore, in addition to saying salaat, be particular about doing <br>taubah (repentance) and istighfaar (seeking forgiveness). <br>AHah may, however, pardon, by His bountiful Grace, even <br>the kabaa'ir of any person because of his salaat. <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Abu Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"I was <br>once sitting under a tree with Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyal- <br>!ah0 anho). He caught hold of a dry branch of the tree and <br>shook it till all its leaves fell off. He then said to me, \"0, <br>Abu Uthman! (Radhiyallaho anho) Will you not ask me <br>why I am doing this?\" \"Do tell me,\" I entreated. He said, <br>\"The Apostle of Allah had done exactly like this before me, <br>while I was with him under a tree. He caught a dry branch <br>of it and shook it, till all its leaves fell off\". At this he said: <br>'0, Salmaan! (Radhiyallaho anho) will you not ask me why <br>I am doing this?' I replied: 'Do tell me why you are doing <br>this?' He remarked: \"Verily when a Muslim takes wudhu <br>properly and then observes his salaat five times a day, his <br>sins fall off just as these leaves have fallen off. He then re- <br>cited the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>\"Establish salaat at the two ends of the day, and at the <br>approaches of the night. Verily, good deeds annul ill <br>deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. (XI: 114)\" <br>The behaviour of Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in the above hadith displays the profound love <br>which the Sahabah had for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>wasallam). They would often cherish the sweet memories <br>of the time when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was living among them. They would, while quoting him, <br>enact exactly what they had seen him doing at a particular <br>moment. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the traditions of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which deal <br>with the importance of salaat and which declare forgive- <br>ness for those who guard it. As had already been said <br>before, the theologians restrict this declaration of forgive- <br>ness to saghaa'ir (minor sins) only, but in the text of the <br>hadith there is no such restriction. My learned father gave <br>me two reasons for this. Firstly, it does not really become a <br>Muslim to commit any of the kabaa'ir (major sins). If per- <br>chance any such sins are committed by him, he cannot rest <br>in peace (due to inherent fear of Allah in him) until he <br>washes them with his tears of repentance in crying before <br>Allah. Secondly, the person who performs his salaat with <br>sincerity and thoroughness is very likely to do istighfaar <br>quite a number of times daily. Look for instance at the clos- <br>ing prayer of salaat itself, viz: <br>\"0,My Lord! I have wronged my soul a great wrong, <br>and none forgiveth sins save Thou alone. Then forgive <br>me and have mercy on me. Verily, Thou art the For- <br>giving, the Merciful.\" <br>In the above hadith, mention is made of wudhu to be <br>done properlv. We should, therefore, be sure of the regu- <br>lations about wudhu and try to observe all of these. For <br>example. take the case of miswaak. It is sunnat of wudhu, <br>but is very often neglected. It is said in a hadith that the <br>salaat offered after doing ~nisivaak is seventy times superior <br>to the salaat ~ ~ i t h o u t  <br>miswaak. In another hadith, use of <br>misuraak has been enjoined verv stronglv, and the follo~v- <br>irig benefits are attributed to it:- <br>\"It cleanses and sweetens the mouth and checks its <br>bad smell.\" <br>\"It is a cause of Allah's pleasure and a blow to the <br>Ilevil.\" <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Saiaat <br>\"Allah and his angels love the person doing miswaak.\" <br>\"It strengthens the gums and improves eye-sight.\" <br>\"It is a purge against bile and phlegm.\" <br>To crown all, \"It is a sunnah i.e. the practice of our be- <br>loved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>As many as seventy virtues of the n~iswaak have been <br>enumerated by the theologians. It is said that a person in <br>the habit of miswaak dies with the Kalimah on his lips. <br>The rewards of taking wudhu properly are very many. It is <br>mentioned in ahaadith that the parts of body washed in <br>wudhu shall glitter on the Day of Judgement and, by this <br>(distinction), the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will <br>at once recognise his followers. <br>Hadith.-IV(a) <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>asked his companions, 'Do you believe that dirt can <br>remain on a person bathing five times a day in a brook <br>running in front of his door?' 'No', replied the compan- <br>ions, 'No dirt can remain on his body.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'So, exactly <br>similar is the effect of salaat offered five times a day. <br>With the Grace of Allah. it washes away all the sins'.\" <br>Hadith.-IV(b) <br>\"Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>\"The likeness of five times daily salaat is as the like- <br>ness of a deep brook running in front of the door of a <br>person who bathes therein five times a day.\" <br>Running water is generally free from dirt, and the <br>deeper it runs the cleaner and purer it is. A bath in such <br>water surely removes dirt from the body and makes it <br>clean. Salaat offered with due regard for its essentials like- <br>wise cleanses the soul of all sins. There are several ahaa- <br>dith of the same meaning, though with slight variations in <br>expression, narrate& by different companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed <br>Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>'Each of the five salaats expiates the sins committed <br>since the salaat preceding it. To explain. let us take the <br>case of a person working in a factory. His job is such <br>that his body gets covered with dust. But there are five <br>streams of running water in between the factory and <br>his house and, on his return from the job, he takes a <br>bath in each stream. The effect of five times daily <br>salaat is quite similar. Any sins of omission and com- <br>mission between two salaats are forgiven on account of <br>'istighfaar and taubah in each salaat.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) through such <br>parables, aims at impressing that salaat has the wonderful <br>power of removing the sins. If we fail to avail of Allah's <br>mercy, surely we ourselves are the losers. <br>To err is human. We are likely to commit innumerable <br>acts of displeasing Allah and deserve thereby. His wrath <br>and punishment, but look how relenting our dear Allah is! <br>He has most graciously shown us the way to earn His <br>mercy and forgiveness. It is a great pity if we do not avail of <br>this great favour. Our Allah is always eager to show us His <br>mercy on very small grounds. It is said in a hadith, that if a <br>person goes to bed with the intention of getting up for Ta- <br>hajjud and perchance does not wake up, he receives the <br>full reward for Tahajjud, although he has been enjoying his <br>sleep at the time of Tahajjud. How boundless is the grace of <br>Allah and what a tremendous loss and deprivation if we do <br>not receive blessings from such a Giver. <br><br>i <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>\"Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that, <br>wvenever the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>h ppened to face any difficulty, he would at once <br>r9sort to salaat.\" <br>0,<br>vr B <br>P d  <br>Salaat is a great blessing of Allah. To resort to salaat at <br>the time of worry is to hasten towards His mercy, and <br>when Allah's mercy comes to rescue, there can remain no <br>trace of any worry. There are many traditions concerning <br>this practice of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Similar was the practice of his companions, who fol- <br>lowed him in the minutest detail. Hadhrat Abu Darda <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Whenever a strong wind blew, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would immedi- <br>ately enter the musjid and would not leave until the wind <br>had subsided. Similarly, at the time of a solar or lunar <br>eclipse, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would at <br>I \t<br>once start offering salaat. Hadhrat Suhaib (Radhiyallaho <br>I \t<br>anho) was informed by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that all the previous Apostles of Allah (peace be <br>upon them) also used to resort to salaat in all adversities. <br>Hadhrat Ibno Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was once on <br>journey. On his way he got the news of the death of his <br>I \t<br>son. He got down from his camel and offered two rakaat of <br>salaat, praying in Tashahhud for a long time. He then re- <br>cited 'Innaa liliaahi wa innaallaihi raaji-oon' and said, \"I <br>have done what Allah has ordered us to do in His Holy <br>Book i.e.: <br>!p\\j+I*\\, <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat\" (11: 45). <br>Another similar story is narrated about him. He was on <br>a journey when he received the news about the death of his <br>brother Quthum. He descended from his camel by the road- <br>side, and performed two rakaats of salaat and kept praying <br>in Tashahhud for a long time. After finishing his salaat, he <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>rode his camel reciting the following verse of the Holy <br>Qur'an: <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat, and truly <br>it is indeed hard except to the humble minded.\" <br>(11:45). <br>There is yet another story about him. On hearing of the <br>death of a wife of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), he fell down prostrate. When somebody asked him <br>the reason he said, \"Our dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had enjoined on us to prostrate (in salaat) when- <br>ever a calamity were to befall us. What calamity can be <br>greater than the death of the Ummul-Mo'mineen?\" <br>When Hadhrat Ubaada (Radhiyallaho anho) was about <br>to breathe his last, he said to the people around him, \"I <br>prohibit one and all from crying over me. When my soul <br>departs, I ask every one to perform wudhu, observing all its <br>essentials, and to go to the musjid and pray for my forgive- <br>ness, because our Gracious Allah has enjoined on us to <br>\"Seek help with patience and salaat.\" After that, lay me <br>down in the pit of my grave.\" <br>Hadhrat Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"Once it <br>became very dark during the day in Madina. I hurriedly <br>went to Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) to know if he <br>had ever experienced similar conditions during the life- <br>time of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He <br>said to me. \"M'aathallaah! During those blessed days, <br>whenever the wind blew strong, we would hurry to the <br>musjid lest it should be the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Salaam (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that whenever the members of the Prophet's family <br>were hardpressed in any way, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would enjoin upon then1 to say salaat, <br>and would recite the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be thyself <br>constant therein. We ask not of thee to provide suste- <br>nance. We provide it for thee. And the Hereafter is for <br>the righteousness.\" <br>(XX: 132). <br>It is said in a hadith that when somebody is confronted <br>with a need, whether pertaining to this life or the Hereafter, <br>or whether it concerns Allah or a mortal, he should per- <br>form a perfect wudhu, offer salaat of two rakaats, glorify <br>Allah, then ask blessing for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and then pray as under: <br>0,<br>k\", m <br>\"There is no god save Allah-the Clement-the Bouqti-<br>ful. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the tremendous <br>throne. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I ask <br>Thee all that leadeth to Thy Mercy and deserveth Thy <br>forgiveness. I ask Thee abundance in all that is good <br>and refuge from all that is evil. Leave me no sin but <br>Thou pardonest it, and no distress but Thou removest <br>it, and no need but Thou fulfillest it. 0,most Merciful <br>of those who show mercy!\" <br>Wahb bin Munabbih writes: \"Have your needs fulfilled <br>by Allah through salaat. In the good old time, if a calamity <br>befell the people, they would hurry towards salaat.\" It is <br>said that in Koofah there was a porter who was well known <br>for his honesty. People trusted him with their valuables <br>and money, which he carried from one place to another. <br>Once he wps on his usual errand when a person-met him <br>on the wayland asked him about his destination. When the <br>porter gave him the required information, k s a i d ,  \"I am <br>also bound for the same destination. If I could walk, I <br>would have accompanied you on foot. Will you kindly give <br>me a lift on your mule for one dinaar?\" The porter agreed <br>and allowed him to share the mule with him. They came to <br>a crossing on the way. The person said, 'Now, which road <br>will you take?' 'The main road, of course,' replied the <br>porter. The person said, 'No, brother. We should go by the <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>other road which is a shortcut and there is plenty of grass <br>enroute to feed the animal.' The porter said, 'I have never <br>been on this path.' The person remarked, 'But I have travel- <br>led by this route quite often'. The porter believed him and <br>put the animal on that path. After some distance, the path <br>ended in a terrifying forest where a large number of dead <br>bodies were lying about. All of a sudden the person <br>jumped down from the mule and took out his knife with <br>the intention of slaying the porter. 'Hold your hand', <br>shouted the porter, 'Take the animal and its load, but do <br>not kill me'. The person refused to listen to his entreaty <br>and swore that he would first kill the porter and then take <br>possession of the animal and the goads. Seeing that his en- <br>treaties fell on deaf ears and that his cruel heart would not <br>melt, the porter said to him, 'All right if you must kill me, <br>then permit to say my salaat of only two rakaats.' The <br>person agreed and remarked, 'You can please yourself. All <br>the dead you see over here made the same request, but <br>their salaat was of no avail to them.' The porter started the <br>salaat, but could not recollect any soorah to connect with <br>the Fatihah, in spite of his best efforts. Meanwhile the <br>person grew impatient and pressed him hard to hurry up <br>with the salaat. All of a sudden the following verse flashed <br>to his mind: <br>'Is it not He Who answereth the wronged one when he <br>crieth unto Him, and removeth the evil. .. (XXVII-62). <br>The porter was reciting the verse and the tears welled <br>up in his eyes, when a horseman suddenly appeared on the <br>scene. He was wearing a glittering helmet and held a spear <br>in his hand. He pierced the body of the pitiless rogue with <br>his spear and killed him there and then. A flame of fire <br>rose from the spot where the dead body fell. The porter fell <br>down prostrate and thanked Allah. After finishing his <br>salaat, he ran towards the horseman and requested him to <br>disclose his identity. He replied, 'I am a slave to Him who <br>answereth the wronged one. You are now safe and can go <br>wherever you like.' Saying this, the horseman rode away <br>and disappeared. \" <br>Indeed salaat is a tremendous asset. Besides pleasing <br>Allah it often gets us deliverence from the calamities of this <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>life and provides us with tranquility and eace of mind. <br>Ibn Seereen writes: \"If I be allowed to c Eoose between <br>Paradise and salaat of two rakaats, I would prefer salaat. <br>The reason is quite clear. Paradise is for my own pleasure <br>while salaat is for the pleasure of my dear Lord.\" The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: \"Enviable is <br>the lot of that Muslim who is with least encumbrance, <br>whose main fortune is salaat, who remains content with <br>humble provision throughout his life, who worshi s his <br>Lord in a dutiful manner, who lives a nameless li e and <br>P<br>who dies an early death, with very little to bequeath and <br>very few to mourn him.\" In another hadith, the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said: 'Offer your salaat at your homes quite frequently, so <br>that these may be blessed with Allah's Grace and Mercy.\" <br>\"Abu Muslim narrates: I went to see Abu Umaamah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) while he was in the musjid. I <br>asked him if he had really heard the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"When a person per- <br>forms wudhu with right performance and then says his <br>fardh salaat, Allah forgives him all the sins committed <br>that day by his feet in going towards evil, by his hands <br>in doing evil, by his ears in listening to evil, by his <br>eyes in looking at evil and by his heart in thinking of <br>evil.' He replied, 'By Allah, I have heard these words <br>from the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>again and again.\" <br>Many of the companions have narrated this Hadith <br>with slight variations. Those endowed with the power of <br>Kashf can even witness the sins being shed. It is said of <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Imam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) that he could tell <br>from the water falling down from the limbs of the person <br>performing wudhu as to which sins had been washed off <br>therewith. In a narration by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have warned against being wrong-headed in com- <br>mitting sins in the hope of getting them redeemed through <br>salaat. We have, really, no ground to behave as such on <br>this account. After all, what is the quality of the salaat that <br>we offer? If Allah merely absolves us of our obligation it is <br>His very special favour and grace. Again it is the height of <br>ingratitude to disobey Allah just because He is Clement, <br>Merciful and Forgiving. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"Two persons of one clan came to Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and embraced Islam at one and the <br>same time. One of these was martyred in a battle and <br>the other died a year later, Hadhrat Talha bin Ubaidul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he saw in his dream <br>that the person who had died later was admitted into <br>Paradise before the martyr. This surprised him. I do <br>not recollect whether it was he or somebody else who <br>narrated this dream. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thereupon remarked: \"Has not the person <br>dying later fasted for one additional month of Rama- <br>dhaan, and has he not offered six thousand or odd ra- <br>kaats of salaat more during the year he lived after the <br>martyr?\" <br>Really, we do not know how valuable salaat is! The <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was often heard <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>2 3 <br>saying, \"The comfort of my eyes is in salaat.\" This is an ex- <br>pression of his profound love for salaat. As such, what else <br>can be more valuable than salaat? <br>Hadith.VII1 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"At the approach of the hour of a salaat, an <br>Angel is deputed to proclaim, 'Arise, 0 Children of <br>Aadam! and extinguish the fire that you have (by com- <br>mitting sins) kindled to burn yourselves. So, the <br>people rise up, perform wudhu and offer their Zuhr <br>prayer. This causes forgiveness of their sins committed <br>since day-break. The same is repeated at Asr, Maghrib <br>and Ishaa. After Ishaa people go to bed, but there are <br>some who busy themselves in good, while some others <br>in evil deeds. <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"After <br>Ishaa the people get divided into three groups. There are <br>some for whom the night is a source of blessing and gain. <br>They are those who spend it in the worship of Allah, while <br>other people are asleep. For them the night brings great <br>reward from their Lord. There are others who turn their <br>night into a burden and curse for themselves, for they in- <br>dulge in various dark deeds in the dead of night. To them <br>the night brings woe and misery. There is the third group <br>of people who go to bed immediately after Ishaa; they <br>neither gain nor lose.\" <br>Hadith.1X <br>djG 5, JG <br>I j&; j G  JG <br>A, &j gj$ hij &i2 <br>O<br>,<br> <br>,J+<br>3. ai <br>..A@, +,& <br>&i 3 b$,J&, <br>*+<br>>f! <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Hadbrat Abu Qataadah bin Rab'iyy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"He heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, Allah has said, \"0, Muhammad! I <br>have ordained five times daily salaat for thy followers. <br>I have made a covenant with myself that whosoever is <br>regular in performing his salaat at its fixed hour, he <br>shall be admitted into the Paradise. Those of thy fol- <br>lowers who do not guard their salaat, are not included <br>in this covenant.\" <br>In another hadith, it is said that Allah has ordained <br>five times salaat and whosoever is mindful of his salaat, by <br>doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with <br>sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah of his entry into <br>Paradise; and whosoever does not guard his salaat, there is <br>no such guarantee for him; he may-or may not be forgiven. <br>salaat has indeed a tremendous value. It affords us an op- <br>portunity to 'receive Allah's guarantee for Paradise. When <br>an honourable person of some financial standing or having <br>executive power gives us a guarantee or stands surety for <br>meeting any of our requirements of this world, we feel <br>quite satisfied and happy and we consider it our duty to <br>remain obliged and devoted to him. Here Allah the Abso- <br>lute Sovereign of both the worlds, is giving the guarantee <br>and is standing surety for the real success after death in <br>return for five times daily salaat, which does not involve <br>much effort on our part. If even then we do not avail of the <br>opportunity, we shall have none to blame, but ourselves for <br>the dreadful doom that awaits us. <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Ibn Salmaan says that he heard one of the companions <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) nar- <br>rating, \"When we had won the battle of Khaibar, we <br>began to buy and sell among ourselves the booty that <br>had fallen to our lot. One of us went to Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, '0, Apostle of <br>Allah, no one else has earned so much profit as I have <br>obtained in today's trade.' 'How much did you earn? <br>asked the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He re- <br>plied, 'I kept on selling and buying till I earned a net <br>profit of three hundred 'Ooqiyyah' of silver.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I <br>inform you of something better than that?\" He ex-<br>claimed, 'Do tell me, 0,Prophet of Allah!' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked 'Two rakaats <br>nafl after (fardh) salaat.\" <br>Three hundred Ooqiyyahs of silver come to about three <br>thousand rupees. According to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), the perishable gain of this world stands <br>no comparison with the everlasting gain of the Hereafter. <br>Our life will be pleasant and worth living if we develop our <br>'Imaan' to an extent where two rakaats of salaat, in our <br>sight, are more valuable than all the riches of this world. <br>salaat is really a great treasure and that is why the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of <br>his eyes' and had been enjoining its observance right up to <br>his last breath. Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that the last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), which he could hardly utter, were about guard- <br>ing the salaat and kindness towards the slaves. There is a <br>similar hadith narrated by Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>as well. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once deputed <br>in Jihaad a Jamaat towards Najd. They returned victorious <br>very soon with a handsome booty. When the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saw the people envying them and <br>wondering at their quick and lucrative return, he said to <br>them, \"Shall I inform you of a group of people who earn <br>much more in a much shorter time? They are those who <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>perform their Fajr with Jamaat and keep sitting after prayer <br>till a little while after sunrise and then offer two rakaats of <br>salaat.\" According to Shaqeeq Balkhi, a very famous <br>Shaikh, five things could be acquired through five chan- <br>nels; an increase in provisions through 'Chaasht' a light in <br>the grave through Tahajjud, a very satisfactory answer to <br>Munkar and Nakeer through the recitation of the Qur'an; an <br>easy crossing of Siraat through fasting and alms, and room <br>under the shade of Allah's Throne on the Day of Judgement <br>through seclusion (i.e. Zikr). <br>There are so many sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) enjoining salaat and explaining its <br>virtues that it is very difficult to cover all of them in this <br>small book. A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in <br>the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in the matter of <br>salaat!. <br>3. \t \"SalCat intervenes between man and Shirk.\" <br>4.\t \"Salaat is the mark of Islam. A person who says <br>his salaat at the fixed hours with sincerity and de- <br>votion, observing all its regulations including the <br>Mustahabbaat, is surely a Mo'min.\" <br>5. \t \"Of all things that have been ordained by Allah, <br>Imaan and salaat are the most valued. If there were <br>any otber thing better than salaat, then Allah <br>would have ordained it for His Angels, some of <br>whom are always in ruku and others in sajdah.\" <br>6. \t \"Salaat is the pillar of Islam.\" <br>7. \t \"Salaat abases the Devil.\" <br>8. \t \"Salaat is the light of a Mo'min.\" <br>9. \"Salaat is the best Jihaad.\" <br>10. \t \"Allah keeps relenting towards a person so long as <br>he is engaged in salaat.\" <br>11. \"When a calamity befalls us from the heaven, <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>people frequenting the musjid are spared and <br>saved.\" <br>12. \t \"If some major sins of a Muslim land him in Hell, <br>the fire would not burn those parts of his body <br>which have touched the ground while he was in <br>sajdah during his salaat.\" <br>13. \t \"Fire has been forbidden to touch those parts of <br>the body which touch the ground while perform- <br>ing the sajdah.\" <br>% <br>14. \"Of all the practices, salaat made at fixed hours is 8 <br>5<br>most loved by Allah.\" \t<br>.-<br>L V ~<br>> <br>15. \"Allah likes most the posture of a person when he <br>is in sajdah, pressing his forehead on the ground <br>in humility.\" <br>16. \"A person in sajdah is nearest unto Allah.\" <br>17. \"Sa1aa.t is a key to Paradise.\" <br>18. \"When a person stands in salaat the gates of Par- <br>adise are let open and all the veils between him <br>and Allah are lifted (provided that he spoils not <br>his salaat by coughing etc).\" <br>19. \"A person in salaat (so to say) knocks at the door <br>of the sovereign Lord, and the door is always <br>opened for him who knocks.\" <br>20. \t \"The position of salaat in Islam is as the position <br>of the head in a body.\" <br>21. \t \"Salaat is the light of the heart. Let those who <br>wish enlighten their hearts (through salaat)\". <br>22. \"If \t a person wishes to have his sins forgiven by <br>Allah, he should perform the wudhu properly, <br>offer with devotion two or four rak'aats of fardh or <br>nafl and then pray to Allah. Allah will forgive <br>him.\" <br>23. \t \"Any strip of earth, on which Allah is remem-<br>bered in salaat, takes pride over the rest of the <br>Earth.\" <br>24. \"Allah accepts the prayer of a person who prays to <br>Him after performing two rakaats of salaat. Allah <br>grants him what he prays for, sometimes immedi- <br>ately and sometimes (in his own interest) later.\" <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>25. \t \"A person who performs two rakaats of salaat in <br>seclusion, where nobody except Allah and His <br>Angels see him, receives a writ of deliverance <br>from the fire of hell.\" <br>26. \t \"Grant of one prayer (wish) becomes due to a <br>person from Allah after each fardh salaat per-<br>formed by him.\" <br>27. \t \"Fire of Hell is forbidden and the Paradise be- <br>comes due to a person who performs his wudhu <br>properly and says his salaat conscientiously, <br>according to its regulations.\" \t<br>28. \t \"The Devil remains scared of a Muslim so long as <br>he is particular about his salaat, but no sooner <br>does he neglect it than the Devil gets a hold upon <br>him and aspires for success in seducing him.\" <br>29. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is the most excellent <br>practice.\" <br>30. \t \"Salaat is the offering of the pious.\" <br>31. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is a practice most liked <br>by Allah.\" \t<br>32. \t \"At dawn, some people go to the musjid and some <br>to the market.

Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the <br>comfort of his eyes and used to spend the major part of the <br>night standing before Allah. For the very same reason, our <br>dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even on his<br>death-bed charged us and enjoined on us to be particular <br>about salaat. It has been reported in many ahaadith that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often say, <br>\"Fear Allah concerning salaat.\" Abdullah bin Mas'ood, <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"Of all the practices, <br>salaat is the dearest to me.\" <br>One of the Sahabah narrates, \"One night I happened to <br>go to the musjid. I found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) in salaat. I felt an ardent desire to join him. I made <br>I <br>my intention and stood behind him; he was reciting 'Baqa- <br>rah' at that time. I thought that he would finish the qiraat <br>and go for ruku at the end of the hundredth verse, but he <br>did not do so. Then I thought he would perhaps go to ruku <br>after finishing two hundred verses, but he did not stop <br>even there. I was sure then that he would finish qiyaam <br>with the end of the soorah. When the soorah ended he <br>hymned, 'Allahumma Lakalhamd' (Allah! Thine is all <br>Glory) a number of times and then started 'Aal Imraan'. On <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak, the famous Soofi, writes, <br>\"My neighbour at Koofah had a son. The boy fasted during <br>the day and kept praying and hymning during the night. <br>This constant strain emaciated him so much that his body <br>was reduced to a skeleton. His father requested me to ad- <br>monish him. Once I was sitting at my door when the boy <br>passed by. He greeted me with 'Assalaamu alaikum' and sat <br>down. I had hardly said anything when he interrupted <br>saying, 'Dear Uncle! Maybe you intend to admonish me to <br>reduce my pursuits. Listen to my story first. I had a few <br>friends in the locality. We decided among ourselves to vie <br>with one another in worship and adoration of Allah. They <br>all applied themselves so hard that they were soon sent for <br>by Allah. They embraced death delightedly and peacefully. <br>Now I am the only one left behind. What will they think of <br>me when they know of my lagging behind? Dear Uncle! My <br>friends really strived very hard and achieved their goal,' He <br>then began to relate the pursuits and accomplishments of <br>his departed friends, which astonished all the listeners. <br>After this he left me. I heard a few days later that the boy <br>too had died (May Allah bless him).\" <br>Even in these days there are persons who remain en- <br>gaged in salaat for the major portion of the night and <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat <br>Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I love most <br>are: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and reciting the <br>Qur'an.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). \"And I love the three things most: serving a guest, <br>fasting on a very hot day and smiting the enemy with my <br>sword.\" At this, Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) appeared on the <br>scene and said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Allah has sent me to tell you what I would love if I be one <br>of the mortals.\" \"Yes, do tell us, Jibra-eel\", said the <br>Prophet. jibra-eel then replied, \"If I had been like you, I <br>would have loved three things: guiding the people gone <br>astray, loving those who worship in poverty and helping <br>the poor family men. And as for Allah, He loves three <br>I \t<br>characteristics of His slaves: striving in His Path, crying at <br>the time of repentance, and steadfastness in want and <br>hunger.\" <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim writes: 'Salaat ensures daily bread, <br>promotes health, drives out diseases, strengthens the heart, <br>brings light and beauty on the face, pleases the soul, re- <br>freshes the body, cures indolence, relieves the mind, feeds <br>the soul, illumines the heart and guarantees Allah's favour. <br>It grants protection against Allah's Doom. It keeps the Devil <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>WARNING AND REPROACH FOR NEGLECTING <br>SALAAT <br>The books on hadith mention very severe punishment <br>for those who neglect salaat. From many traditions on the <br>s,ubject, only a few are reproduced in this chapter. <br>Although a single warning from the most truthful Prophet <br>3E j,<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was enough, yet we find that, grn<br>out of love and mercy for his followers, he has cautioned <br>them again and again and in various manners lest they <br>should neglect salaat and suffer the consequences. In spite <br>of all this, alas! we are unmindful of salaat, and still we <br>have the audacity to consider ourselves devotees of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and champions of <br>Islam. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>1. \t \"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr and <br>Shirk.\" <br>3. \t \"Discarding of salaat is the only partition between <br>Imaan and Kufr.\" <br>There are a number of ahaadith on the subject. On one <br>occasion, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said: \"Hurry up with your salaat when it <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us! <br>Hadhrat IJbaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates. 'My. dear friend the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) while enjoining upon me seven good prac- <br>tices said, \"Do not ascribe anything as partner to Allah, <br>though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not forego salaat intentionally, lest you <br>should get out of the fold of Islam; do not perpetrate <br>disobedience of Allah, lest you deserve His wrath; and <br>do not take to drinking, for that is the mother of all <br>evils'.\" <br>In another hadith, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"My dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>warned me saying, 'Do not ascribe anything as partner unto <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar-<br>rates: \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined upon me ten things, viz, 'Do not ascribe <br>anything as partner unto Allah, though you may be <br>slain or burnt alive; do not disobey your parents. <br>though you may have to part with your wife or your <br>entire wealth; do not neglect fardh salaat, intention- <br>ally, for Allah is free from obligation to a person who <br>neglects fardh salaat intentionally; do not take wine, <br>for it is an evil habit; that is the root of every uice; do <br>not commit disobedience of Allah, for that brings the <br>wrath of Allah. Do not turn your back to the enemy in <br>battle, though all your comrades may have fallen. Do <br>not fly from the locality where an epidemic has broken <br>out. Do spend on your family members according to <br>your capacity; let your rod be hanging on them, as a <br>warning and to chastise against neglect of their duties <br>towards Allah.\" <br>According to this hadith, we should not spare the roci <br>in checking the children from becoming reckless ih doing <br>anything they like. Sometimes it is necessary to use the <br>rod. It is a pity that out of love we do not use the rod in the <br>beginning and, when the children get spoilt, we cry and <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\" <br>Hadhrat Naufil bin Mu'aawiyah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"A person who has missed one <br>salaat is like one who has lost all his family and <br>wealth.\" <br>Salaat is missed usually when either a person is in the <br>company of his family members or is in pursuit of money. <br>According to this hadith, the ultimate loss sustained in <br>missing a salaat is in no way less than the loss of the whole <br>family and property. In other words, if we miss a salaat we <br>should be as much grieved as when we lose all of our folk <br>and entire belongings. If we are cautioned by some reliable <br>person about the presence of gangsters on a certain road, <br>where people are robbed and killed during the night, we <br>need a lion's heart to ignore the caution and travel on that <br>road even during the day time. Strange enough to note that <br><br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>themselves as practical Muslims perform a number of their <br>salaats in combination on returning home, on the very <br>feeble excuses of travel, trade or occupation. To put salaat <br>off till after its set time without a strong excuse (illness, <br>etc) is a major sin. Although it is not so disastrous as neg- <br>lecting salaat, yet it is quite serious. <br>Hadith VI <br>Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while <br>talking about salaat said: \"For its votary, salaat \"shall on <br>the Day of Judgement, be a light for him, an argument <br>in his favour, and a means of his deliverance. Whereas <br>there will be no light, no defence and no deliverance <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from doom for him who does not guard his salaat, and <br>he shall meet the fate of Pharoah, Haamaan and Ubbay <br>bin Khalaf.\" <br>Everybody knows that Pharoah-the big disbeliever-- <br>had been so arrogant that he proclaimed himself 'Lord the <br>Highest' and made his people worship him. Haamaan was <br>his Chief Minister and accomplice. Ubbay bin Khalaf was <br>the most active and severest enemy of Islam among the dis- <br>believers of Mecaa. Before the Hijrah, he used to announce <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) most insolently, <br>\"I have reared a horse, which I feed very well; I will slay <br>you one day riding on its back.\" Once the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied to him, \"Inshaa-allaah! you <br>shall meet your end at my hands.\" In the battle of Uhud, he <br>ran about in the field in search of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is not slain today, then I stand no chance of sur- <br>viving.\" He at last found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and advanced to attack him. The Companions <br>decided to finish him before he reached the Prophet, but <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stopped them. <br>When he came near, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) took a spear from one of the companions and struck <br>him with it, causing a little scratch on his neck. He stag- <br>gered and fell down from his horse and then fled towards <br>his camp crying, \"By Allah, Mtlkammad (SaHallaho alaihe <br>wasalhm) has killed me!\" His people tried to cansole him <br>and told him that it was only a bruise and there was noth- <br>ing to worry h u t ,  but he would say, \"Muhammad (~allal- <br>laho alaihe wasellam) had once announced to me in Mecca <br>that he would kill me. By Allah, had he only spat at me, I <br>would be no more.\" It is said that he cried like a bull. Abu <br>Sufyan, who was very active on that day, put him to shame <br>for crying in that manner over a slight wound, but he said, <br>\"Do you know who has inflicted this injury upon me? It <br>was none other than Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). By Laat and Uzza! if my agony be distributed over all <br>the people of Hijaaz, none of them would survive. Since <br>the time he had declared that he would kill me, I was sure <br>that I would meet my death at his hands. If he only spat at <br>me after that declaration, I would be no more.\" So he died <br>on his way hack, at a day's journey from Mecca. <br>Look! a disbeliever like Ubbay bin Khalaf is so sure <br>about the truth of the Prophet's words that he does not <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of <br>punishment, who knows, may last for thousands of years. <br>Hadith VII <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favours on <br>a person who is mindful of his salaat, viz: His daily bread <br>is made easy for him; he is saved from the punishments in <br>the grave; he shall receive his record in his right hand on <br>the Day of Judgement; he shall cross the Siraat with the <br>speed of lightning and he shall enter Paradise without reck- <br>oning. As for him who neglects his salaat, he shall meet <br>five types of punishments in this world, three at the time of <br>death, three in the grave and three after resurrection. <br>Those in this world are: he is not blessed in life; he is <br>deprived of the light with which the faces of the righteous <br>are endowed; he receives no rewards for his good practices; <br>his prayers are not answered; and he has no share in the <br>prayers of the pious. Those at the time of death are: he dies <br>disgracefully; he dies hungry; he dies in thirst; which the <br>water in the oceans of the world cannot quench. <br>Those in the grave are: He is so squeezed there that the <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other side; fire <br>is burnt inside for him and he is rolled on cinders day and <br>night; a serpent with fiery eyes and iron nails equal in <br>length to a day's journey is let loose on him and shouts <br>with a thundering voice, 'My Lord has charged me with <br>thrashing you till sunrise for neglecting Fajr, till Asr for <br>neglecting Zuhur, till sunset for neglecting Asr, till Ishaa <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in <br>mind that even after the declaration of a person as being <br>guilty, Allah is free to pardon him as and when he pleases. <br>He says in His Holy Book: <br>\"Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be as- <br>cribed unto Him. Allah pardoneth all (save that) whom <br>He will. <br>(IV: 116)\" <br>If then it pleases Allah to pardon anybody neglecting <br>salaat, it will be most fortunate; but who can be sure of this <br>fortune? <br>It is also stated in hadith that there will be three courts <br>to be held by Allah on the Day of Judgement. The first will <br>judge between kufr and islaam and there will be no pardon. <br>The second will be to judge the duties and conduct of one <br>towards another. All aggrieved shall be compensated there; <br>compensation will either be realised from the aggressor or <br>paid by Allah Himself, if He pleases to pardon anybody. <br>The third will deal with duties towards Allah. Here the <br>doors of Allah's mercy will be thrown wide-open and He <br>shall pardon anybody He wills. In the light of all that has <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>to have seen (in his dream) a group of people being treated <br>likewise. Jiba-eel (Alayhis salaam) informed him on his <br>query that thpse were the persons who used to neglect their <br>salaat. <br>Mujahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"Allah blesses the <br>people who guard their salaat, just as he blessed Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) and his descendants.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If a <br>person dies with sincere Imaan, observing the command- <br>ments of Allah, performing salaat, and paying Zakaat, <br>when he dies Allah is pleased with him.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Allah says, 'I hold back retribution, deserved by a locality, <br>when I see therein some people who frequently visit the <br>musjid, love one another for My sake, and pray for forgive- <br>ness in the hours of darkness.\" <br>Hadhmt Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) wrote to <br>Hadhrat Salmaan: \"Spend most of your time in the musiid. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"The musjid is the abode of the pious. Allah has <br>taken upon Himself to bless the person who spends most of <br>I <br>I<br>I <br>I <br>I <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand- <br>ing at a distance.\" <br>One of the companions reports that, when the inmates <br>of the Prophet's house were hard-pressed in any way, he <br>would enjoin salaat on them and recite the following verse: <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision, We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for the righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that she heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"All the <br>people will be gathered together on the Day of Judgement <br>and they will all hear the voice of the announcing angel. <br>He will say, 'where are those who glorified Allah in ease <br>and adversity?' A group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. It will then be announced, 'where are <br>those who forsook their beds and spent their nights in <br>worship?' Another group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. The angel will again announce, 'where <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The <br>reckoning will then commence after these three groups <br>have been eliminated.\" <br>It is said that during the early times people could see <br>Satan. A person approached him saying how could he be <br>like him. Satan told him that had he never received such a <br>request before and asked hin? what had prornpted him to <br>ask for it. The person told him that he wished it from his <br>heart. Satan told him to neglect his salaat and to swear very <br>frequently, not caring whether he was doir~g it truthfully. <br>The person told Satan that he would swear by Allah never <br>to give up salaat and swear falsely. Satan told him that <br>never before he had been tricked by a human being to seek <br>his advice. He was determined never to do so in future. <br>Xadhrat Ubayv (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Give glad tidings to the Muslims that they shall be hon- <br>oured and exalted, and their religion shall prevail, but <br>there is no portion in the Hereafter for those who exploit <br>Islam for wordlv gains.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"I saw Allah in His best form. He said to me, '0 <br>'Muhammad! what are the Highest Chiefs (Angels) arguing <br>about'?' I said, 'I have no knowledge about that.' Allah <br>i<br>I <br>, <br>l <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the <br>questioning of Angels, is a shade against the Sun on the <br>Day of Judgement, is a protection against the fire of Hell, is <br>a weight for the scales of good deeds, is a means of swift <br>crossing over the Siraat arid is a key to Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthmarl (Radhiyallaho anho) is reported to <br>have said. \"Allah bestows nine fdvours on a person who <br>guards his salaat and is particular in performing it at its ap- <br>pointed hours: viz; He is loved by Allah, he enjoys good <br>health, is constantly under the protection of angels, his <br>home is blessed, the light of righteousrless shines on his <br>face, his heart is made soft, he shall cross the Siraat with <br>the speed of lightning, he is saved from Hell, and his neigh- <br>bours in Paradise are those about whom Allah has said. <br>'There shall be no fear come upon them, neither shall <br>they grieve (11: 36). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Salaat <br>is the Pillar of Islam and it has ten virtues, viz: It is a charm <br>of the face, a light of the heart, health and refreshment for <br>the bodv, a companv in the grave, a means for the descent <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and <br>one who neglects Zuhr as '0 you loser', and one who ig- <br>nores Asr as '0 you transgressor', and one who omits <br>Maghrib as '0 you kaafir', and one who does not say Ishaa <br>as '0you violator of Allah's commandments.\" <br>Alama Sha'raani (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"It should <br>be clearly understood that a calamity is drawn off from a <br>locality the people of which are particular about salaat, <br>whereas a locality the people of which neglect salaat is fre- <br>quently visited by calamities. Earthquakes, thunderbolts <br>and sinking of houses are not unexpected where people are <br>not particular about salaat. Simply guarding one's own <br>salaat is not enough, because when a calamity strikes, it <br>does not befall the wrongdoers alone. It affects everybody <br>in that locality. Once the Sahabah asked the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Can we perish while there are <br>pious people among us?\" the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) replied, \"Yes, if vice becomes predominant.\" It <br>is therefore necessary that other people should also be en- <br>joined to stick to Allah's commandments and refrain from <br>wrongdoing. <br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0 <br>Allah! cause not any one of us to be a wretched destitute.'? <br>He then said: \"Do you know who is a wretched destitute?\" <br>At the'request of the companions, he explained to them <br>saying, \"A wretched destitute is he who neglects his salaat. <br>In Islaam there is nothing for him.\" In another hadith it is <br>said, \"Allah will not care a bit for the person who has been <br>neglecting salaat intentionally, and for him shall be an <br>awful doom.\" <br>It is reported in a hadith that ten persons will be <br>specially tormented, and one of them will be the person <br>who neglects his salaat. It is said that his hands will be tied <br>while the angels shall smite him on his face and back. Par- <br>adise will tell him, 'In me there is no room for you,' and <br>Hell will sav to him, 'Come to me. You are for me and I am <br>for you.' It is also reported that there is a valley in Hell <br>named Lamlam. This vallev is infested with serpents as fat <br>as the neck of a camel and as long as one month's journey. <br>A person neglecting salaat shall be tormented in this <br>valley. 111 another hadith, it is reported that there is a vale <br>in the Hell. which is krlown as the Pit of Grief; it is infested <br>with scorpions of the size of a mule. This place is also <br>meant for tormenting the people who neglect salaat. Of <br>course, there is nothing to worry if the most merciful Allah <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"There is no place in Islaam for a person who <br>does .not say his salaat, and there is no salaat without <br>wudhu.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) also heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying. \"There is no Islaam in a person when <br>there is no salaat by him. The position of salaat in <br>Islaam is as the position of the head in a body.\" <br>Let those who do not offer salaat, and not onlv call <br>themselves Muslims, but also boast of their being cham- <br>pions of the Muslim cause, ponder over these words of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They dream of <br>reviving the past glory of Islaam. but would not care to <br>know how rigidly the people responsible for that glory <br>stuck to the practices of Islaam. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhivallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eve. People told him that the dis- <br>ease could be treated, but he would have to miss his salaat <br>for a few days. He said: \"This is not possible; I have heard <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer- <br>tain man and said, \"Take this one; he is particular about <br>his salaat. But you are not to beat him. We are forbidden to <br>beat one who says salaat.\" We, on the other hand, mock at <br>our servant and consider him a liability if he goes for <br>salaat. <br>Sufyaan 'rhauri (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous Soofi <br>once fell into a state of ecstasy. He remained in his house <br>for seven days without sleep, food and drink. When his <br>Shaikh was informed of his condition, he inquired if Su- <br>fyaan was observing the hours of his salaat. He was told <br>that his salaat was quite regular and safe. At this, the <br>Shaikh remarked, \"Glory be to Allah, Who has not allowed <br>the Devil to have an upper hand on him! \" <br><br>PART I1 <br>IMPORTANCE OF JAMAAT <br>As has already been said in tne foreword, there are many <br>who say their salaat regularly but are not very particular <br>about Jamaat. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>as emphatic in enjoining Jamaat as he is particular about <br>salaat. This part also consists of two chapters. The first <br>deals with the rewards of Jamaat and the second with the <br>consequences of its neglect. <br>CHAPTER I <br>REWARDS OF JAMAAT <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) saying: \"A salaat with Jamaat is twenty-seven <br>times superior to salaat performed individually.\" <br>When we offer our salaat for getting reward from <br>Allah, then why should it not be done in the musjid, where <br>the reward earned is twenty-seven times more. Nobody <br>will be so unwise as to forego a profit twenty-seven times <br>greater with simply a little extra labour. But we are so in- <br>different about the profits promised for our religious prac- <br>tices! This can be due to nothing but our disregard for deen <br>and the rewards of it. It is a pity that we apply ourselves so <br>hard to acquiring the trifling gains in this material world; <br>but are so unmindful of the gains in the Hereafter, which <br>yield twenty-seven times more with a little extra effort. We <br>often argue that for going to the musjid for Jamaat we have <br>to close the shop and will thus lose business. These pre- <br>texts and others of the kind cannot stand in the way of <br>those who have perfect faith in the Greatness of Allah, and <br><br>Part I1 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>28 <br>in His word; and who realize the value of the blessings and <br>reward in the Hereafter. It is in respect of such people that <br>Allah says: <br>\"Men, whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>then from remembrance of Allah and constancy in <br>salaat.\" <br>(XXIV;37). <br>It is said of Saalim Haddaad (Rahmatullah alaih] (a .-,-<br>trader and a great Soofi) that on hearing Azaan he would <br>g 2<br>turn pale and grow restless. He would stand up immedi- .Ez<br>ately, leaving his shop open and recite these couplets:- <br>><br>1. \"When Thy summoner stands up to summon, <br>quickly I stand up. <br>To respond to (the summons of) The Mighty Lord <br>Who hath no peer.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"I reply to the summons with complete submis- <br>sion and cheer, 'Here am I, 0 Bountiful One.\" <br>3. \t<br>\"My face grows pale with awe and fear, and occu- <br>pation in Thee distracts me from all other occupa- <br>tions.\" <br>4. <br>\"I swear by Thee, naught is dear to me save Thy <br>remembrance. <br>Nothing is more ravishing for me than Thy sweet <br>name.\" <br>5. \t \"0,will th'ere be a time for us to be together? <br>A lover is happy only when he is with his love.\" <br>6. \"He whose eyes have seen the light of Thy Beauty <br>Can never be solaced. He must die yearning for <br>Thee.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"People frequenting the musjid <br>are its pegs (dwellers). Angels are their companioris and <br>visit them when they are sick and help them when they are <br>at their jobs.\" <br>Hadith I1 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\" <br>In Hadith No. I, the superiority of salaat with Jamaat <br>over that offered individually is described as being twenty- <br>seven times more, while this hadith mentions only twenty- <br>five times. Various theologians have discussed at length <br>this seeming inconsistency. The following are some of the <br>explanations: <br>1. \t \"This variation from twenty-five to twenty-seven <br>is due to variation of ikhlaas (sincerity) in differ- <br>ent individuals.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"In Sirri (quiet) salaat (i.e., Zuhr and Asr), it is <br>twenty-five times, while in Jahri (loud) salaat (i.e., <br>Fajr, Maghrib and Ishaa), it is twenty-seven <br>times.\" <br>3. \t \"In Fajr and Ishaa, when it is somewhat incon- <br>venient to go out due to cold and darkness, it is <br>twenty-seven times, but in other salaats it is <br>twenty-five times.\" <br>4. \t \"In the beginning it was twenty-five times, but <br>subsequently Allah (by special favour on the fol- <br>lowers of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>raised the reward to twenty-seven times.\" <br>1 <br>I <br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the <br>ihraam (Hajj apparel) at his house, leaves for Hajj\". <br>Further, in the same hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) points to another act of great value; i.e., as <br>long as one remains sitting in musjid after the salaat is <br>over, the angels pray for him asking for forgiveness and <br>mercy. The angels are the innocent and holy creation of <br>Allah. So, the effectiveness of their prayers is self-evident. <br>Muhammad bin Samaak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous theologian and Sheikh. He died at the age of one <br>hundred and three. He used to perform two hundred <br>rakaats of nafl salaat daily. He writes: \"For forty years, I <br>never _missed the first takbeer of salaat with Jamaat, except <br>once when my mother had died.\" The same Shaikh writes: <br>\"Once I missed the Jamaat. As I knew that salaat with <br>Jamaat was twenty-five times superior, I repeated this <br>salaat (individually) twenty-five times to make up the loss. <br>I heard in my dream some one saying to me, 'Muhammad! <br>You have repeated your salaat 25 times (in the hope of <br>making good the loss), but what about the 'Aameen' by the <br>Angels?\" It is reported in many ahaadith that when the <br>Imaam says 'Aameen' after Fatihah, the Angels also say <br>Aameen and all the past sins of a person whose Ameen <br>coincides with that of the Angels are forgiven. This is <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: \"If one wishes to meet Allah on the Day of Judge- <br>ment as a Muslim, he must say his salaat at a place <br>where Azaan is called out, viz., a musjid, as Allah has <br>prescribed through His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) such practices which are nothing but guid- <br>ance through and through: and salaat (with Jamaat) is <br>one of them. If you start saying your salaat at your <br>houses (as.so and so is doing), then vou will be dis-<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) led the salaat at his instance, and <br>he himself joined the Jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to him, <br>\"Worship your Lord as if you see Him before you, count <br>yourself among the dead, beware of the curse of the <br>wronged ones and, even if you could crawl to the musjid, <br>do not miss Ishaa and Fajr with Jamaat.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"Ishaa and Fajr are very <br>heavy on those who are munaafiq. If they knew the reward <br>of the Jamaat, they would go to the musjid and join the <br>Jamaat even if they had to crawl.\" <br>Hadith IV <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Maalik (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>saying, \"A person who in all sincerity is constant in <br>his salaat with Jamaat for forty days, without missing <br>the first takbeer, recieves two awards: one for deliv- <br>erance from Hell and the ~ t h e r  for freedom from <br>nifaaq.\" <br>If a person is regular in his salaat (with sincerity) for <br>forty days and joins the Jamaat from the very start (i.e., <br>when the Imaam calls out his first takbeer), then he shan <br>neither be a munaafiq nor shall he go to Hell. A munaafiq <br>is a person who feigns being a Muslim, but there is kufr in <br>his heart., Genesis of man (according to hadith) takes place <br>in periods of forty days. This seems to be the significance <br>of forty days in this hadith, and so the Soofis attach import- <br>ance to this period (called Chillah in Urdu) for purposes of <br>spiritual discipline. <br>Lucky indeed are the persons who do not miss their <br>first takbeer for years together. <br>Hadith V <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who performs wudhu scrupulously, <br>and then goes to the musjid and finds that Jamaat is <br>over, receives a reword equal to that of Jamaat. This <br>would not diminish anything from the reward of those <br>who have actually performed their salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>This is indeed Allah's great favour and beneficence <br>that the mere effort and a slight exertion is enough to en- <br>title us to a reward of Jamaat, though actually we fail to <br>join it. Who is the loser then if we ourselves get left, and <br>miss the bounties of the most Bountiful? <br>This hadith also shows that we-should not postpone <br>going to the musjid in apprehension of the Jamaat being <br>over. Even if we find on reaching the musjid that Jamaat is <br>over, we will still get the reward thereof. If, however, we <br>are certain that the Jamaat is already over, then there is of <br>course no idea in going to the musjid for Jamaat. <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not <br>correct, as in the first place they are deprived of the reward <br>of saying salaat in the musjid and secondly, they lose the <br>blessing of salaat with a big Jamaat. The bigger the congre- <br>gation, the more pleasing it is to Allah. When our sole dim <br>is to achieve the pleasure of Allah, why should we not <br>adopt a manner more pleasing to Him. It is reported in a <br>hadith that Allah is pleased to see three things, namely, a <br>row of worshippers offering salaat with Jamaat, a persor, <br>busy in salaat at the time of Tahajjud at the dead of night, <br>and a person fighting in the way of Allah.\" <br>Hadith VII <br>Hadhrat Sahl bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Give glad tidings to those who go to the <br>musjid frequently during hours of darkness, for they <br>will have perfect light on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the <br>Qur'an' <br>\"He only shall tend Allah's musjid who believes in <br>Allah and the L,ast Day.\" <br>(IV:18).\" <br>The following are a few more ahaadith about the vir- <br>tues of salaat with Jamaat:- <br>1. \t \"Making wudhu when inconvenient, walking to- <br>wards 'the musjid and sitting there (after one <br>salaat), waiting for the next salaat, wipe out the <br>sins.\" <br>2. \t \"The farther a person lives from the 'musjid' the <br>greater the hlessing he receives.\" This is so be- <br>cause a person coming from a distance shall have <br>to walk more and, as already mentioned, every <br>step will fetch him a blessing. For this very reason <br>some companions have been reported to be taking <br>short steps in going to the musjid in order to earn <br>more blessings. <br>3. \t<br>\"There are three things in this world for which <br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>explain the importance of salaat with Jamaat, but their <br>explanations vary with the extent of their understanding <br>and their power to probe into Divine secrets. Our respected <br>Shaikh, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (may Allah illumine his <br>grave), in his famous Book 'Hujjatullahil Balighah' <br>writes:-<br>\"To save the people from the fatal effects that their <br>own customs and rituals can bring them, there is nothing <br>more useful than to make one of the religious services so <br>common a custom and so public a ritual that it may be per- <br>formed openly before everybody by any person, whether he <br>be learned or illiterate. The town-folk and the countrymen <br>should both be equally anxious to observe it. It should <br>become a subject of rivalry and pride among all of them, <br>and ~t should be so universally practised that it becomes <br>part and parcel of their social set-up, so much so, that life <br>without it may be worthless for them. If this is achieved, it <br>will help in establishing the worship and obedience of <br>Allah and will form a very useful substitute for those <br>rituals and customs which could cause them serious harm. <br>Since salaat is the only religious observance that surpasses <br>all others in importance and universality, both in reason <br>and authority, it becomes therefore absolutely necessary to <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>hearts and souls turned to Him alone, have the wonderful <br>effect of causing His blessings and Mercy to descend from <br>Heaven. <br>\"Moreover, the Muslim community has been raised so <br>that the word of Allah be held supreme and Islamic Order <br>be paramount over all others. This object cannot be <br>achieved unless all Muslims, big and small, the elite and <br>the common, the town folk and the countrymen, perform <br>alike the most sublime service and the most sacred ritual of <br>Islam (i.e., salaat) by assembling together in one place. It is <br>for this reason that the Sharee-at (Islamic Law) lays such <br>special stress on Friday congregation and on salaat with <br>jamaat, by explaining the blessings that accrue therefrom <br>and punishments awarded for neglect 1 lereof. For the open <br>and conspicuous observance of this im?ortant service, two <br>types of assemblies are required: one fr~rpeople of a clan or <br>a particular locality and the other for the people of the <br>whole town. Since the assembly or\" the former at any hour <br>is convenient and that of the latte, comparatively difficult, <br>so for the former, the gathering for salaat (with jamaat) five <br>times daily, has been laid down and in the case of the latter <br>gathering, the weekly Friday salaat has been devised and <br>ordained.\" <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>REPROACH ON GIVING UP JAMAAT <br>Just as Allah has promised rewards and blessings for <br>adhering to His commandments, so has He warned us of <br>the woeful consequences and punishments for their neg- <br>lect. We are in bondage to Allah and as such it is obligatory <br>on us to obey Him. No compensation or reward is due to us <br>for our obedience to Him. If He gives a reward, it is surely a <br>matter of His extreme favour on us. Similarly no punish- <br>ments can be too much for us if we disobey Him-our Lord, <br>for their can be no greater crime for a bondsman than to <br>disobey his Master. Hence no warning or premonition was <br>required to be imparted. Yet Allah and His Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) have so very kindly cautioned <br>us in various ways, warned us frequently of the conse-<br>quences and explained to us again and again, just to save <br>us from disaster. If even then, we don't take a lesson, who <br>collld there be to save us from the inevitable consequences? <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"I <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"If a person in spite of hearing the azaan does not go to <br>the musjid (and he prefers to say his salaat at home) <br>without a strong excuse, then his salaat is not ac-<br>cepted. When the Companions inquired as to what <br>could be a strong excuse, he replied, \"Illness or fear.\" <br>It may perhaps appear from this Hadith that the salaat <br>performed at home (after hearing the Azaan) is no salaat at <br>all; the Hanafiyyah do not hold this view. According to <br>them, though the reward and blessings promised for fardh <br>salaat will not be awarded, yet the person saying the salaat <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus- <br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those <br>places (mosques) where the Azaan is said: \"On the day <br>when the glory of Saaq is revealed and they are or- <br>dered to prostrate themselves, but are not able, with <br>eyes downcast, abasement stupifying them. And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br>Virtues of Sajaat <br>2. \t<br>These shall be infidels who did not say salaat at all. <br>3. \t These shall be the munaafiqeen. (Allah knows best and <br>His knowledge is most perfect). <br>What a terrible thing to be so abased and disgraced on <br>the Day of Judgement that, while all Muslims shall fall <br>prostrate at seeing Allah's glory, those who neglected salaat <br>with jamaat shall be singled out by their inability to do so. <br>Besides these, many other warnings have been given <br>against the neglect of jamaat. But as a matter of fact, none is <br>necessary for a good Muslim to whom the word of Allah <br>and His Apostle (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is all import- <br>ant. And for one who has no regard for their word, all such <br>warnings are meaningless. But a time will come when <br>every soul shall be called to account, and punished for its <br>misdeeds, and then no amount of penitence shall be of any <br>avail. <br><br>PART111 <br>IMPORTANCE OF SINCERITY AND DEVOTION IN <br>SALAAT <br>There are many persons who offer their salaat and <br>quite a lot of them are particular about jamaat as well, but <br>they say it so imperfectly that, instead of earning blessings <br>and reward for them, it is rejected forthwith. This, how- <br>ever, is not so bad as to discard salaat altogether, which as <br>we have already learnt, is very serious. Although we are <br>deprived of the rewards by saying a defective salaat, which <br>is not accepted, yet we are saved from the insolence of neg- <br>lecting and disobeying Allah's commandments. However, <br>when we spend our time, leave our work and undergo in- <br>convenience, then why should we not see that we get the <br>best return for our time and labour by saying our salaat as <br>best as we can? <br>This third part is divided into three chapters. In the <br>first chapter, a few quotations from the Holy Qur'an about <br>the people who are condemned for their bad salaat and <br>those who are praised for their good salaat, are given. In the <br>second Chapter, stories about the salaat of a few lovers of <br>Allah are collected. The third chapter consists of the say- <br>ings of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on this <br>subject. <br>CHAPTER I <br>QUOTATIONS FROM THE QUR'AN <br>\"Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah, but devo- <br>tion from you reacheth to Him.\" <br>(XXII:37) <br>Although this particular verse refers to the animal sac- <br>rifice, yet in principle it equally applies to all other rituals. <br>It is sincerity and devotion in a service by which its accept- <br>ance would be judged by Allah. Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice. He replied, 'Be sincere in all your <br>services, as sincerity will magnify the value of an action, <br>however insignificant it may be.\" <br>Hadhrat Thaubaan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Blessed be the sincere ones, for they are the lamps of <br>guidance. They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>ent interpretations: <br>1. To be so careless as to miss the correct time of salaat. <br>2. <br>To be inattentive in salaat. <br>3. To forget the number of rakaats. <br>\"When they (the hypocrites) stand up for salaat, they <br>perform it without earnestness and want but to be seen <br>by men and are mindful of Allah but little.\" <br>(IV: 142) <br>\"Now there hath succeeded them (Prophets) a later <br>generation who have ruined salaat and have followed <br>lusts. So they will meet Ghayy.\" <br>(XIX:59) <br>69 <br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after. According to many commentators, Ghayy is a pit in <br>Hell full of blood and pus. The persons who had ruined <br>their salaat shall be thrown into this pit. <br>Quotation- V<br>I <br>\"And naught preventeth that their (the hypocrites) <br>contributions should be accepted from them, save that <br>they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Apostle, and <br>they come not to worship, save as idlers, and pay3 not <br>i <br>(their contribution) save reluctantly.\" <br>(IV:54) <br>Note: The quotations I to V above relate to those who ruin <br>salaat. On the other hand, the following speak of <br>those whom Allah praises for their good salaat. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>\"Successful indeed are the believers who are humble <br>in their salaat. And who shun vain conversation. And <br>I \t<br>who are payers of the Zakaat. And who abstain from <br>sex, save from their wives or the slaves that their right <br>hand possess, for then they are not blameworthy but <br>who craveth beyond that, such are transgressors-And <br>who faithfully observe their pledges and their cove- <br>nants. And who pav heed to their salaat. These are the <br>heirs who will inherit Firdaus (Paradise). There they <br>will abide.\" <br>(XXIII:1to 11) <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Fir- <br>daus is the apex and the best portion of Paradise, where- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from all its rivers originate. Allah's throne will be placed <br>there. When you pray for Paradise, always pray for Fir- <br>daus.\" <br>\"And truly it (salaat) is hard save for the humble- <br>minded; who know that they have to meet their Lord, <br>and that unto Him they are returning.\" <br>(11: 45-46) <br>Quotation- VIII <br>\"In houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted, <br>and His name shall be remembered therein, do offer <br>praise to Him at morning and evening, men whom <br>neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remem- <br>berance of Allah and establishment of salaat and <br>paying Zakaat, who fear that Day when the hearts and <br>the eyeballs will be overturned so that Allah may <br>reward them for the best of what they did and increase <br>reward for them out of His bounty. Allah giveth bles- <br>sings without measure to whom He will.\" (XXIV: 36 to 38) <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says <br>\"Establishment of salaat means performance of ruku and <br>sajdah properly and constant concentration in salaat with <br>complete humility and submission.\" Hadhrat Qataadah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Wherever the words 'Establish- <br>ment of salaat' occur in Qur'ar,, they mean to guard its <br>hours, to perform wudhu in the right manner and to ob- <br>serve ruku and saidah properlv.\" <br><br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>I <br>I <br>\"The (faithful) slaves of Rahmaan (the Beneficent) are <br>they who walk upon the earth modestly and when the <br>foolish ever address them, they answer: Peace; and <br>who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and <br>standing.\" <br>(XXV: 63 -64) <br>After describing a few more qualities of His faithful <br>slaves, Allah says in the same context: <br>2 <br>\"They will be awarded the high place for as much as <br>they were steadfast, and they will meet therein with <br>welcome and the word of peace. Abiding there for <br>ever. Happy is it as abode and station.\" <br>(XXV: 75-76) <br>\"The believers in our revelations are those who forsake <br>their beds, to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and <br>spend of what We have bestowed on them.

But only men of <br>understanding will pay heed.\" <br>(XXXIX:9) <br>And angels would be entering through every door pro- <br>claiming: \"Peace be upon you, as a reward for your <br>perseverance on religious practices.\" Thus how splen- <br>did would be their end! <br>(XIII: 22-23). <br>\"Lo! man was created very impatient. Fretful when <br>evil befalleth him. And niggardly when good befalleth <br>him, save the worshippers who are constant at their <br>salaat.\" <br>(LXX: 19-23) <br>After giving some more qualities of these blessed <br>people, Allah says in the same context, <br>II <br>~ <br>I <br>I<br>I<br>Part 111 [a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>\"And those who guard their salaat. These will dwell in <br>gardens, honoured.\" <br>(LXX:34-35). <br>Besides the quotations given above, there are many <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an enjoining salaat and exalting and <br>extolling those who say their salaat properly. Salaat is <br>indeed a great boon. That is why Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of my eyes', and <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) prayed to Allah, <br>\"My Lord! make me to establish Salaat, and some of <br>my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept the prayer.\" <br>(XIV:40) <br>Here the eminent Prophet of Allah, whom Allah has <br>called 'Khaleel', is asking Allah to make him say his salaat <br>properly and regularly. The Glorious Allah Himself is or- <br>dering His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>thus:-<br>\"And enjoin salaat upon the people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision. We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>It is said in a hadith that whenever the housefolk of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were hard-pressed in <br>any way, he enjoined salaat on them and used to recite this <br>verse. All the Prophets of Allah (peace be upon them) are <br>reported to have engaged themselves in salaat whenever <br>they had any difficulty. But, alas! we are so unmindful and <br>indifferent about salaat that, in spite of all that we proclaim <br>about Islaam and Islamic practices, we pay no attention to <br>it. But on the contrary, if anybody stands up to invite us <br>and to draw our attention towards it, we cut jokes and <br>sneer at him and oppose him, thereby harming none else <br>but ourselves. <br>Even those who offer the salaat, often perform it in <br>such a way that it will not be wrong to call it a mockery of <br>salaat, as it lacks the proper observation of its requisites <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>and also the devotion and submission obligatory therein. <br>The practical example of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), as also the practices of his illustrious <br>companions, should be the guiding factor in our lives. I <br>have collected the stories about the salaat of the compan- <br>ions in a separate book, named \"Stories of Sahabah,\" and I <br>need not repeat them here. However, I am giving stories <br>from the lives of a few pious persons in the following <br>pages. The practices and the sayings of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) about this subject would <br>appear in Chapter 111. <br><br>i <br>I <br>CHAPTER I1 <br>A FEW STORIES FROM THE LIVES OF THE PIOUS <br>Shaikh Abdul Waahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One <br>LI <br>day I was so much overpowered by sleep that I went to bed <br>g <br>before finishing my Zikr for the night. I saw in my dream a 3* <br>most beautiful girl dressed in green silk. All parts of her <br>body and even her shoes were engaged in Zikr. She said to <br>me 'Aspire to possess me; I love you.\" And then she recited <br>a few couplets depicting the eagerness of a lover. When I <br>woke up from the dream, I vowed not to sleep any more <br>during the night. It is reported that for full forty years he <br>never slept at night, and said Ishaa and Fajr salaats with <br>the same wudhu. <br>Story- I1 <br>Shaikh Mazhar Sa'di (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous <br>pious man, kept weeping for sixty years in love and eager- <br>ness for Allah. One night he saw in a dream a few damsels <br>by the side of pearl trees with gold branches, on the bank of <br>the brook brimming with fluid musk, pure and fragrant. <br>The girls were hymning the glory of Allah. He asked their <br>identity. In reply they recited two couplets, which meant, <br>\"We have been created by the Sustainer of mankind and <br>Lord of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for those <br>people who keep standing before Allah all night long and <br>hymning in supplication to Him.\" <br>Story -111 <br>Abu Bakr Dharir (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"There <br>lived a young slave with me. He fasted all day and stood in <br>Tahajjud all night long. One day he came to me and re- <br>lated: \"Last night against my usual practice I went to sleep. <br>1 saw in my dream that the wail of the Mihraab was <br>cracked, and from the crevice ap:3eared a few damsels. One <br>of them was very ugly. I asked one of the pretty damsels <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>who they were. She replied that they were my previous <br>nights and that the ugly one was this night.\" <br>An eminent Shaikh says: \"One night I was in a deep <br>sleep and could not get up for Tahajjud. I saw in my dream <br>a girl of such beauty as I had never seen in my life. She was <br>emitting such fragrance as I had never smelt before. She <br>handed over to me a piece of paper on which were written <br>three couplets, which meant, 'You were so enamoured of <br>deep sleep that you have become unmindful of the high <br>balconies of Paradise, where you have to abide for ever <br>with no fear of death. Wake up! It is better to recite the <br>Qur'an in Tahajjud than to sleep.\" since then, wherever I <br>feel sleepy, these couplets come to my mind and the sleep <br>goes away.\" <br>Ataa (Rahmatullah alaih) writes, \"I went to the market. <br>A person had a slave girl to sell, who was said to be mad; I <br>purchased her for seven dinaars and brought her to my <br>house. After a portion of the night had passed, I noticed <br>that she got up, performed wudhu and started her salaat. In <br>her salaat she wept so much that I thought she would die <br>of excessive crying. After finishing the salaat, she began to <br>supplicate before Allah saying, '0my Lord! By the love <br>Thou bearest for me, show mercy on me.' I interrupted by <br>telling her that she should rather say, 'By the love that I <br>have for Thee . . .\" She got irritated at this suggestion and <br>said, 'By Allah Himself! Had He not loved me, I would not <br>be standing here before Him while you are in your bed.' <br>Then she fell prostrate and recited a few couplets purport- <br>ing, 'I am growing more and more restless. How can one <br>rest whose peace of mind is taken away by love, eagerness <br>and constant anxiety? 0,Allah! Show mercy and give some <br>glad tidings.' Then she prayed in a lou l voice thus, '0 <br>Allah! So far the matter between me and Thee has been a <br>secret. Now people have come to know of it. 0,Allah! Call <br>me back.' After saying this, she cried c l ~ u d  <br>and died on the <br>spot.\" <br>story-VI <br>A similar thing happened with Sirri (Rahmatuliah <br>alaih). He writes: \"I bought a slave woman to attend on me. <br><br>i-<br>r <br>I <br>Part I11 (b)-Stories of the Pious <br>7 7 <br>She served me for some time, but I was in the dark about <br>her state of affairs. She had a corner in the house reserved <br>for her salaat. After finishing her job, she would .go there <br>and offer her salaat. One night, I noticed her performing <br>salaat and then supplicating before Allah. While making <br>her supplication, she said, 'By the love Thou hast for me, <br>do such and such a thing for me.' I shouted out to her, '0 <br>woman, say by the love that I have for Thee.' She retorted, <br>'My Master, if He had not loved me, He would not have <br>made me stand for salaat and deprive you thereof.' Next <br>morning I sent for her and said to her, 'You are a misfit in <br>0 -<br>your present job. You are exclusively meant for Allah's ser- 14 <br>vice. I then gave her some gifts and set her free.\" <br>b'm <br>Story-VII <br>Sirri Saqti (Rahmatullah alaih) writes about another <br>woman: \"When she stood up for Tahajjud she would say, <br>'0 Allah! Satan is but Thy creation. Thou hast full power <br>over him. He sees me and I cannot see him. Thou see-est <br>him and hast control over all his actions, while he has no <br>control over Thee. 0,Allah! repel the evil that he wishes to <br>do me. Requit the wrong he may do to deceive me. I seek <br>Thy refuge from his evil designs and with Thy help I cast <br>him away.' Thereafter she would cry bitterly. And as a <br>result thereof she lost the sight of one eye. People admon- <br>ished her to stop excessive weeping, lest she should lose <br>her other eye as well. She replied, \"If it is destined to be an <br>eye of Paradise, Allah will grant me better than this; but if <br>it be that of Hell, then the sooner it is lost the better.\" <br>Shaikh Abu Abdullah Jilaa says: \"One day my mother <br>asked my father to fetch some fish from the market. My <br>father left for the market and I also accompanied him. The <br>fish was bought and we needed a porter to carry it for us. <br>We engaged a boy who was standing there and who had of- <br>fered to do the job for us. He put the load on his head and <br>followed us. While we were on our way, we happened to <br>hear the Azaan. The boy abruptly spoke, 'Allah's sum-<br>moner has summoned me; I have to take my wudhu too. I <br>shall now carry the fish after salaat. If you like you may <br>wait, otherwise here it is.\" Saying this he put the load <br>down and left for the musjid. My father thought when the <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>poor boy could place his trust in Allah so much, we must <br>as well do so in a greater degree. He, therefore, left the fish <br>there and took me to the musjid. When we three returned <br>after saying salaat, we found the fish lying in the same <br>place as we had left it. The boy then carried it to our house. <br>My father related the strange story to my mother who in- <br>sisted that the boy should be invited to eat some fish with <br>us, When the invitation was extended to him, he said, <br>'Excuse me I am fasting.' My father then requested him to <br>have iftaar at our place. To this he said, 'It is not possible <br>for me to return once I am gone. Just possibly, I may stay in <br>a musjid close to your place; if so, then I shall join you in <br>your dinner.' Saying this he went to the musjid and re- <br>turned after Maghrib. When the dinner was over, I showed <br>him the room where he could rest in privacy. Now, there <br>lived a crippled woman in our neighbourhood. We were <br>surprised to see her walking quite hale and hearty. When <br>we enquired from her how she got cured, she said, 'I <br>prayed to Allah to heal me for the sake of the blessings that <br>your guest carries. No sooner I prayed than I was healed.' <br>When we went to find the boy in the room where we had <br>left him, the door was shut and the boy was nowhere to be <br>seen.\" <br>story-1X <br>It is said of a pious man that once he had a sore on his <br>foot. According to the opinion of the surgeons, if his foot <br>was not amputated, the sore might prove fatal. His mother <br>proposed that the operation should be done while he was <br>absorbed in his salaat. This was done, and no pain was felt <br>by him. <br>Abu 'Aamir (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"I saw a slave <br>woman on sale for a very small sum. She was very ema- <br>ciated and her hair was dirty. I took pity on her and pur- <br>chased her. I said to her, 'Come, woman, let us go and <br>make purchases for Ramadhaan.' She remarked, 'Alhamdu- <br>lillah, all the months are alike for me.' She fasted on all <br>days and stood in salaat for all nights. When Eid drew near, <br>I said to her, 'Woman! You will go with me tomorrow to <br>make purchases for Eid. She remarked, 'My master! You <br>are too much absorbed in this world.' She then went into <br>Part I11 (b)-Stories of the Pious <br>her room and started her salaat. She was reciting Soorah <br>Ibrahim and when she reached the 16th verse of the Soorah <br>(viz., <br>'Hell is before him and he is made to drink boiling fetid <br>water', which described the doom of a disbeliever, she re- <br>peated it again and again, and then gave out a cry and fell <br>dead.\" <br>h <br>0 ,  <br>Everybody knows Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahrnatullah <br>alaih). After the four Khulafaa-ur Raashideen he is the most <br>eminent Khalifah. His wife says, \"There may be other <br>people more particular about wudhu and salaat; but I have <br>never seen anybody fearing Allah more than my husband. <br>After his daily Ishaa, he would sit at a place reserved for <br>his salaat and raise his hands in supplication and keep <br>crying before Allah till sleep overpowered him. Whenever <br>he woke during the night, he would again start praying and <br>crying before Allah.\" <br>It is said that since his becoming Khalifah he never <br>shared the bed with his wife. His wife was the daughter of <br>the great King Abdul Malik. Her father had given her much <br>jewellery in dowry, which included a marvellous diamond. <br>He said to his wife, \"Either part with all your jewellery for <br>the sake of Allah, so that I may deposit it in the Baitul <br>Maal or be separated from me. I would not like to live in a <br>house where there is so much wealth.\" His wife replied, \"I <br>can .part with a thousand times more wealth, but I cannot <br>leave you.\" She then deposited everything she had in the <br>Baitul Maal. After the death of Umar bin Abdul Aziz, when <br>Yazeed son of Abdul Malik succeeded him as Khalifa, he <br>said to his sister, \"If you like you may have your jewellery <br>back from the Baitul Maal. She replied, \"How can the <br>wealth I discarded during my husband's lifetime, satisfy <br>me after his death.\" <br>Umar bin Abdul Aziz was on his death-bed when he <br>inquired from the persons round him about the cause of his <br>disease. Someone said, \"People think it is the effect of <br>black magic.\" He said, \"No, it is not magic.\" He then sent <br>for a particular slave of his and said to him, \"What made <br>you poison me?\" He replied, \"One hundred dinaara and a <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>promise of liberty.\" Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) took those dinaars from the slave and deposited <br>them in the Baitul Maal, and advised him to run away to <br>some distant place where he could not be seized. <br>Just before his death, Muslimah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>came to him and said, \"Nobody has ever treated his chil- <br>dren as you are doing. None of your thirteen sons has any- <br>thing to live on.\" He sat up in his bed and said, 'I have not <br>held back from my sons what they were entitled to. I have, <br>of course, refused them what was actually due to others. If <br>my sons are righteous, then Allah will surely be their <br>guardian as He has said in His Book: He is the guardian of <br>the righteous (VII:196)', but if they are wrong-doers, then <br>why should I care for them?\" <br>Story-XI1 <br>Muhammad bin Mu.nkadir (Rahmatullah alaih) was a <br>Hafiz of Hadith. One night, he wept excessively in his Ta- <br>hajjud. When someone inquired about it, he said, \"During <br>Qiraat, I came across the following words of the Qur'an: <br>\"And the evils that they earned will confront them; <br>and they will be surrounded by what they used to scoff <br>at.\" <br>(XXXIX: 48) <br>He was very anxious and worried at the time of his <br>death, and said that these same words of the Qur'an were <br>looming before him. <br>Story-XI11 <br>Thaabit Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) is another Hafiz <br>of Hadith. He used to cry a great deal while supplicating <br>before Allah. Someone warned him that he would lose his <br>eyesight if he did not stop weeping like that. He replied to <br>him, \"What use sre these eyes if these do not weep before <br>Allah.\" <br>He used to ask in his prayer, \"0,Allah! Permit ms to <br>offer my salaat in my grave, if ever you grant this privilege <br>to any of Thy slaves!\" Abu Sanaan (Rahmatullah alaih) nar- <br>rates, \"By Allah! I was among those present at the burial of <br>Thaabit Banaani. Just after he had been placed in his grave, <br>one of the bricks from the side fell off. I peeped into the pit <br>to find to my great amazement, that Thaabit was offering <br>Part I11 (b)-Stories of the Pious <br>his salaat. I said to a person standing by my side, 'Look <br>what is that.' He advised me to keep quiet. After the burial, <br>we went to his daughter and inquired from her, 'What was <br>the special practice sf your father?' She wanted to know <br>what made us put that question. We related to her the inci- <br>dent at the grave. She said, \"He has been constant in Tahaj- <br>jud for fifty years and prayed every morning before Allah to <br>allow him to offer salaat in the grave if that privilege could <br>be granted to anybody.\" <br>Before finishing this chapter, I give below the pursuits <br>(as regards salaat) of some of our eminent Muslim ances- <br>tors: <br>1. \t Imaam Ahmad bin Hambal (Rahmatullah alaih) is <br>the famous Imaam of one, of the four schools of <br>Muslim jurisprudence. Besides being engaged in <br>his usual work, he used to offer daily three hun- <br>dred rakaats of nafl salaat. After he was lashed by <br>the king for refusal to submit to the royal edict, he <br>became very weak and reduced his routine nafl <br>salaat to one hundred and fifty rakaats. We should <br>not forget that he was eighty at that time. <br>2. \t<br>Imaam Shaafi'ee (Rahmatullah alaih) another emi- <br>nent Imaam of Muslim jurisprudence, used to <br>finish reciting the Qur'an sixty times in his salaat <br>during Ramadhaan. A person narrates, \"I re-<br>mained with Imaam Shaafi'ee for several days and <br>found him sleeping only for a while at night.\" <br>3. \t<br>Imaam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) is famous <br>for his vigil. It is said that for thirty, forty or fifty <br>years (according to the information of different <br>narrators) he offered his Fajr prayer with the <br>wudhu for Ishaa. He would go to sleep only for a <br>few minutes in the afternoon saying, \"It is sunnat <br>to sleep in the afternoon.\" <br>4. \t It is said about Sa'eed bin Musayyab (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) that for fifty years he offered his Fajr salaat <br>with the wudhu performed at Ishaa. <br>Imaam Ghazzali (Rahmatullah alaih) on the auth- <br>ority of Abu Taalib Makki reported the same prac- <br>tice by no less than forty Taabi'ees, some of whom <br>had been doing it for forty years continuously. <br>5. \t Muhammad bin Nasr (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous Muhaddith. His devotion to salaat had no <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>parallel. Once while in salaat, he was stung on his <br>forehead by a wasp and though blood came out, <br>neither did he stir nor did he allow it to disturb <br>his devotion in salaat. It is said that in salaat, he <br>stood motionless like a stick planted in the <br>ground. <br>6. \t It is reported about Baqi bin Mukhallid (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) that he used to recite the complete <br>Qur'an every night in thirteen rakaats of Tahajjud <br>and Witr. <br>7. \t Hannaad (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith. One <br>of his pupils narrates, \"Hannaad used to weep <br>very much. One day after he had finished our <br>lesson in the morning, he continued to offer nafl <br>salaat till midday. He went to his place for a short <br>interval and then returned for his Zuhr. He again <br>engaged himself in nafl salaat till Asr. Between <br>Asr and Maghrib, he recited the Qur'an. I left him <br>after Maghrib. I said to one of his neighbours, 'Our <br>Shaikh prays so much. It is really wonderful.' He <br>said, \"He had been doing this for the last seventy <br>years. You will wonder still more if you see his <br>prayers during the night.\" <br>8. \t Masrooq (Rahmatullah alaih) is another Muhad- <br>dith. His wife narrates, \"He used to offer such long <br>rakaats that his legs would get swollen and I sat <br>behind weeping in pity for him.\" <br>9. \t Abu Itaab Sulami (Rahmatullah alaih) is reported <br>to have been fasting during the day and weeping <br>during the night for full forty years. <br>10. It is said about .a Sayyid that continuously for <br>twelve days he has been offering his salaat with <br>the same wudhu. For fifteen years, his back had <br>not touched the bed. He would also gc without <br>food for days together. <br>Eesides the above, there are numerous records of the <br>pious pursuits of the heroes of Islamic History. It is diffi- <br>cult to cover all of them in this book. All that has been said <br>here is sufficient to serve as examples. May Allah, thrpugh <br>His Grace, grant me and the readers of this book the <br>sirength to follow in the footsteps of these blessed people! <br>Aameen! <br><br>QUOTATIONSFROM HADITH <br>Hadhrat Ammar bin Yaasir (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) saying: \"When a person finishes his salaat, he <br>gets one tenth, one ninth, one eighth, one seventh, one <br>sixth, one fifth, one fourth, one third or one half of the <br>maximum reward (according to the quality of salaat <br>performed by him).\" <br>This shows that the reward is given in proportion to <br>the sincerity and devotion with which salaat is performed. <br>So much so, that some get only one tenth of the total <br>reward. There are others who get a reward ranging from <br>one tenth to one half of the maximum. It is also correct to <br>say that there are some who receive the reward in full and <br>there are others who get no reward at all. <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah has a standard for <br>fardh salaat. An account is kept of the measure by which a <br>salaat falls short of that standard. <br>It is said in the hadith that devotion in salaat .will be <br>the first thing to be taken away from the world. A time will <br>come when not a single person in the whole congregation <br>will offer his salaat with proper devotion. <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a person offers his salaat at its fixed <br>hours with proper wudhu, with humility and submis- <br>sion and with qiyaam, ruku and sajdah done satisfac- <br>torily, then such a salaat rises up in a bright and <br>beautiful form and blesses the person in words: 'May <br>Allah guard you as you have guarded me.' On the other <br>hand, if a person is not punctual with his salaat nor <br>does he perform wudhu, qiyaam, ruku and sajdah <br>properly, then salaat rises up in an ugly and dark <br>shape and curses the person saying, \"May Allah ruin <br>you as you have ruined me!\" Then it is flung back like <br>a dirty rag at the face of the person.\" <br>Lucky are those whose salaat is so perfect in all re- <br>spects that this most important worship of Allah would <br>pray for them. But what to say about the salaat which most <br>of the people are wont? They go into sajdah direct from <br>ruku, and they hardly lift their head from the first sajdah <br>when they go for the second like a crow pecking at some- <br>thing. The curse that such a person deserves is mentioned <br>in this hadith. When the salaat is cursing us then what else <br>can check our downfall? This is why the condition of the <br>Muslims is deteriorating day by day in every nook and <br>corner of the world. <br>The same description is given in another hadith, with <br>the addition that a salaat offered by a person with sincerity <br>and devotion rises up highly illuminated, the gates of <br>Heaven are let open for its reception, and then it intercedes <br>(before Allah) for His devotee. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"The likeness of a person not bowing fully in ruku is that <br>of a pregnant woman aborting just before delivery.\" <br>In a hadith, it is stated, \"There are many fasting per- <br>sons who get nothing out of their fast except hunger and <br>thirst, and there are many worshippers who keep a vigil <br>but get nothing from their vigil except sleeplessness. <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br><br>Part I11 (c)-Qun tations from Ahadith <br>I <br>she heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying. <br>~ <br>, <br>I <br>i <br>I<br>\"Allah has decided to save (from punishment of the Here- <br>after) a person coming before Him who has been offering <br>salaat five times daily at its fixed hours, with due sincerity <br>and devotion and with proper wudhu. As regards a person <br>who does not so come before Allah, there is no guarantee <br>for him. He may be forgiven by Allah's special Grace or <br>taken to task. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>his companions and said, \"Do you know what Allah has <br>said?\" The companions replied, \"Allah and His Apostle <br>know best.\" He repeated the question twice and the com- <br>panions made the same reply each time. Then he said, <br>\"Allah says, 'By my Greatness and My Glory. I must bring <br>into Paradise the person offering salaat five times daily at <br>its fixed hours. As regards the person who does not ensure <br>his salaat, I may forgive him by My mercy or take him to <br>task.' \" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"We heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, 'The first among the doings of a person to be <br>reckoned for on the Day of Judgement shall be his <br>salaat. A person will succeed and attain his goal if his <br>salaat is accepted, and he will fail and lose badly if it <br>is rejected. If any deficiency is found in his fardh <br>salaat, Allah will say (to the Angels): \"Look for any <br>nafl salaat in his account\". Then the deficiency in his <br>fardh salaat will be made good by nafl salaat. The rest <br>of the religious practices (viz. Fast, Zakaat etc.) will <br>then be reckoned for in the same manner.\" <br>This hadith shows that we should have adequate nafl <br>salaat to our credit to make up any deficiency in our fardh <br>salaat. It is a habit with many people to say. \"It is enough <br>to observe only the fardh salaat. nafl salaat is meant for the <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>eminent. No doubt it is enough to offer fardh salaat prop- <br>erly, but is it so easy to observe it to the proper standard? <br>Most probably, there will always be some deficiency in one <br>respect or the other, and there is no way out to make up <br>that deficiency except through nafl salaat. <br>There is another hadith which deals with this point <br>more elaborately. It declares, \"Salaat is the foremost duty <br>enjoined by Allah and the first thing to be presented before <br>Allah, and the first thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement. If the fardh salaat is found wanting in quality, <br>then its deficiency will be made good through nafl salaat. <br>The fasts of Ramadhaan will be the next to be reckoned for <br>and any deficiency therein will be made good through nafl <br>Fasts. Then Zakaat shall be reckoned for in a similar <br>manner. If after adding nafl the good deeds are found <br>heavier in the scales, the person concerned shall be sent to <br>Paradise, otherwise he shall meet his doom in Hell.\" Such <br>was the practice of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) that when anybody embraced Islaam at his hand, the <br>first thing he taught him was salaat. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Qurt (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) saying \"Salaat will be the first thing to be <br>reckoned for on the Day of Judgement. If this is found <br>satisfactory, then the rest of the deeds will also come <br>out as such. If this is not so, then the remaining deeds <br>are sure to be found wanting. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) during his cali- <br>phate had issued a proclamation to all the officers under <br>him saying, \"I regard salaat as the most important duty. A <br>peran who ensures salaat is likely to observe other injuc- <br>tions of Islam as well; but if he discards salaat, he will <br>more easily damage the rest of Islaam.\" <br>The above saying of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and the proclamation of Hazrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) are also corroborated by. another hadith, \"Satan <br><br>Part 111 (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>8 7<br>I<br>is scared of a Muslim so long as he is mindful of his salaat; <br>but no sooner he neglects the salaat than Satan descends on <br>him and becomes hopeful of leading him astray, and then <br>he can easily be lured to commit more serious wrongs and <br>major sins. This is exactly what is meant by Almighty <br>Allah when He says, <br>\"Lo! salaat preserveth from lewdness and inequity\" <br>Ir <br>(XXIX:45) :3 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abu Qataadah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) narrates, \"The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) once said, 'The worst thief is one who steals <br>from his salaat.' The companions inquired, 'How can <br>one steal from his salaat? 0,Prophet of Allah!' He re- <br>plied, 'When one does not do his ruku and sajdah <br>properly.' <br>There are many other Ahaadith conveying the same <br>meaning. Stealing is a very disgraceful act and a thief is de- <br>spised by everybody. What about a person who is declared, <br>'the worst thief', by no less a person than the Prophet him- <br>self? <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radiyallaho anho) narrates, \"Once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) looked up towards <br>the sky and said, 'The knowledge of Deen is soon to be <br>taken away from this world.' Ziyaad (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>who was also present there inquired, 'How can the knowl- <br>edge of Deen be taken way, 0 ,  Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), when we are teaching the Qur'an to our <br>children and this process will continue in our posterity?' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him, <br>'Ziyaad! I always took you to be an intelligent person. <br>Don't you see that the Jews and the Christians are also <br>teaching their Bibles to their children? Has this prevented <br>Virtues of Sdaat <br>their deterioration?\" One of Hadhrat Abu Darda's (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) pupils says.\"After hearing this hadith from <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anha), I went to Hadhrat <br>Ubaadah (Radhiyallaho anho) and related the hadith to <br>him.\" He said, \"Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) is quite <br>right. May I tell you the first thing that will be taken away <br>from this world? It is devotion in salaat. You will see that <br>not a single person in the full congregation is saying his <br>salaat with devotion.\" Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the confidante of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), was also heard saying, \"Devotion in salaat shall be <br>the first thing to disappear.\" <br>It is said in a hadith, \"Allah does not pay any attention <br>to that salaat with which ruku and sajdah are not per- <br>formed properly.\" <br>Another hadith says, \"A person has been offering <br>salaat for sixty years, but in fact not a single salaat of his is <br>accepted by Allah. This is because he has been careless <br>about his ruku in some salaats and about his sajdah in <br>others.\" <br>A great stress is laid on the proper performance of <br>salaat in the famous Epistles of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih). His discourses on the subject cover a <br>good portion of the Epistles. In one of them he writes, \"It is <br>necessary adong other things that we should be particular <br>about keeping the fingers of our hands together while in <br>sajdah and separated while in ruku. These regulations are <br>not without a purpose.\" He further writes, \"To keep our <br>glance at the place of sajdah while standing, on our feet <br>while in ruku, on our nose while in sajdah, and on our <br>hands while in Qa'dah, goes a long way in keeping the de- <br>sired concentration in salaat.\" When such ordinary regu- <br>lations, which are only mustahab, increase the value of our <br>salaat, you can well imagine how much benefit we shall <br>derive if we be particular of other regulations, which are <br>either sunnat or otherwise more important. <br>I <br>Part 111 (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>gJ,eu>,!'&,& d,$&,h.& <br>;d 3$,&jGq <br>s<br>. <br>I<br>,<br>.<br>.<br> . ..* <br>w j! y'i\" Lj?b y 6Ljl +I <br>*#I <br>Hadhrat Umme Roomaan (wife of Abu Bakr) (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) narrates, \"Once I was offering my salaat, <br>when I unknowingly started leaning sometimes to one <br>side and sometimes to the other. Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) saw me doing this and repri- <br>manded me so harshly that I was about to abandon my <br>salaat with fear. He told me later that he had heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"When a <br>person stands for salaat, he should keep his body at <br>rest and he should not behave like the Jews, since to <br>remain motionless is one of the complements of <br>salaat.\" <br>Keeping the body at rest during salaat is enjoined in <br>many ahaadith. In the beginning, it was a habit with the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he kept looking <br>towards the heaven in expectation of Hadhrat Jibra-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) to bring him some revelation, so much so <br>that his eyes would sometimes rise up unconsciously even <br>during salaat. When the first two verses of Soorah XXIII <br>(viz., <br>(Successful indeed are the believers who are humble in <br>their salaat) were revealed, he began to keep his gaze down <br>while in salaat. It is also said about the companions that in <br>the beginning they would sometime cast their glances here <br>and there during their salaat but, after these verses were re- <br>vealed, they gave up this practice. Explaining these verses, <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says, <br>\"When the Sahabah stood for salaat they never looked this <br>side or that side. They remained attentive in salaat with <br>their eyes fixed at the place of sajdah, totally absorbed in <br>Allah, their Lord. Someone inquired from Hadhrat Ali <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), 'What is devotion?' He replied, 'Con- <br>centration in salaat is included in devotion.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Humble' <br>(mentioned in the above verses) are those who fear Allah <br>and remain motionless in salaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"Once <br>Virtues of Sdaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, 'Seek refuge <br>in Allah from sanctimonious devotion.' We inquired, 'What <br>is sanctimonious devotion, 0 Prophet of Allah! (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). He replied, 'To feign concentration, with <br>nifaaq lurking in the heart.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) relates a simi- <br>lar hadith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"Hypocritical devotion is that <br>in which a person outwardly pretends concentration, while <br>his heart is devoid of that.\" <br>Hadhrat Qataadah (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"For de- <br>votion in salaat, the heart should be full of Allah's fear, and <br>the gaze should be kept down.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once saw a <br>person fondling his beard while in salaat. He remarked, \"If <br>his heart were blessed with devotion, then his entire body <br>would be at rest.\" <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) once inquired <br>from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what <br>his opinion was about the practice of looking around while <br>in salaat. He said, \"It is a damage to salaat caused by <br>Satan.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"People in the habit of looking up while in salaat must give <br>up that habit, lest their gaze may become fixed and not <br>return to them.\" <br>It has been said by many of the companions and their <br>successors that devotion means tranquillity in salaat. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported (by many <br>narrators) to have said, \"Offer each salaat (with) such (de- <br>votion) as if it were the last salaat of your life.\" <br>Hadhrat Imraan bin Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates, Someone inquired of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) about the meaning of the verse in <br>Qur'an: <br>' <br><br>Part IIi (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>'Lo! Salaat restrains from shameful and unjust deeds. <br>(XXIX:45) <br>He replied, \"Salaat is no salaat if it does not preserve <br>one from lewdness and iniquity.\" <br>No doubt, salaat is a very valuable service and when <br>offered properly, results in preservation from all undesir- <br>ables. If this result is not achieved, then there is something <br>lacking in the proper performance of salaat. There are <br>many other ahaadith conveying this meaning. Hadhrat Ibn <br>Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Salaat has the power to <br>check the inclination to sins.\" <br>Hadhrat Abul Aaliyah (Radhiyallaho anho) explaining <br>the same verse of the Qur'an writes: \"There are three essen- <br>tials of salaat: Sincerity, Fear of Allah, and His remem- <br>brance. Salaat is no salaat if these three are missing. <br>Sincerity heralds virtuous deeds, fear of Allah expels vices, <br>and His remembrance is the Qur'an, which in itself is a <br>guidance towards good and guard against evil.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Salaat <br>that does not prevent from lewdness and iniquity instead <br>of bringing close to Allah, takes away from Him.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"A person who does not follow up his salaat, has actually <br>offered no salaat. To follow up the salaat is to shun lewd- <br>ness and iniquity.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>'A person came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and reported about a certain man, who was in the habit of <br>i <br>I <br>offering salaat for the whole night and then committing a <br>larceny before daybreak. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) remarked, \"His salaat will very soon wean him off <br>I <br>that sin.' This shows that the evil habits can be got rid of by <br>adhering to salaat with due sincerity. It is a difficult and <br>lengthy affair to redeem each and every bad habit. On the <br>contrary, it is easier and quicker to start offering salaat with <br>proper care when through the blessings that follow it, bad <br>habits are sure to disappear one by one.\" May Allah grant <br>me strength to say my salaat properly! <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Jabir (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"The best salaat is one with prolonged rakaats.\" Muja- <br>hid while explaning the verse <br>\"And stand up with Qunoot to Allah (ii-238)\" says <br>Qunoot comprises all such things as proper bowing, <br>devotion, long rakaat, keeping the eyes down, lowering <br>of shoulders in submission and fear of Allah. When- <br>ever a companion of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) stood for salaat, he would not look <br>here and there or level the pebbles at the place of <br>sajdah (while prostrating) or engage himself in any <br>absurd act, or think of any worldly thing (except unin- <br>tentionally), all for fear of Allah.\" <br>Many interpretations have been given to the word <br>Qunoot, which occurs in the Qur'an in the verse mentioned <br>in this hadith. According to one of the interpretations, <br>Qunoot means silence. In the beginning of Islam, it was <br>permissible to talk or to return greetings during salaat, but <br>when this verse was revealed, talking during salaat was ab- <br>solutely forbidden. Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood' (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"In the beginning whenever I visited the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), I would greet him <br>with 'Assalamu alaikum' and he would reply with 'Wa <br>alaikumus salaam' even if he were engaged in salaat. Once <br>I visited him while he was in salaat and greeted him as <br>usual, but he did not reply. I grew very anxious, fearing <br><br>Part I11 (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>i \t<br>that his attitude might be due to Allah's displeasure for me. <br>I <br>All sorts of anxious thoughts began to enter my mind. One <br>moment, I would think the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>J <br>sallam) was angry with me and then some other saddening <br>I \t<br>explanation would occur to me. When the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) finished his salaat, he said, \"Allah <br>amends His commandments as He pleases. He has now for- <br>bidden any talking during salaat.\" He then recited the <br>verse, 'And stand up with Qunoot to Allah' (11: 238) and <br>I <br>said, salaat is now meant exclusively to hymn the glory, <br>I <br>praise and sanctity of Allah.\" <br>0,<br>Hadhrat Mu'aawiyah bin Hakam Salami (Radhiyallaho $4<br>anho) says, \"When I visited Madinah to embrace Islaam, I <br>c~<br>T<br>was taught many things. One of those was that I should say <br>'Yarhamukallaah' when anybody sneezed and exlaimed <br>'Alhamdulillaah'. As I was new in Islaam, I did not know <br>that this was not to be done during salaat. Once we were all <br>standing in salaat when somebody sneezed. I immediately <br>shouted, 'Yarhamukallaah'. Everybody began to stare at me. <br>As I did not know then that we were not to talk in salaat, I <br>protested saying, 'Why are you all casting these angry <br>looks?' They hushed me up with a gesture, but I could not <br>understand their behaviour, although I decided to be quiet. <br>I <br>When salaat was over, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>I <br>lam) called me. Neither did he beat or rebuke me, nor was <br>he harsh to me. He simply said, 'It is not permitted to talk <br>in salaat. Salaat is the occasion for praising the glory and <br>magificence of Allah and reciting the Qur'an.' By Allah, I <br>i <br>I <br>have never met, before or after, a teacher as affectionate as <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Another interpretation is given by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) in which he says that Qunoot means <br>devotion. The words of Mujahid given above are based on <br>this interpretation. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) says, \"In the beginning, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) used to tie himself up with a string while <br>r' <br>in Tahajjud, so that he might prevent sleep over-powering <br>him. It was for this that the following verse was revealed in <br>the Qur'an: <br>\"We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) this Qur'an that Thou should be <br>distressed.\" <br>(XX: 2) <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is reported in many ahaadith that the Prophet's (Sal- <br>lallah alaihi wasallam) feet would get swollen on account <br>of standing for long hours during Tahajjud. Out of mere <br>kindness and affection for his followers, he, however, ad- <br>vised them to be moderate in their worship, lest any ex- <br>cessiveness should lead to deflection. That is why we find <br>him forbidding a woman from tying herself up for avoiding <br>sleep during salaat. <br>We should remember that a salaat with long rakaat is <br>surely better and more valuable, provided the endurance <br>limits are not exceeded. After all, there is some meaning in <br>the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) offering such <br>lengthy salaat that would give him swollen feet. When the <br>companions requested him to reduce his toil in worship, as <br>he had been assured of forgiveness in Soorah Fath: <br>[That Allah may forgive thee of thy sins that which is <br>past and that which is to come (XLVIII:Z), he used to say, <br>\"Why should I not, then, be a grateful slave of Allah?\" <br>It is stated in a hadith that when, the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) offered his salaat, his bosom would <br>give a constant groaning sound, which resembled that of a <br>grinding mill. In another hadith, this sound is likened to <br>that of a boiling kettle. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates, \"On the eve of Badr, I noticed that the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stood under a tree, busy in <br>salaat and crying before Allah all night long till daybreak.\" <br>It is said in a number of ahaadith, \"Allah is very much <br>pleased with certain persons one of them is he who for- <br>sakes his bed shared with his dear and lovely wife and en- <br>gages himself in Tahajjud on a winter night. Allah is very <br>much pleased with him, takes pride in him, and in spite of <br>being All-knowing inquires from the angels, 'What made <br>this slave of mine forsake his bed and stand up like this?' <br>The Angels reply, 'The hope of winning Thy Bounty and <br>Grace, and the fear of Thy displeasure.' At this Allah says, <br>'Listen, I bestow upon him what he hopes for and grant <br>him refuge from what he is afraid of.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"None <br>receives a better reward from Allah more than he who is <br>blessed to offer two 'rakaats of salaat.\" <br>It has often been mentioned in the Qur'an and ahaa- <br>dith that the Angels are perpetually engaged in worship. <br>Part I11 (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>There are some who shall remain in ruku and some in <br>sajdah till eternity. Allah has combined all these postures <br>of the Angels in our salaat, so that we may get our shares <br>from each type of their worship. Recitation of the Qur'an in <br>salaat is an addition over and above their worship. While <br>salaat is the sum total of all the postures in the Angels' <br>methods of worship, it gives out its best when it is offered <br>by a person possessing angelic habits. That is why the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"For (a good) <br>salaat, keep your back and stomach light.\" The back of a <br>person is said to be light when he has very few worldly en- <br>cumbrances, and his stomach is light when he eats moder- <br>ately to avoid indolence and laziness, which is a sure <br>outcome of gluttony. <br>REQUISITES OF GOOD SALAAT SUGGESTED BY <br>SOOFIA <br>The Soofia write: \"There are twelve thousand virtues <br>in salaat. which can be achieved through twelve points. If a <br>person is to acquire full benefit from salaat, then, he must <br>take care of these points. Sincerity is of course essential at <br>every step. These points are as follows: <br>1. Knowledge: An action performed without knowl-<br>edge is far inferior to the one done with full knowledge <br>about it. We should therefore know: <br>(a) Which \t of the Islamic Practices are fardh and <br>which are sunnat. <br>(b) What is fardh and what is sun& \t in wudhu and <br>salaat. <br>(c) How does Satan cause obstruction in the proper <br>observance of salaat. <br>2. Wudhu: We must try to: <br>(a) Clean our heart of jealously and malice, just as we <br>wash the other parts of our body. <br>(b) \t Keep ourselves clean of sins. <br>(c) Be neither wasteful \t nor abstemious in the use of <br>water. <br>3. Dress: It should be: <br>(a) Got through honest living. <br>(b) Clean. <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>(c) According to the Sunnat, e.g. the ankles should <br>not be covered. <br>(d) Simple, and should not display vanity and pride. <br>4. Time: We should be: <br>(a) Able to tell correct time at any moment. <br>(b) Always watchful about Azaan. <br>(c) Particular about the time of salaat, lest we should <br>be too late for it. <br>5. Qiblah: There are three things to be ensured in <br>facing Qiblah: <br>(a) We must face Qiblah physically. <br>(b) Have the heart in union with Allah, for He is the <br>Qiblah of the heart. <br>(c) \t Be as attentive as a slave is before his master. <br>6. Intention: For this we need to be particular about <br>three things: <br>(a) We must be definite as to what salaat we are offer- <br>ing. <br>(b) Remain \t constantly conscious of our presence <br>before Allah, Who se6s us. <br>(c) \t Have perfect faith that Allah know all that is in <br>our hearts. <br>7. Takbeer Tahreemah: The essentials of 'Takbeer Tah- <br>reemah' are: <br>(a) \t TO pronounce the words correctly. <br>(b) To raise both hands right up to the ears. This sig- <br>nifies that we have severed our connection with <br>all, except Allah. <br>(c) \tTo feel the greatness of Allah in our heart when <br>we say Allaho Akbar. <br>8. Qiyaam: While in Qiyaam we should: <br>(a) \t Keep our gaze at the place of sajdah. <br>(b) Feel in our heart that we are standing before Allah. <br>(c) Not think of anything else. <br>9. Qiraat: The essentials of Qiraat are: <br>(a) \t To recite the Qur'an with Taj-weed. <br>(b) \t 7'9 ponder on the meanings of what we recite. <br>(c) \t To bind ourselves to what we recite. <br><br>Part 1II (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>10.Ruku: The essentials of Ruku are: <br>(a) \t To keep the back quite straight i.e. the whole body <br>above the legs should be in one straight line. <br>(b) To hold the knees firmly with fingers spread apart. <br>(c) To recite Tasbeeh with humility and devotion. <br>11.Sajdah: The essentials of Sajdah are: <br>(a) To place the hands flat and close to the ears. <br>(b) To keep elbows raised above the g~ound. <br>(c) \tTo recite Tasbeeh with devotion. <br>12. Qa'dah: The essentials of Qa'dah are: <br>(a) To sit up on the left foot, keeping the right \t one <br>erect. <br>(b) To recite Tashahhud with devotion, keeping the <br>meaning in mind, for it contains greetings for the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and prayer <br>for the Muslim brethren. <br>(c) \t To consider the concluding Salaam a definite <br>greeting to the Angels as well as the people on the <br>right and on the left. <br>As has been said already, sincerity is the essence of all <br>these points, which requires us: <br>1. \t To offer salaat with the sole purpose of pleasing <br>Allah. <br>2. \t<br>To understand that it is only through the grace and <br>favour of Allah that we are able to offer salaat. <br>3. \t<br>To hope for the reward promised by Allah. <br>SIGNIFICANCE OF WORDING OF SALAAT <br>Salaat is really a very blessed and auspicious observ- <br>ance. Every word uttered in it is imbued with Allah's great- <br>ness and sanctity. Thanaa, the opening prayer of salaat, <br>contains extremely virtuous and devotional meaning viz: <br>(I) Subhaanakallaahumma: 0,Allah! I praise Thy Sanc- <br>tity. Thou art free from all <br>blemishes. Thou art above <br>anything that is not the best. <br>(2) \t Wa biharndika: <br>I praise Thy Glory. All vir- <br>tues and beauties are admit- <br>tedly for Thee and befit <br>Thee. <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>(3) Wa tabaarakasmuka: <br>Thy name is blessed: and in <br>fact so blessed that blesses <br>everything over which it is <br>mentioned. <br>(4) IYa ta'ualaa jadduka: <br>Thy <br>eminence <br>is <br>most <br>exalted. Thy magnificence is <br>most sublime. <br>(5) Wa Jaa iluaha ghairuk: <br>There is no god save Thee. <br>None has ever been and <br>none shall ever be fit to be <br>worshipped save Thee. <br>Similary in ruku we recite \"Subhaana rabbiyal azeem.\" <br>which means: <br>\"My Magnificent and Almighty Allah is free from all <br>blemishes. I express my humbleiiess and weakness <br>before His Greatness by bowing my head before Him <br>(for the bowing of head is the symbol of humbleness <br>and submission, just as a stiff neck is the sign of <br>haughtiness and pride). I submit before all Thy com- <br>mandments and I take upon me Thy service. I am at <br>Thy command. Thou art really very Great and I submit <br>before Thy greatness.\" <br>Similary in sajdah we express our submission before <br>Allah the Highest, and declare Him above all defects. Our <br>head, which is considered as the most superb part of our <br>body along with our eyes, ears,nose and tongue, is placed <br>on- ground before Him in the hope that He would show <br>mercy and bestow His blessings on us. Standing with our <br>hands folded before Him this was the first expression of <br>our humbleness and submission. This was further aug- <br>mented by the bending of our head in ruku and it reached <br>its climax when we placed our head on the ground before <br>Him. In fact the whole salaat is an indication of humble- <br>ness and submission, and therefore a means of advance- <br>ment and success in the world and in the hereafter. May <br>Allah through His Kindness arouse me and all the Muslims <br>to offer such a salaat. <br>SALAAT OF FEW SAHAABAH, TAABI'EES AND SOOFIA <br>It is said about Hadhrat Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that whenever he performed wudhu, his face grew pale. <br>When someone inquired from him its cause, he replied. \"It <br><br>Part 111 (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>is time to stand before the most Majestic and Irresistable <br>Sovereign.\" On reaching the gate of the musjid he would <br>say, <br>\"0Allah! Thy slave is at Thy door, 0,the most Benefi- <br>cent! Here is a sinner before Thee: Thou hast enjoined <br>upon the good amongst us to overlook the faults of the <br>bad. 0 Allah, Thou art Good and I am bad So for the <br>sake of all that is most beautiful in Thee, overlook all <br>that is ugly in me. 0 ,  The most Bountiful.\" <br>(I <br>0.4 <br>He would then enter the musjid. <br>8 0<br>3 1  <br>Zainul Aabideen (Rahmatullah alaih) used to offer one <br>Zrij <br>:j<br>thousand rakaats of nafl salaat daily. He never missed his <br>Tahajjud, whether in journey or at home. His face grew <br>pale when he performed his wudhu and he would tremble <br>when he stood in salaat. Somebody asked him the reason <br>for that. He said, \"Don't you know before Whom I am going <br>to stand?\" Once when he was engaged in salaat, a fire <br>broke out in his house. He continued his salaat most <br>calmly. When asked about it, he remarked, \"The fire of the <br>hereafter kept me unmindful of the fire of this world.\" He <br>once said, \"The pride of a proud person surprises me. The <br>day before, he was a drop of a dirty fluid and tomorrow he <br>will be carrion, and still he is proud.\" He used to say, \"It is <br>strange that people do so much for the world, which is <br>transitory, and do nothing for the hereafter, where they are <br>to live for ever.\" He used to help the poor in the darkness <br>of night, so that they should not even know who helped <br>them. It came to light only after his death that no less than <br>one hundred families were being supported by him. <br>It is said about Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>the colour of his face would change and he would tremble <br>at the approach of the hour of salaat. On being asked by <br>someone he said, \"This is the time for discharging the trust <br>which the Heaven and the Earth and even the mountains <br>were afraid to bear. I do not know if I shall be able to dis-<br>charge it. \" <br>It is said of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that, when he hea~d the Azaan, he wept so much that <br>his shawl would get wet with his tears, his veins would <br>swell and his eyes would become red. Somebody said to <br>him, \"We do not see anything in the Azaan that should <br>make you so nervous.\" He replied, \"If people understood <br>what the mu'azzin announced t o  them, they would give up <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>sleep and forsake their comforts.\" He then explained to <br>him the warning conveyed by each word of the Azaan. <br>A person narrates, \"I happened to offer my Asr prayer <br>with Zunnoon Misri (Rahmatullah alaih). When he uttered <br>'Allah' (in takbeer), he was so much struck with awe on ac- <br>count of Allah's Majesty, as though his soul had departed, <br>and when he uttered 'Akbar' I felt my heart would burst <br>with fear of Allah. <br>Uwais Qarni (Rahmatullah alaih), a famous saint and <br>the most exalted of all the Taabi'ees, would spend his <br>whole night sometimes in ruku and sometimes in sajdah. <br>Asaam (Rahmatullah alaih) once inquired from Haatim <br>Zaahid Balkhi (Rahmatullah alaih) how he offered his <br>salaat. He replied: <br>\"When the hour for salaat draws near, I perform my <br>wudhu thoroughly and go to the place of salaat. When <br>I stand for salaat, I visualise the Ka'bah in front of me, <br>the Siraat under my feet, Paradise on my right, Hell on <br>my left and the Angel of death over my head; and I <br>think that this is my last salaat, so I may have no op- <br>portunity to say another; Allah alone knows what goes <br>on in my heart at that time. Then I say 'Allaho Akbar' <br>with full humility and recite the Holy Qur'an, ponder- <br>ing over its meaning. I do my ruku and sajdah with full <br>humbleness and submission, and finish my salaat <br>quite calmly, hoping that Allah will accept it through <br>His mercy, and fearing that it may be rejected if it is <br>judged on its merits.\" <br>Asaam (Rahmatullah alaih) asked him, \"Since when <br>have you been offering such salaat?\" Haatim (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) replied, \"I have been doing it for the last thirty <br>years.\" Asaam (Rahmatullah alaihi wept and said, \"I have <br>never been so fortunate as to offer a single salaat of this <br>kind.\" <br>It is said that Haatim (Rahmatullah alaih) once missed <br>his salaat with jamaat and felt for it too much. A couple of <br>persons came to condole with him on this loss. He started <br>weeping and then said, \"If I had lost one of my sons, half <br>the population of Balkh town would have come to me for <br>condolence, but on the loss of my jamaat you are the only <br>people condoling with me. It is only because people regard <br>the afflictions in the Hereafter as lighter than the affliction <br>of this world.\" <br>Sa'eed bin Musayyab (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"For <br><br>Part III (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>the last twenty years, I have never been out of the musjid at <br>the time of the Azaan.\" <br>Muhammad bin Waasi' (Radmatullah alaih) says, \"I <br>love three things in this life; a friend who could warn me <br>on my slips, bread sufficient to keep me alive, and salaat <br>(with jamaat) such that Allah may condone its defects and <br>give me reward for anything good in it. <br>Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah bin Jarraah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>was once leading the salaat. When the salaat was over, he <br>said to the people, \"Satan made a dangerous attack on me <br>while I was leading the salaat. He made me think that as I <br>was leading salaat, I am the best of all of you. I shall never <br>lead the salaat again.\" <br>Maimoon bin Mahraan (Rahmatullah alaih) once <br>reached the musjid when the jamaat was over. He recited <br>'Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilaihi raaji-oon' and said, ''The <br>reward of this saiaat with jamaat was dearer to me than <br>sovereignty over Iraq.\" <br>It is said of the Companions that they would mourn for <br>three days if they happened to miss the first takbeer and for <br>seven days if they missed jamaat. <br>Bakr bin Abdullah once said, \"You can speak to your <br>Lord and Master any time you like.\" \"How?\" inquired <br>somebody. He replied, \"Perform your wudhu properly and <br>stand up for salaat.\" <br>Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says, \"The Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would be among us (family <br>members) talking and listening, but on approach of salaat <br>hour, he would all of a sudden behave as if he had never <br>known us and would be completely absorbed in Allah. . <br>It is said of Sa'eed Tannookhi (Rahmatullah alaih) that, <br>as long as he remained in salaat, tears would flow from his <br>eyes incessantly. <br>Somebody asked Khalaf bin Ayyoob (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), \"Do not the flies annoy you in your salaat?\" His <br>answer was: \"Even the bad characters in society patiently <br>bear the lashes of the police to boast of their endurance <br>afterwards. Why should I be disturbed by mere flies, while <br>standing in the presence of my Creator?\" <br>It is said in 'Bahjatun nufoos' that one of the Sahabah <br>was once offering Tahajjud when a thief came and took <br>away his horse. He noticed it, but he did not break his <br>salaat. Somebody asked him, \"Why did 'you not break <br>silaat and catch the thief?\" He replied, \"I was engaged in <br>something far r o r e  valuable than the horse.\" <br><br>--- <br>- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is said about Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that whenever <br>an arrow got stuck into his body (in a battle), this was <br>drawn out during his salaat. Once he got an arrow stuck <br>into his thigh. This could not be extracted, in spite of sev- <br>eral efforts, due to severe pain felt by him. When he was <br>busy in his nafl salaat and prostrate in sajdah, the people <br>drew out the arrow with force. When he finished his salaat, <br>he asked the people who had collected around him, \"Have <br>you gathered to take out the arrow?\" When they told him <br>that it was already taken out, he informed them that he had <br>no feelin of pain during the extraction. <br>~ u s f i mbin Yasaar (Rahmatullah alaih), when he stood <br>up for salaat, said to his family members, \"You may keep <br>on talking; I shall not be aware of what you talk.\" <br>It is said of Aamir bin Abdullah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>that he would not even hear the beating of a drum while in <br>salaat, nor to speak of the talk of people around him. A <br>person asked him, \"Are you conscious of anything while in <br>salaat?\" He replied, \"Yes, I am conscious of the fact that I <br>have to stand one day before Allah, whence I shall either <br>be sent to Paradise or Hell.\" The person said, \"No, I do not <br>mean that. Do you come to know of anything we talk <br>around you?\" He replied, \"It is better that spears pass <br>through my body rather than I grow conscious of your con- <br>versation while I am in salaat.\" He used to say, \"My con- <br>viction in the things of the Hereafter is so perfect that it is <br>impossible for it to improve, even if I happen to see those <br>things with my physical eves.\" <br>A pious man was asked, \"Do you ever think of this <br>world while you are in salaat?\" He replied, \"I never think <br>of this world, either in salaat or out of it.\" Another such <br>man was asked, \"Do you think of anything while in <br>salaat?\" He replied, \"Is there anything more attractive than <br>salaat itself to ihink of?\" <br>In 'Bahiatun Nufoos' it is written about a Shaikh that he <br>had eith& been offering fardh or nafl salaat or been ab- <br>sorbed in Zikr without break, right from Zuhr to Fajr of the <br>next day. After Fajr, while continuing Zih, he was over- <br>owe red bv slumber, when immediately he recited Istigh- <br>!aar and the following prayer: <br>\"I seek refuge in Allah from the eye that does not get <br>satiated with sleep.\" <br>Part 111 (c)-Quotations from Ahadith <br>It is said about another Shaikh that he would go to bed <br>and try to sleep. But when he failed in his attempt, he <br>would rise up and engage himself in salaat and would say, <br>\"0Allah! Thou knowest very well that it is the fear of the <br>Fire of Hell that has caused my sleep to disappear.'' <br>There are so many stories about the pious people <br>spending their nights praying in eagerness and love for <br>Allah that these cannot possibly be covered in one book. <br>We have in fact lost the taste for the pleasures of such pur- <br>suits so much that we have begun to doubt the veracity of <br>such facts. But these have been related so frequently and <br>3 -<br>continuously that if we doubt them we can as well doubt <br>history, for frequency and continuity in narration about an <br>e m  <br>event vouch safe its correctness without dispute. <br>Again we see with our own eyes people spending the <br>whole night (sometimes even standing) for witnessing a <br>show in a cinema or a theatre. They neither get tired nor <br>does sleep overpower them. When such impious deeds, if <br>indulged in, have such an attraction, then what makes us <br>doubt that the spiritual pursuits can be so attractive and <br>tasteful, while persons partaking in them are spedally en- <br>dowed with additional strength and endurance by Allah? <br>The only reason for our doubt is our ignorance, which is <br>like that of an immature child about the experiences of pu- <br>berty. May Allah enable us to attain the heights where we <br>may be able to taste the pleasures of His worship. <br>AN IMPORTANT NOTE <br>According to the Soofia, salaat is in fact a supplication <br>to and speech with Allah, and therefore needs thorough <br>concentration, In case of other observances, we need not be <br>so attentive. For example, the essence of Zakaat is to spend <br>money for the pleasure of Allah. Spending, in itself is so <br>hard on a person that even if he does it inattentively he <br>would feel the pinch of it. Similarly, fasting reciuires giving <br>up eating and drinking and sexual satisfaction. All these re- <br>strictions are realjy very hard, even if not observed by <br>proper attention and devotion. On the other hand, Zikr and <br>recitation of the Qur'an are the chief constituents of Salaat. <br>If these are not done intelligently and attentively, they can <br>make neither supplication nor speech. They are just like <br>the ravings of a person in high fever. which do not require <br>any conscious effort nor carry any meaning for the listener. <br>It is therefore necessary that we should be completely at- <br>i <br>Virtues <br>tentive when in salaat, otherw<br>talk of a person in his sleep, <br>the listeners, nor any benefit<br>way, Allah pays no heed to a <br>vely and without concentrat<br>not up to the mark, as comp<br>people in the past, we should<br>absolutely incorrect to think <br>salaat unless it is perfect. To <br>better than to give it up com<br>punishments of a very drast<br>school of Ulama have declar<br>who intentionally discards s<br>Chapter I). <br>It is therefore imperative<br>and genuine efforts to do jus<br>Allah to grant us the ability t<br>the eminent people in the pas<br>one salaat of that nature to<br>before Allah. <br>In the end, it may be p<br>theen are rather liberal in acc<br>ahaadith relating to the rew<br>servances. Ad for the stories a<br>these are a part of ordinary h<br>ferent footing. <br><br>of Salaat <br>wise our salaat will be like the <br>which carries no meaning for <br>t accrues from it. In the same <br>salaat that is offered inattenti- <br>tion. But even if our salaat is <br>pared with that of the eminent <br>d not give up the practice.

This move- <br>= <br>8 5 <br>KI <br>12 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ment is well known and needs no introduction. Its good re- <br>sults soon began to be visible in India and abroad <br>generally, but especially so in the region of Mewat, as is <br>well-known. The fundamental principles of this movement <br>are basically very sound, good and strong, and are inhe- <br>rently fruitful and bedicial. One 'of the important prin- <br>ciples is that those who are engaged in Tableegh work <br>should be particular in practising zikr, and more so when <br>they are actually busy in Tabligh work. After observing the <br>wonderful results of this practice, I myself felt the neces- <br>sity of writing this booklet. I was also ordered by my re- <br>spected uncle that the virtues of zikr of Allah should be <br>compiled and made available to them, so that those who so <br>far practise it out of obedience to Allah may themselves <br>feel an urge for doing so for the sake of its virtues, and <br>thereby realise that zikr is a great wealth. <br>It is neither possible for a humble person like myself to <br>compile a comprehensive treatise on the virtues of zikr, nor <br>is it humanly possible to do full justice to this subject. I <br>have however briefly described some narrations relating to <br>this subject. I have divided the book into three chapters, of <br>which the virtues of zikr in general are described in the <br>first chapter, those of Kalimah Tayyibah in the second and <br>those of the third Kalimah (known as Tasbeeh-Fatimah) in <br>the third. <br>CHAPTER I <br>VIRTUES OF ZIKR IN GENERAL <br>Even if there were no ayat or hadith relating to zikr, we <br>should not have forgotten to remember our real Benefactor, <br>Whose blessings and favours on us at all times are unlimi- <br>ted, and have no parallel. It is but natural that we should <br>remember our Benefactor, perform His zikr (remember <br>Him) and thank Him. Countless virtues of zikr are de-<br>scribed in the Qur'an and.Ahaadith, and the sayings and <br>deeds of our elders in support thereof are available for our <br>benefit. No doubt, the blessings of the glorious zikr of Allah <br>are unlimited and its effulgence is so sublime. <br>Here, I first describe a few ayaat (Verses from the Holy <br>Qur'an) and then some ahaadith on the subject of His <br>glorious zikr. <br>SECTION 1 <br>QuranicVerses relating Zikr <br>8 s4 <br>E N  <br>1.Therefore remember Me, I will remember you.

And when ye have completed your Hajj rites, then <br>remember Allah as ye remember your fathers, or with a <br>more lively remembrance. There are men who say, \"Our <br>Creator!

Allah is swift at reckon- <br>ing. <br>It is related in a hadith that the du'aa of three persons <br>is not rejected rather it is surely accepted.

Allah hath <br>promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, <br>forgiveness and immense reward. <br>COMMENTARY <br>In these verses though the emphasis obviously is on <br>the blessings occurrirlg from ruku, sujood and salaat but <br>there is also an indication about the blessings associated <br>with the second part of the Kalimah viz. (Muhammadur <br>Rasulullah). <br>Imam Raazi (Rahmatullah alaih) has related that in the <br>treaty of Hudaibiyah, on the refusal and insistence of the <br>unbeliever not to write 'Muhammad Rasulullah' and to <br>substitute it by 'Muhammad bin Abdullah', Allah Ta'aalaa <br>asserts that He himself bears testimony to the Prophethood <br>of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). When the <br>Sender confirms personally about a particular person to be <br>His messenger, then the non-acceptance by any number of <br>people does not matter. To confirm this testimony, Allah <br>Ta'aalaa made the statement 'Muhammadur Rasulullah' <br>(Muhammad is a Prophet of Allah). <br>There are other important subjects in these verses. One <br>of them relates to the glow on the face of a blessed person. <br>It has been explained that a person who keeps a vigil at <br>night for prayers develops such a glow on his face. Imaam <br>Raazi (Rahmatullah alaih) considers it an established fact <br>that if two persorls keep awake at night, one spending it in <br>sensual and idle pleasures and the other uses his time in <br>reciting the Qur'an, learning religious knowledge and offer- <br>ing pravers, thev will get up with different facial express- <br>ions the next morning. The latter described above will be <br>because of his spiritual glow, will show himself quite a dif-<br>ferent person. <br><br>The third important thing is that Imaam Maalik (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) and a group of scholars established kufr for <br>those people who talk ill of the Sahaba and bear hatred <br>against them. <br>45.

And when the (Friday) prayer is ended, then dis- <br>perse in the land and seek of Allah's bounty, (with the per- <br>mission to engage yourself in worldly pursuits but even <br>then) and remember Allah much, that ye may be success- <br>ful. <br>48. 0 ye who believe!

He is successful who purifieth himself (of evil <br>manners) and remembereth the name of his Lord, so <br>prayeth. <br><br>Chapter 1 <br>SECTION 2 <br>AHAADITH ON ZIKR <br>(REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH) <br>When the importance of zikr has been emphasised in <br>so many verses of the Holy Qur'an, the number of ahaadith <br>on this subject is naturally far too great; it is in proportion <br>to the many voluminous books of ahaadith. The Holy <br>Qur'an is one book of only 30 parts, but the books of ahaa- <br>dith are many and each book contains a large number of <br>ahaadith. For example, Bukhari Shareef alone consists of <br>30 voluminous parts, and similarly Abu Dawood Shareef <br>has 32 parts. There is no book of ahaadith which does not <br>contain several ahaadith on the subject of zikr, and it is, <br>therefore impossible to quote all such ahaadith in this <br>small booklet. Of course, a single verse of the Holy Qur'an <br>or a hadith moves the faithful-to good actions, but volumes <br>of books would not move an unwilling person, who is like <br>an ass carrying a load of books. <br>Hadith No 2 7 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Almighty Allah says, 'I treat my slave (man) accord- <br>ing to his expectations from Me, and I am with him <br>when he remembers Me, If he remembers Me in his <br>heart, I remember him in My heart; if he remembers <br>Me in a gathering, I remember him in a better and <br>nobler gathering (i.e. of angels). If he comes closer to <br>Me by one span, I go towards him a cubit's length, if he <br>comes towards Me by a cubit's length, I go towards <br>him an arm's length, and if he walks towards Me, I run <br>unto him.\" <br>Note: There are several points elaborated in this <br>hadith. The first point is that Allah deals with a man <br>according to his expectations from Him. One should there- .s <br>fore always be hopeful of the mercy and benevolence of <br>9;<br>Almighty Allah and never be despondent of His blessings. <br>y N <br>Certainly, we are extremely sinful and justly deserve pun- <br>ishment on account of our evil deeds, yet in no case should <br>we feel despondent of the mercy of Allah, as He may per- <br>haps totally forgive us. <br>\"Lo! Allah forgiveth not if a artner be ascribed unto <br>Him and forgiveth all save that to w \\om He will.\" <br>But Almighty Allah may or map ,not forgive; that is <br>why the Ulama say that true belief lies in between hope (of <br>forgiveness of Allah) and fear (of His wrath). The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once visited a young <br>Sahabi, who was breathing his last, and asked him how he <br>was feeling. He replied, \"O!Messenger of Allah, I am hope- <br>ful of the mercy of Allah, and yet I am afraid of my sins.\" <br>Thereupon the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said \"When the heart of a believer is filled with these two <br>feelings of hope and fear, Almighty Allah fulfils his hope <br>and saves him from what he is afraid of.\" <br>It is mentioned in one hadith that a believer thinks of <br>his sin, as if he is sitting under a huge rock that is threaten- <br>ing to fall on him, while for a transgressor his sin is no <br>more than a fly which is easily scared off, i.e., he takes his <br>sins very lightly. In short, one should be appropriately <br>afraid of ones sins, and at the same time remain hopeful of <br>Allah's mercy. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyallaho anho) died of the <br>plague and, in the moments of death's agony, he fainted <br>many times. Whenever he regained consciousness for a <br>moment, he would say, \"Oh Allah! Thou knowest that I <br>love Thee. By Thy Honour and Glory, Thou knowest this <br>very well.\" Just before breathing his last, he said, \"0Death, <br>you are a welcome guest but have come at a time when <br>there is nothing in the .house to eat.\" Then he said, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou knowest very well that I always feared Thee, <br>and today I die hopeful of Thy forgiveness. 0 Allah! I en- <br>joyed life, not in digging canals and planting gardens, but <br>in remaining thirsty in the hot weather, in undergoing <br>hardships for the sake of Islaam, and in taking part in the <br>gatherings engaged in zikr under the supervision of the <br>lama.\" <br>Some Ulama have written that the fulfilment of expec- <br>tations promised by Almighty Allah in the aforesaid hadith <br>is in its most general sense. It carries assurance not only in <br>respect of forgiveness but also in respect of prayers, health, <br>wealth and safety. For instance when a person prays to <br>Allah and sincerely believes that Allah shall accept his <br>prayer, then his prayer is actually accepted, but if he has <br>doubt (that his prayer would not be accepted), it is not ac- <br>cepted. Thus, in another hadith it is stated that the prayer <br>of a person is granted so long as he does not say that his <br>prayer is not granted. The same is true in the case of all <br>blessings relating to health, prosperity, etc. According to <br>one hadith, if a destitute perssn discloses his hunger to <br>everybody, he is not relieved of his poverty, but if ,he <br>shows submission to Gracious Allah, his condition may <br>soon change for the better. However, hoping for the better <br>from Almighty Allah is one thing, and being over-confident <br>of His help and forgiveness is another thing. Almighty <br>Allah has warned us against such an attitude in several <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an e.g. <br>ij$\\ .A4.$3 yj <br>\"Let not the deceiver (the Satan) beguile you in regard <br>to Allah\" i.e. one should not be misled by the devil to <br>commit sins just because Allah is the most Merciful <br>and the Forgiver\". <br>There is another verse, <br>* , * + J , * I ; J + ~ \\ $  <br><br>Ch. 1: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>\"Hath he knowledge of the Unseen, or hath he made a <br>pact with the Beneficent. No, never.\" <br>The second point in this hadith is \"Whenever a slave <br>of mine remembers Me, I am with him.\" In another hadith, <br>it is stated, \"So long as one's lips move in My remem- <br>brance I remain with him\" i.e. Almighty Allah bestows His <br>special care and mercy on him during all this time. <br>The third point is that Almighty Allah mentions him <br>with a favour to the angels, which signifies the value of <br>zikr. Firstly, this is because Allah created man such that in- <br>herently he is liable to be good as well as to go astray, as <br>given below in Hadith No. 8. Submission on his part there- <br>fore deserves special appreciation. Secondly, at the time of <br>Aadam's creation, the Angels (who have no instinct for <br>doing evil) could not understand the creation of man and <br>had contended that he would cause blood-shed and trouble <br>+<br>O <br>in the world, while they are always there to praise and <br>glorify Almighty Allah. Thirdly, man's worship of Allah 13 <br>and submission to His will is more commendable than that <br>of the Angels, because he does so on account of his faith in <br>the unseen which, however, is actually seen by the angels. <br>It is to this fact that Allah refers in the Holy Book: \"How <br>would man not have worshipped if he had actually seen <br>the Paradise and the Hell.\" It is for this reason that <br>Almighty Allah praises the noble deeds of those who <br>worship and glorify Him without seeing Him. <br>The fourth point contained in the above-mentioned <br>hadith is that if a man increases his devotion to Almighty <br>Allah, the increase in His mercy and kindness upon him is <br>proportionately far greater. \"Getting near\" and \"running\" <br>signify immediate increase in His blessings and mercy. <br>Thus, it is upto a person that, if he wants to enjoy more <br>kindness and favours from Almighty Allah, he should in- <br>crease his devotion to Him. <br>The fifth point in the above mentioned hadith is that <br>the Angels have been stated to be superior to man, while it <br>is commonly known that man is the best creation of Allah. <br>One reason for this,has already been explained in the trans- <br>lation (of the hadith), that the angels are superior because <br>they are innocent and are unable to commit sins. Secondly, <br>they are superior because they are better than the majority <br>of men, including even the majority of believers; arid yet <br>some selected Believers like the Prophets (Alaihimus <br>salaam) are superior to the angels. There are other reasons <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>as well, which are however left out in order to prevent the <br>discourse from getting too long. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>A Sahabi once said, \"0,Rasulullah, (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I know that the commandments of Sharee- <br>at am many, but of these tell me the one that I may <br>practise assiduously throughout my life.\" The Prophet, <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), replied, \"Keep ydUr <br>tongue always moist (i.e. busy) with the zikr of Allah.\" <br>According to another hadith, Harat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has said, \"Once at the time of my departure <br>from Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), I asked <br>him to advise me of that action which is most pleasing <br>to Almighty Allah: whereupon he replied, \"At the time <br>I <br>of your death, your tongue should be busy with zikr of <br>Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: By \"my departure\", Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) refers to the occasion when he was appointed <br>by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as the <br>Governor of Yemen and sent there for teaching and propa- <br>gating Islaam. It was at the time of that farewell that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given him some <br>parting instructions. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>By saying that \"the commandments of Sharee-at are <br>many\", the Sahabi had meant that although observance of <br>every commandment is imperative, to specialize and attain <br>perfection in each and every one is difficult; and so he <br>wanted that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), may <br>recommend him something of over-riding importance <br>which he might hold fast to, and practise at all times and in <br>all conditions of sitting, standing or walking. <br>According to another hadith, a person who pos- <br>sesses the following four things is truly blessed, from <br>the worldly as well as spiritual point of view:- <br>(i) A tongue ever absorbed in the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah. <br>(ii) A heart filled with gratitude of Allah. <br>(iii) A body capable of undergoing hardships. <br>(iv) A wife who does not betray her husband's trust in <br>respect of her chastity and his wealth. <br>The phrase \"moist tongue\" according to some Ulama <br>means excessive utterance (of zikr) and, idiomatically, it is <br>used to convey excessive glorification and praise. But in <br>my (the author's) humble opinian it can have another <br>meaning as well. It is always very sweet and pleasant to <br>talk of one's beloved, as is the common feeling and experi- <br>ence of every lover. On this basis, the phrase \"moist <br>tongue\" would, therefore mean that one should glorify <br>with love the name of Almighty Allah, so as to feel love's <br>sweetness in the mouth. I have observed many times that <br>when some of my religious elders do zikr aloud, the flavour <br>of the sweetness enjoyed by them is so transmitted to the <br>listeners that their mouths also feel the sweetness and they <br>share the ecstasy likewise. But this phenomenon is poss- <br>ible only where there is a genuine yearning for zikr, and <br>the tongue is accustomed to excessive zikr. It is stated in <br>one hadith that the proof of one's love for Almighty Allah <br>lies in one's love for the zikr of Allah, and in the same way <br>lack of zikr betrays lack of attachment with Almighty <br>Allah. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) said that <br>those who keep their tongues wet with the zikr of Allah, <br>will snter paradise smiling. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>HadithNo. 3 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to <br>his companions, \"Shall I tell you of something that is <br>the best of all deeds, constitutes the best act of piety in <br>the eyes of your Lord, will elevate your status in the <br>Hereafter, and carries more virtue than the spending of <br>gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in <br>jihaad arid slayin or being slain in the path of Allah.\" <br>The Com anions egged to be informed of such an act. <br>The Prop Ret (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is <br>the zikr of Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: This hadith is a generalized statement; other- <br>wise, at times of specific need and emergency sadaqah <br>(charity) and jihaad (fighting in the path of Allah), etc., <br>become more desirable, as stated in some other ahaadith. <br>These acts become more important during the hour of <br>need, but the zikr is for all times and therefore generally <br>more important and virtuous. <br>According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said, \"for everything <br>there is a purifier or cleanser. (For instance, soap is used <br>for cleaning the body and the clothes, while a furnace is <br>used for purifying iron). The zikr of Almighty Allah <br>cleanses and purifies the heart, and provides the best pro- <br>tection against retribution in the Hereafter.\" This hadith <br>describes zikr as the purifier of the heart, and as such it <br>also established superiority of zikr over all other actions, <br><br>because the value of every act of worship depends upon <br>ikhlaas (sincerity of the intention), which in turn depends <br>on the purity of heart. Therefore, according to some Sufis, <br>the zikr in this hadith implies the zikr of the heart as <br>against the zikr by the tongue. By the zikr of the heart, they <br>mean that the heart remains always conscious of, and in <br>communication with Almighty Allah. This state of the <br>heart is doubtless superior to all kinds of worship, because <br>when this state is attained, then omission of any kind of <br>worship is just not possible. All parts of the human body, <br>internal and external, are controlled by the heart and <br>submit completely to the Being to Whom the heart is at- <br>tached. The conduct of true lovers bears ample testimony <br>to this fact. <br>There are many more ahaadith that describe the <br>superiority of zikr over all other actions. Somebody en- <br>quired of Hazrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) as to what <br>action of man is most virtuous. He replied, \"Have you not <br>read in the Holy Qur'an, <br>(certainly the zikr of Allah is most exalted)?\" <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) had referred <br>here to the first ayat of Part 21 of the Holy Qur'an. The <br>author of \"Majaalisul Abraar\", while commenting on this <br>Hadith, has written that zikr of Allah is described to be su- <br>perior to sadaqah, jihaad, and all forms of worship, because <br>it is an end in itself, and ail types of worship constitute <br>only a means to achieve this end. zikr is of two kinds: one <br>is done by word of mouth and the other is in the form of <br>deep meditation and contemplation. It is the latter form of <br>zikr that is implied in the hadith which states that medita- <br>tion for one moment is better than doing worship for se- <br>venty years. Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) reported <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The <br>reward of the zikr of Allah is seven hundred thousand <br>times more than that for spending wealth in the path of <br>Allah.\" <br>Thus, in conclusion, it is evident that jihaad and sada- <br>qah, etc., assume more importance and become more virtu- <br>ous due to the need of the hour. The ahaadith which <br>describe their superiority are therefore understandable. For <br>instance, it is stated in one hadith that standing up for a <br>short while in the path of Allah is more valuable than offer- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ing salaat at home for seventy years. Although salaat is <br>unanimously admitted to be the best form of worship, yet <br>taking part in jihaad at the time of an invasion by the infi- <br>dels carries far greater reward. <br>Hadith No.4 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), said, \"There <br>are many a people who do zikr of .Almighty Allah, <br>while lying comfortably in their soft beds, and for this, <br>they will be rewarded with the highest positions in <br>Paradise by Almighty Lord.\" <br>Note: ~ b n e r a l ~ ~ ,  <br>the greater the sufferings and hard- <br>ships one undergoes in the cause of religion, the higher <br>will be his status in the Hereafter. But the zikr of Allah is <br>such a blessed act that, even if it is done in soft beds in this <br>world, it will bring high rewards and elevated positions in <br>the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said, \"If you keep yourselves busy in zikr all the time, the <br>angels will shake hands with you in your beds as well as <br>on your way.\" <br>, <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"The mufarrideen have gone far ahead.\" \"Who are the mu- <br>farrideen?\" enquired the Sahabah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Those who are intensely de- <br>voted to the zikr of Allah.\" On the basis of this hadith, the <br>Sufis have stated that the kings and rulers should not be <br>prevented from zikr of Allah, for they, by this means, can <br>attain a lofty rank in the Hereafter. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Glorify <br>Almighty Allah during the time of prosperity and happi- <br>ness, and it will help you in times of distress and trouble \" <br>-<br>1-ladhrat Salmaan Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If a <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>person remembers Allah in times of peace, pleasure and <br>prosperity, then whenever he is in trouble and difficulty, <br>the angels, being familiar with his voice, recognise him in <br>his helplessness and intercede before Almighty Allah (for <br>his forgiveness); but, if one who does not remember Allah <br>in his time of pleasure and happens to pray for help at the <br>time of difficulty, the angels find his voice to be quite un- <br>familiar and therefore do not intercede for him.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"Para- <br>dise has eight gates, one of which is exclusively reserved <br>for those who are engaged in zikr.\" It is said in one hadith, <br>\"A person who constantly does zikr of Allah is immune <br>from hypocrisy in faith\", and according to another hadith, <br>\"He is loved by Almighty Allah.\" <br>Once during his return journey to Madina Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Where are those who <br>have gone ahead.\" The Companions said, \"The fast travel- <br>g & <br>lers have gone ahead\": then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe 8<br>wasallam) said, \"Those who remain ahead are the persons <br>who remain constantly absorbed in zikr. Whoever desires <br>to enjoy himself in Paradise, should do zikr of Allah ex- <br>cessively.\" <br>Hadith No 5 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The <br>contrast between a person who glorifies Almighty <br>Allah and one who does not remember Him is like that <br>between the living and the dead.\" <br>Note: <br>Life is dear to all, and every one fears death. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) meant to say that one <br>who does not remember Allah, though bodily alive, is <br>spiritually dead and his life is but worthless. A Persian <br>couplet quoted here by the author means, <br>\"(The lover says) My life (of loneliness) is no life; his is the <br>life who lives in contact with the beloved.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that the example refers to the <br>condition of the heart: the heart that remembers Allah is <br>really alive, while the one that does not, is described as <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i <br>dead. Some scholars say that the contrast is in respect of <br>gain and loss. A man who harasses a zaakir is like one har- <br>assing a living being, and he will be avenged for this har- <br>assment and will suffer for it. One who ill-treats the <br>neglectful, ill-treats a dead body, which cannot avenge <br>itself. Some Sufis say that the hadith refers to the eternal <br>life of the zaakireen, because those who glorify Allah con- <br>stantly with sincerity never really die, but instead remain <br>spiritually alive even after passing away from this world. <br>The zaakireen also enjoy a special life after death, like the <br>martyrs, mentioned in a verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Nay, they are alive in the eyes of their Sustainer. <br>Hakiem Tirmizi writes, \"Zikr moistens the heart and <br>softens it. A heart that is devoid of zikr becomes dry and <br>hard, due to the excessive heat of lust and base desires. All <br>parts of the body likewise become stiff and abstain from <br>submission to Allah; if you try to bend them, they break <br>like a dry piece of wood, which can be used as firewood <br>only. <br>Hadith No. 6 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"If a person has a lot of wealth and distrib- <br>utes it amongst the needy, while another person is <br>only busy with the zikr of Allah, the latter, who is en- <br>gaged in zikr, is the better of the two.\" <br>Note: <br>Spending in the path of Allah is a splendid virtue, but <br>zikr of Allah is more virtuous. How lucky are those well-to- <br>do persons who, in addition to spending for the pleasure of <br>Allah, remain also devoted to His zikr. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>According to one hadith, Almighty Allah also gives sa- <br>daqah every day, i.e. He showers His favours on the eople, <br>and everybody gets what he deserves, but the luc Eiest is <br>the person who is favoured with the ability to do His zikr. <br>People who are engaged in different occupations, such as <br>trade, farming and service, should spare some time for zikr <br>every day and thereby earn great rewards. It should not be <br>difficult to devote an hour or two out of 24 hours, exclus- <br>ively for this noble purpose. <br>A lot of our time is wasted in frivolous pursuits, and <br>some of this can be easily spared for this most useful work. <br>In another hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"The wisest of all people are <br>those who keep track of time, with the help of the sun, the <br>moon, the stars, and the shadows, for doing zikr regularly.\" <br>Nowadays we can determine time with the help of <br>* <br>watches, yet one should be able to judge time with the help <br>of these natural agents, so that no time gets wasted in case <br>the watch stops or goes out of order. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the place where zikr is done, takes pride over <br>other parts of the earth. <br>Hadith No. 7 <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Those who are admitted into Paradise will not regret <br>over anything of this world, except the time spent <br>without zikr in their life.\" <br>Note: <br>After their entry into Paradise, when they will see the <br>huge reward (as large as mountains) for remembering Allah <br>once, they will feel extremely sorry over their loss caused <br>by the time spent without zikr, as can be well imagined. In <br>this world, there are such blessed persons who would not <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>relish this life it is were spent without the zikr of Allah. <br>Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah aiaih) writes in his book <br>\"Munabbihaat\" that Yahya bin Mu'aaz Raazi (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) used to say in his supplication: <br>0 Allah! the nigl.. is no good unless spent in com- <br>munion with You, the day is no good unless spent in <br>worshipping You, this life is no good without Your zikr, <br>the next life will be no good without forgiveness from You, <br>and Paradise will not be enjoyable without beholding You. <br>Hadhrat Sirri (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"I saw Jurjani <br>swallowing roasted barley flour. He told me that he had <br>compared the time taken in chewing bread and in eating <br>barley flour: eating bread took so much longer that he <br>could say <br>h<br>i <br>seventy times in that time. There- <br>fore, he had not taken bread for forty years, and had lived <br>by swallowing barley flour alone.\" <br>It is said about Mansoor bin Mu'tamar that he never <br>spoke to anybody after Ishaa prayers for forty years. Simi- <br>larly, it is said about Rabee' bin Hatheem that it was his <br>practice for twenty years that he noted down what he <br>talked during the day, and would check at night whether <br>that talking was necessary or not. Those pious scholars <br>were particular that every moment of their life was spent in <br>zikr and in nothing else. <br>Hadith No 8 <br>I <br><br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) both bore testi- <br>mony to having heard from Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), that the gathering engaged in zikr of <br>Almighty Allah is surrounded by the angels on all <br>sides, the grace of Allah and sakeenah (peace and tran- <br>quility) descend upon them, and Almighty Allah <br>speaks about them, by way of appreciation, to His <br>angels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) related that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said to him, \"I <br>advise you to fear Allah, as this is the root of all virtues; <br>remain engaged in the recitation of Holy Qur'an and in zikr <br>of Almighty Allah, which will earn you an appreciation in <br>the Heavens and serve you as a light in this world; keep <br>silent for most of the time, so that you speak nothing but <br>good, as this will keep the Devil away from you and make <br>%+<br>E N<br>it easy for you to perform your religious duties, abstain also <br>$<br>from too much laughing, for laughing weakens the heart <br>and deprives the face of its spiritual glow (luminosity), <br>always take part in jihaad as this is the sign of piety for my <br>ummah; like the poor and keep their company; compare <br>your lot with persons lower than you, and never look upto <br>those higher than you, otherwise you will forget the boun- <br>ties of Almightv Allah and become ungrateful to Him; try <br>to retain ties with your relatives though they may try to <br>break them; do not hesitate to speak out the truth, though it <br>may be bitter for others: always obey Almighty Allah in <br>spite of adverse criticism, find fault with your own self, <br>and never with others; do not criticise others for the short- <br>comings that you suffer from. O! Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) there is no wisdom better than farsightedness, absti- <br>nence from the unlawful is the best act of piety, and good <br>manners constitute true nobility.\" <br>Note: <br>The word 'sakeenah' according to various scholars <br>means tranquility and peace, as well as Allah's special <br>mercy, as explained in detail in my book Fazaa'il-i-Qur'an. <br>I:or instance, Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) states that <br>sakeenah is a special favour consisting of tranquility, <br>mercy, etc. and is brought down from the Heavens by the <br>angels. <br>This appreciation, in the presence of the angels, by <br>Almighty Allah for those engaged in zikr is for two reasons. <br><br>Firstly, it is because the angels (as mentioned under the <br>first hadith) had submitted, at the time of the creation of <br>Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam), that man would commit <br>mischief in the world. Secondly, it is because the Angels <br>are ever engaged in prayers, submission, and obedience to <br>Almighty Allah, and are devoid of the very instinct for sin, <br>whereas man has the instinct of obedience as well as of sin <br>and (in addition) he is surrounded by things that lead him <br>to negligence and disobedience, and has desires and lust <br>ingrained in him. Therefore, prayers, submission and absti- <br>nence from sin, despite all his handicaps, are more praise- <br>worthy and creditable on his part. <br>In one hadith, it is stated that, when Allah created <br>Paradise, he told the angel Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to go <br>and visit it. On his return from Paradise, he reported, \"0 <br>Lord! by Your Greatness, whoever comes to know of it, will <br>do his best to enter it\", that is to say, its pleasures, com- <br>forts, enjoyments and blessings are so intense that there <br>will be no body who, after knowing and believing these, <br>will not strive his utmost for admission into it. Almighty <br>Allah then surrounded Paradise with hardships and made <br>it compulsory to offer prayers, observe fasting, take part in <br>jihaad, go for Haj, etc., for admission into it. Almighty <br>Allah then sent Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to visit it again. <br>He saw these and then said, \"0 Allah! I fear that hardly <br>anybody will be able to enter it.\" Similarly, after creating <br>Hell, Almighty Allah ordered Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to <br>visit it. After witnessing the punishments, horrors, afflic- <br>tions and tortures of Hell, he submitted, \"I swear by Thy <br>Grandeur that one who comes to know of the conditions in <br>Hell will never dare go near it.\" Then Allah surrounded <br>Hell with acts of indulgence, such as adultery, drinking <br>wine, cruelty, disregard of the Divine commandments, etc., <br>and then asked Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to visit it again. <br>He saw it and submitted. \"My Lord! I fear that hardly any- <br>body will be able to escape it.\" It is for this reason that, <br>when a person obeys Almighty Allah and abstains from <br>sins, he becomes praiseworthy with respect to his environ- <br>ments, and therefore Almighty Allah expresses His pleas- <br>ure about him. The angels mentioned in this hadith and in <br>so many other similar ahaadith belong to a special group <br>who are dutv-bound to visit the places and attend the meet- <br>ings where people are engaged in zikr. This is supported by <br>another hadith wherein it is stated that there is a class of <br>angels who are scattered all over, and when and wherever <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>i <br>i<br>any one of them hears zikr being recited he calls all his <br>companions to come to that place, and partake of what they <br>wanted. They throng to the place and they fill it up to the <br>sky, as mentioned in Chapter I1 under item 14. <br>Hadith No.9 <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) went to a <br>group of Sahaba, (Radhiyallaho anhum) and said to <br>them, \"What for are you sitting here?\" They replied, <br>\"We are engaged in the zikr of Almighty Allah, and are <br>glorifying Him for His extreme kindness to us in that <br>He has blessed us with the wealth of Islaam.\" Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"By Allah, Are <br>you here only for this reason?\" \"By Allah!\", replied <br>the Sahaba, (Radhiyallaho anhum), \"We are sitting <br>here only for this reason.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) then said, \"I asked you to swear not <br>out of any misunderstanding, but because jibra-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) came to me and informed me just <br>now that Almighty Allah was speaking high about you <br>'before angels.\" <br>Note: Enquiry on oath by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br> <br>sallam) was simply to ascertain whether there was any <br>other special thing, besides zikr, which might be the cause <br>of Allah's pride. It became definite that it was only because <br>of the zikr of Almighty Allah that He was proud of them. <br>How lucky were those people whose worship was ac-<br>cepted, and the news of Allah's recognition of the zikr on <br>their part was revealed to them in this very earthly life <br>through Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Certainly, <br>their sublime deeds deserved all this appreciation. Their <br>heroic deeds are briefly described in my book named <br>Hikaayaat-e- Sahabah, (i.e. The Stories of Sahabah). Mulla <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) interprets the pride on the <br>part of Almighty Allah to mean that He wants the angels to <br>realize, \"Despite the fact these humans are full of tempta- <br>tions, the Devil is after them, desires are inside them, the <br>worldly needs chase them, and yet they are engaged in <br>glorifying Almighty Allah, and so many deterrents cannot <br>prevent them from doing zikr: and therefore your zikr and <br>glorification, in the absence of any such handicaps is com- <br>paratively insignificant.\" <br>Hadith No 10 <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reported that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"When <br>some people assemble for the zikr of Allah with the <br>sole purpose of earning His pleasure, an angel pro- <br>claims from the sky, 'You people have been forgiven, <br>your sins have been replaced by virtues.\" According to <br>another hadith, \"A gathering devoid of zikr of Allah, <br>would be the cause of dismay and sorrow on the Day <br>of Judgement.\" It means that the participants of such a <br>gathering will repent that they earned no blessings and <br>wasted their time for nothing; may be, it led them to af- <br>flictions. In another hadith, it is stated that the mem- <br>bers of a gathering devoid of zikr of Allah and salawaat <br>on Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) are- like <br>those who get up from the dead body of an ass. <br>According to another hadith, one should get the va- <br>riour transgressions (unwittingly) committed in a gath- <br>Ch.I: Ahaadith on Zikr<br>ering condoned by reciting the following prayer at the <br>conclusion of the meeting: <br>\"Glory be to Allah with all kinds of praises. Glory be to <br>Thee, 0 Allah! with all Thy Praise; I stand witness that <br>there is no one to be worshipped except Thee. I seek Thy <br>forgiveness and turn (for mercy) to Thee.\" <br>It is narrated in another hadith that any gathering <br>devoid of Allah's zikr and salawaat will be a source of <br>dismay and loss. Then, out of His sheer mercy, Allah may <br>grant forgiveness, or He may demand an explanation and <br>3 3  <br>penalize. It is stated in another hadith. \"Do proper justice <br>ea <br>to a gathering by remembering Allah profusely, show the <br>way to wayfarers (if need be), and close your eyes or cast <br>them down when you come across a forbidden thing. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Karamallaaho Wajhahoo) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever desires that his reward be weighed on the Day of <br>Judgement in a large scale (i.e. his reward should be very <br>big, as only weighty things, and not the small things, are <br>weighed in big scales), should recite the following prayer at <br>the end of a meeting: <br>(Glory) to Thy Lord-The Lord of Honour And Power. (He <br>is free) from what they ascribe (to Him). And peace be on <br>the apostles, and Praise to Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of <br>the Worlds). <br>The above hadith also includes the happy tidings that <br>the sins will be replaced by virtues. Even in the Holy <br>Qur'an, at the end of surah al-Furqaan, Almighty Allah <br>mentions the good qualities of the believers and then says: <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>As for such. Allah will change their evil deeds to good <br>deeds: and Allah is ever forgiving and most merciful. <br>The following are some comments made by the com- <br>mentators on this verse:- <br>1. All sins would be forgiven and only virtues would <br>remain (in the account); that no sin is left behind <br>(in the account) is itself a big change. <br>2. <br>Almighty Allah will enable them to do good deeds <br>when otherwise they would have committed bad <br>deeds, just as it is sometimes said, \"the heat was <br>replaced by the cold.\" <br>3. Their habits become related to virtues instead of <br>vices, so much so that doing good deeds becomes <br>their habit. Habits once formed become second <br>nature, which does not change. The Persian pro- <br>verb meaning that \"The mountain can move, but <br>not the habit\" refers to this fact. This proverb is <br>also derived from another hadith, \"You may be- <br>lieve if you hear that a mountain has moved from <br>its place, but do not believe if you are told that the <br>habits of somebody have changed.\" This hadith <br>implies that the change of a habit is more unli.kely <br>than a mountain changing its place. The question <br>then arises what is meant when it is said that the <br>Sufis and religious teachers reform the behaviour <br>of their disciples. The answer is that habits do not <br>change, but the relationship of habits changes. For <br>instance, if a man's temperament is such that he! is <br>prone to anger, it is difficult for him to get rid of <br>his hot temperament through the training and <br>excercises under the supervisio~l of the Shaikhs, <br>but they would reform him in such a way that, <br>whereas formerly his anger led him to show un- <br>justified cruelty and haughtiness, it will now be <br>directed against transgression of Allah's com-<br>mandments. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) at <br>one time had left no stone unturned in molesting <br>the Muslims, but after embracing Islaam and re-<br>maining in the company of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) he became correspondingly hard <br>on the unbelievers and transgressors. So is the <br>case with other aspects of one's conduct. This <br>clarification leads us to the conclusion that <br>I <br>\\ <br>I <br>i <br><br>Ch. I:.Ahaadith on Zikr <br>4. <br>Almighty Allah shifts the direction of the conduct <br>of such people from vices to virtues. <br>Almighty Allah guides him to repent for his sins. <br>He recollects his old sins, repents over them and <br>prays for forgiveness. Thus, for every sin pre-<br>viously committed, he gets the credit of one repen- <br>tance, which constitues a devotion and a virtue. <br>5. If Allah is pleased with the good deeds of some- <br>body, and through His sheer benevolence grants <br>him virtues equal to his sins, there is nobody to <br>question His authority. He is the Lord, He is the <br>King, He is All powerful, His mercy is boundless. <br>Who can close the door of His forgiveness? Who <br>can stop His bounty? He gives everything from His <br>own treasures. He will exhibit His powers and un- <br>limited forgiveness on the Day of Judgement. Vari- <br>ous scenes of reckoning on the Day of Judgement <br>are described in ahaadith, as briefly given in the <br>book, Bahjatun Nufoos. It is mentioned that reck- <br>oning will be conducted in different ways. \"Some <br>people will be examined in camera under the <br>cover of (secret) Mercy: their sins will be re-<br>counted to them, they will be reminded of the oc- <br>casion when each sin was committed by them and <br>there will be no alternative for them but to confess <br>all their sins. Due to the abundance of his sins. he <br>will think that he is doomed. but the Lord will <br>say, \"I covered your sins during the worldly life <br>and again I cover them now, and forgive them all.\" <br>When such a person, along with others like him, <br>will return from the place of reckoning, the people <br>will see him and exclaim, \"What a blessed person, <br>he never committed any sin,\" because they will <br>have no knowledge of his sins. Similarly, in an- <br>other mode of reckoning, the people will have <br>minor as well as major sins to their account. Then, <br>Almighty Allah will order that their minor sins <br>may be converted into virtues, at which they (in <br>order to get more virtues) will exclaim that many <br>of their sins are not mentioned in their account. In <br>the same way, the modes of reckoning \"are also <br>mentioned in ahaadith. An anecdote is mentioned <br>in one hadith, wherein Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said. \"I recog-<br>% <br>8.2 <br>gz<br>$ <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>nise the person who will be transferred from the <br>Hell to the Paradise last of all. He will be sum- <br>moned, and the angels will be directed that his <br>major sins should not be mentioned and that only <br>his minor sins should be read out, and he should <br>be asked to give explanation for them. This trial <br>will start, and his sins will be recounted to him <br>with time and place. How can he deny them? He <br>will confess them all. Almighty Allah will then <br>order that for every sin he may be given one <br>virtue. At this, the man will speak out at once, <br>\"There are still many sins that have not been men- <br>tioned so far.\" While narrating this part of the <br>story, even Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) smiled. Firstly, to be the last one to come out <br>of the Hell, as mentioned in this narrative, does <br>not mean a light punishment; secondly, it is not <br>known as to who will be that lucky one whose <br>sins will be converted into virtues. Hoping for the <br>best from Almighty Allah and constantly begging <br>for His mercy constitute the best form of submis- <br>sion. But one should never be over-complacent in <br>this matter. However, the above-mentioned hadith <br>shows that taking part in meetings of zikr with <br>ikhlaas leads to replacement of sins by virtues. But <br>this ikhlaas is possible only through the grace of <br>Almighty Allah. <br>The main point contained in this hadith is that of <br>ikhlaas (i.e. doing a thing only for the pleasure 'of <br>Allah). That ikhlaas is the pre-requisite for all good <br>deeds will be found in several other ahaadith in this <br>book. In fact, the acceptance by Almighty Allah de- <br>pends only on ikhlaas: every deed will be evaluated <br>according to the degree of ikhlaas involved therein. <br>According to the Sufis, ikhlaas on one's part requires <br>i<br>that one's words, thoughts and deeds should be com- <br>patible. It will be found in one hadith that ikhlaas is <br>that which prevents one from committing sin. <br>A story of a despotic king who was notorious for <br>I <br>his tyranny and cruelty is related in the book \"Bahja- <br>tun Nufoos.\" Once. a large consignment of wine was <br>being brought for him in a ship. A pious man who hap- <br>pened to travel by that ship broke all the bottles or <br>I <br>casks of wine except one, but nobody could stop him <br>4 7 <br>from that act. Everybody wondered how he dared to do <br>this, for nobody had the courage to face the cruelty of <br>the king. When the king was informed about it, he was <br>surprised to learn how an ordinary person had the <br>courage to do all that and also wondered why he left <br>one cask intact. The man was called for, and interro- <br>gated. He replied, \"My conscience had urged me to do <br>this; you may punish me as you like.\" He was then <br>asked why one cask was left unbroken? He replied, \"At <br>first I broke the casks of wine out of my religous senti- <br>ments, but when only one was left, my heart felt elated <br>at having done something forbidden by religion. I then <br>felt that breaking this last cask would be for the satis- <br>faction of my ego. I, therefore, did not break it.\" Find- <br>ing him selfless in what he did, the king ordered his -<br>release. <br>o <br>It is narrated in Ihyaa-ul Uloom that there was a <br>B.k2 <br>pious man among the Israelites, who always remained <br>g 3  <br>busy in the worship of Allah. A group of people came <br>to him and told him that a tribe living nearby <br>worshipped a tree. The news upset him, and with an <br>axe on his shou der he went to cut down that tree. On <br>the way, Satan I et him in the form of an old man and <br>asked him where he was going. He said he was going <br>to cut a particular tree. Satan said, \"You are not con- <br>cerned with this tree, you better mind your worship <br>and do not give it up for the sake of something that <br>does not concern you.\" \"This is also worship\", re-<br>torted the worshipper. Then Satan tried to prevent him <br>from cutting the tree, and there followed a bout be- <br>tween the two, in which the worshipper overpowered <br>the Satan. Finding himself completely helpless, Satan <br>begged to be excused, and when the worshipper re- <br>leased him, he again said, \"Allah has not made the cut- <br>ting of this tree obtigatory on you. You do not lose <br>anything if you do not cut it. If its cutting were necess- <br>ary. Allah could have got it done through one of his <br>many Apostles.\" The worshipper insisted on cutting <br>the tree. There was again a bout between the two and <br>again the worshipper overpowered the Satan. \"Well, <br>listen\" said the Satan, \"I propose a settlement that will <br>be to your advantage.\" The worshipper agreed, and the <br>Satan said, \"You are a poor man, a mere burden on <br>this earth. If you desist from this act, I will pay you <br>three gold coins everyday. You will daily find them <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>lying under your pillow. By this money you can fulfil <br>your own needs, can oblige your relatives, help the <br>needy, and do soamany other virtuous things. Cutting <br>the tree will be only one virtue, which will ultimately <br>be of no use because the pebple will grow another <br>tree.\" This proposal appealed to the worshipper, and <br>he accepted it. He found the money on two successive <br>days, but on the third day there was nothing. He got <br>enraged. picked up his axe and went to cut the tree. <br>The old man again met him on the way and asked him <br>where he was going. \"To cut the tree\", shouted the <br>worshipper. \"I will not let you do it\", said the Satan. <br>An encounter ensured between the two, and this time <br>the Satan had the upper-hand and overpowered the <br>worshipper. The latter was surprised at his own defeat, <br>and asked the former the cause of his success. The <br>Satan replied, \"At first, your anger was purely for earn- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and therefore Almighty <br>Allah helped you to overpower me, but now it has <br>been partly for the sake of the gold coins and therefore <br>you lost.\" Truly speaking. a deed performed purely for <br>the pleasure of Allah alone carries great force. <br>Hadith No.11 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"No <br>other action of a person can surpass zikr of Almighty <br>Allah in saving him from the punishment in the <br>grave.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>Note: <br>How serious is the punishment in the rave can be <br>realized only by those who have the knowle fge of hadith <br>on this subject. Whenever Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) visited a grave, he would weep so much that his <br>beard would become wet with tears. Some one asked him, <br>\"How is it that mention of Paradise and Hell does not make <br>you weep so much as you do when you come across a <br>grave?\" He replied, \"The grave is the first of the many <br>stages of the Hereafter. For him who is successful or safe <br>during this stage, the later stages will also be easy; while <br>for a person who is not exempted in this stage, the later <br>stages will be even more difficult.\" Then he quoted Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as having said, \"I have <br>not come across any sight more terrifying than that of the 2 <br>grave.\" Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said, that <br>(BA<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to pray after <br>~<br>E<br>J<br> <br>every Salaat for protection against the chastisement in the 5 <br>grave. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) reported Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said, \"But for fear <br>that you might give up burying your dead, I would have <br>prayed to Almighty Allah to let you hear the torture of the <br>grave. With the exception of men and jinns, all other crea- <br>tures hear the punishment in the grave.\" <br>According to a hadith, once when Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was going on a journey, his she- <br>camel took fright. Someone asked him what had happened <br>to her. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied that <br>somebody was being punished in the grave, and the cries of <br>the punished had frightened the she-camel. <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaik wasallam) entered <br>the mosque and saw that some people were laughing very <br>loudly. He said to them, \"If you had remembered death <br>quite often, you would not have laughed like this. Not a <br>day passes when the grave does not proclaim, \"I am the <br>house of wilderness, the house of loneliness. and the abode <br>of worms and insects.\" When a true believer is buried in a <br>grave, it welcomes him, saying, \"You are welcome here, <br>you have done well to have come here. Of all the people <br>walking upon the earth, you were the dearest to me. Now <br>that you have been made over to me, you will see my excel- <br>lent behaviour.\" Then the grave expands to the farthest <br>point of sight, and a door of paradise opens into it. <br>Through this door comes the scented air of paradise. But <br><br>- <br>- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>when an unbeliever or a transgressor is buried, the grave <br>says, \"Your coming here is unwelcome and abominable. <br>You had better not come here. Of all the people who have <br>been walking upon me, I hated ypu the most. Today you <br>have been made over to me, and you will see my treat- <br>ment.\" Then it narrows down and presses him mercilessly, <br>till his ribs pierce into each other as the fingers of the two <br>hands interlock each other. Then ninety or ninety nine <br>dragons are let loose upon him, and they will continue <br>clawing at him till the Day of Resurrection. If one of those <br>serpents or dragons were to blow on the earth, it will be <br>rendered incapable of growing any grass till the Day of <br>Judgement. Then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>continued. \"The grave is either a garden out of Paradise or <br>a pit out of Hell.\" <br>Accordine to another hadith. Rasulullah lsallallaho <br>----.-<br>alaihe wasallgm) happened to pass by two grave'~. He said, <br>\"The two persons buried in these graves are being pun- <br>ished, one for back-biting and the other for polluting his <br>bodv with his urine.\" It is a pity that many of our so-called <br>civilized people regard isti4aa (washingthe private parts <br>after urination) as an undignified act, and even redicule it. <br>Some Ulama regard such pollution by urine as a major sin. <br>Ibn Hajar Makki (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that, <br>according to an authentic hadith, the punishment in the <br>grave is generally due to neglect of cleanliness from urine. <br>It is narrated in one hadith that interrogation in the <br>grave will first be about (pollution with) urine. In short, the <br>punishment of the grave is a very serious affair. Just as <br>some types of sins lead to this affliction, in the same way <br>certain virtuous acts provide special safeguard against it. It <br>is stated in several ahaadith that the recitation of surah <br>Tabarakal lazi ,every night guarantees security from the <br>tortures in the grave, as well as from that in the Hell. The <br>effectiveness of zikr in this respect is evident from the <br>above-mentioned hadith. <br>Hadith No. 51 <br>. <br>L <br>\\.Xi31j S! 41<br>u ;,p 3i <br>+UI j,;-lipJJGJ, <br>,. <br>., -<br>y<br>&<br> <br>A;$\\ 3:.gJ\\;&d <br>2 ;\\;i <br>,$ +;j > >> ,& +$c <br>.<br>dl &\\3. 1s A\\ 3 +ul;<br>JG A\\ 3 i > ~ . ,;JG- A\\ 2 i;&;\\<br>rl'. -<br>, 0<br>,<br> <br>i)Stf.J.\\j I4 u& J ~lljl\\p j(ij <br>J F,: <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, <br>(r0 <br>\"Almighty Allah will, on the Day of Resurrection, res- e3<br>urrect certain groups of people in such a state that <br>their faces will be radiant with light, they will be sit- <br>ting on pulpits of pearls and others will envy their lot. <br>They will neither be from among the Prophets nor <br>from among the martyrs.\" <br>Somebody asked the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to let him have <br>more details about these people, so that he may be able <br>to recognize them. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) replied, \"They will be the people who belong to <br>different families and different places, but assemble at <br>one place for the love of Almighty Allah and are en- <br>gaged in His zikr.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"In paradise there will be <br>pillars of emerald supporting balconied houses made of <br>rubies and with open doors on all the four sides. These will <br>shine like brilliant stars, and will be occupied by those <br>people who love each other for the sake of Allah, and who <br>assemble at a place and meet each other only for His pleas- <br>ure. <br>Nowadays, the religious devotees are criticizd and <br>ridiculed by everybody. The people may reproach them <br>today as much as they like, but the reality will dawn on <br>them in the Hereafter, when they will realize how these <br>humble persons have been able to earn high fortunes and <br>occupy such grand pulpits and such flats, whereas those <br>who criticized and ridiculed them had earned nothing but <br>misery and despair: <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>\"Soon the dust-cloud will clear away, and it will be <br>seen whether vou are riding a horse or an ass.\" <br>How blessed. in the eyes of Almighty Allah, are the <br>khanqahs (places where zikr is practised), which are the <br>targets of abuse from all quarters. can best be judged from <br>this hadith in their favour. It is mentioned in one hadith <br>that the houses where zikr is practised shine unto the <br>dwellers of the Heaven, as do the stars shine unto the in- <br>habitants of the Earth. According to another hadith, sakee- <br>nah (a very special blessing) descends on the gathering <br>engaged in zikr, the angels surround them, the divine <br>mercy covers them, and Almighty Allah mentions them on <br>His Throne. <br>Hadhrat Abu Razeen (Radhiyallaho anho) a Sahabi, <br>narrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said.!\"Shall I tell you something that will strengthen your <br>Imaan and earn you the blessings of Allah, the Great, in <br>both the worlds? It is the gatherings of those who do zikr of <br>Almighty Allah; you should make it a point to take part in <br>them, and when you are alone, do as much zikr as you <br>can.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) has ex-<br>plained that the houses in which zikr is done appear to be <br>as bright and shining as are the stars to the dwellers of the <br>Earth. These houses are so bright because of their light of <br>zikr, they shine like the stars. There are people who are en- <br>dowed by Almighty Allah with spiritual insight and are <br>capable of seeing this light in this very world. There &re <br>some who can recognise the spiritual persons and their <br>houses from the special radiance emitted by them. Hadhrat <br>Fudhail bin Iyaadh, (Kahmatullah alaih) a famous saint, <br>has said that the houses in which zikr is practised shine <br>like a lamp unto the dwellers of the Heavens. Sheikh <br>Abdul Aziz Dabbaagh, a saint of recent times, was illiterate <br>but he could clearly distinguish between the verses of the <br>Qur'an, Hadith Qudsi, and Hadith Nabawi. Me used to say <br>that words coming out from the mouth of the speaker carry <br>a distinguishing glow and that the words of Almighty Allah <br>carrv one kind of radiance and the words of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) carry another kind of radiance, <br>while the words of others are devoid of these two tvpes of <br>radiance. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>It is given in Tazkiratul Khaleel, the biography of Mau- <br>lana Khaleel Ahmad (May Allah enlighten his grave) that <br>Maulana Zafar Ahmad had related, \"When Maulana Kha- <br>lee1 Ahmad, on the occasion of his fifth Hajj, entered the <br>Masjidul Haraam for Tawaaful Qudoom, I was sitting in the <br>company of Maulana Muhibbuddeen, who was one of the <br>most trusted disciples of Maulana al-Haaj Imdaadullah Mu- <br>haajir Makki (May Allah enlighten his grave) and was well <br>known for his gift of divine foresight. He was then engaged <br>in his usual recitation of salawaat from a book, when all of <br>a sudden he turned to me and said, \"Who has entered the <br>Haram? The whole of the Haram has been flooded with his <br>radiance and light.\" I kept quiet. After a short while, Mau- <br>lana Khaleel Ahmad after completing his tawaaf happened <br>to pass by us. On seeing him Maulana Muhibbuddeen <br>stood up, smiled and said, \"Now indeed I see who has en- <br>tered the Haram today! \" <br>2 2<br>EN<br>The virtues of assembling for the sake of zikr have <br>been described in different ways in so many other ahaa- <br>dith. In one hadith, it is stated that salaat and gatherings for <br>zikr constitute the best ribaat. Ribaat stands for guarding <br>the boundaries of Daarus Salaam (the Muslim territory) <br>against invasion by the infidels. <br>Hadith No 13 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When <br>you pass the gardens of Paradise, graze to your heart's <br>content.\" Someone asked. \"0 Kasulullah! (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), what is meant by the gardens of <br>Paradise?\" He replied, \"Gatherings for performing <br>zikr.\" <br>What is meant is that if somebodv is lucky enough to <br>get access to such gatherings. he should take full advantage <br>of this, as these are the gardens of Paradise on this Earth. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>The words, \"graze to your heart's content\", signify that, <br>just as an animal grazing in a green pasture or garden does <br>not give up grazing in spite of being driven or beaten by its <br>owner, similarly a zaakir (one who practises zikr) should <br>not get pulled away from the gatherings for zikr by the <br>worldly anxieties and hindrances. The gatherings for zikr <br>are likened to the gardens of Paradise, because just as there <br>are no worries in the paradise, similarly gatherings of zikr <br>are safeguarded against every kind of calamity. <br>It is stated in one hadith that the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah cures all diseases of the mind, such as arrogance, <br>jealousy, malice, etc. The author of 'Fawaa'id fis Salaah <br>wal Awaa'id' has stated that constancy in zikr is a sure <br>safeguard against all kinds of calamities. According to an- <br>other hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has <br>said, \"I enjoin on you to do zikr of Allah profusely. It is <br>like taking refuge in a fort against a strong enemy. One who <br>practises zikr is as if it were in the company of Almighty <br>Allah.\" Can there be any benefit greater than that of being <br>in the company of the Almighty Lord? Moreover, it leads to <br>satisfaction of the mind, it enlightens the heart and re-<br>moves its callousness. In addition, there are many other <br>material and spiritual benefits, which are enumerated, upto <br>a hundred, by some Ulama. <br>A man came to see Hadhrat Abu Umaamah, (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and said to him, \"I saw in a dream that when- <br>ever you went or came out, or sat or stood up, the angels <br>prayed for you.\" Hadhrat Abu Umaamah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) replied, \"If you wish you can also earn their pray- <br>ers\", and recited the ayat: <br>i <br>\"0you who believe! celebrate the praises of Allah and <br>do this excessively and glorify Him morning and even- <br>I <br>ing. He sends blessings on you, as also His angels that <br>He may bring you out from the depths of darkness into <br>light, and He is full of Mercy to the believers.\" <br>i <br>This ayat was quoted to show that the Mercy of <br>Almighty Allah and the prayers of the angels can be earned <br>through zikr. The more we remember Allah, the more He <br>remembers us. <br><br>Hadith No 14 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"One <br>who is too weak to bear the strain of keeping awake at <br>night (in the worship of Almighty Allah), is too mi- <br>serly to spend his wealth in the path of Allah, and is <br>$ <br>8 2<br>too cowardly to take part in jihaad, is advised to <br>g~<br>remain engaged in the zikr of Allah.\" <br>i' <br>This shows that deficiencies in respect of non-obliga- <br>tory form of worship can be atoned through profuse zikr of <br>Almighty Allah. Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) re-<br>purted that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said, \"Zikr of Allah is a sign of Imaan, and it ensures <br>exemption from hypocrisy, and provides a safeguard <br>against the devil and protection from the fire of Hell.\" Be- <br>cause of all these benefits, zikr has been regarded as more <br>virtuous than many other forms of worship; it is specially <br>effective in providing protection against the Devil. It is <br>stated in one hadith that the Devil, in a kneeling position, <br>clings to the heart of a man, and when the man remembers <br>Almighty Allah the devil becomes helpless and frustrated <br>and therefore draws back, but whenever he finds the man <br>neglecting it he pollutes the heart with evil thoughts. It is <br>for this reason that the Sufis advise practising zikr excess- <br>ively, so that the heart remains free from evil thoughts and <br>becomes strong enough to resist the Devil. The Sahaba <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum) who had developed this inner <br>strength through the blessed company of Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) did not stand in such great need of <br>exercising zikr, but with the passage of time after Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) this resistive power of the <br>heart became weaker and weaker, and the need to remedy <br>this weakness through zikr became correspondingly <br>greater. In the present age, the hearts have become so de- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I <br>generate that no amount of treatment can restore their <br>strength to compare with that of the Sahabah. Nevertheless, <br>whatever improvement is effected is worthwhile at this <br>time when the disease has taken the form of an epidemic. <br>It is related about a holy man that he prayed to <br>Almighty Allah that he may be shown how Satan prevails <br>upon the heart. He found that the Satan sits like a mosquito <br>over the left side of the heart under the back of the shoul- <br>der and then advances his needle-like snout towards the <br>heart. If he finds the heart buzy in zikr he withdraws at <br>once, but if the heart is idle he injects the poison of evil <br>and sinful thoughts into it. It is stated in one hadith that <br>Satan keeps on sitting with the top of his nose over the <br>heart, and if the heart is buzy in zikr he withdraws in dis- <br>grace, but if it is idle he makes a morsel of it. <br>Hadith No 15 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"Practise zikr so excessively that people <br>may regard you as a maniac.\" It is stated in another <br>hadith \"Practise zikr so much that the hypocrite may <br>regard you as insincere.\" <br>It is clear from this hadith that the taunts of madness <br>and hypocrisy by the munaafiqs and by the foolish people <br>should not make one give up the spiritual wealth of zikr. <br>On the contrary, it should be done with such rapture and <br>abundance that those people may take you to be actually <br>mad and let you alone. They will consider you mad, only if <br>you practise zikr excessively and loudly, and not if you do <br>it quietly. <br>1 <br>b <br>!<br>I <br>I <br>I <br>l <br><br>Ibn Katheer (Rahmatullah alaih) has narrated, on the <br>authority of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) \"Nothing has been made obligatory by Almighty <br>Allah without fixing maximum limit for it and excusing <br>shortcomings in respect of it, except His zikr, for which no <br>limit has been fixed and no person, as long as he is sane is <br>exempted from it.\" Almighty Allah has ordered in the Holy <br>Quran: <br>\"Practise zikr of Allah excessively.\" A person should <br>do zikr under all circumstances, whether by day or <br>night; whether in the jungle or at sea; whether travel- <br>ling or halting; whether in. affluence or poverty; , <br>whether in sickness or health; whether loudly or <br>quietly. <br>j&g &  <br>In his book 'Munabbihaat', Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahmatul- 5 <br>lah alaih) writes that Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>while explaining the Quranic verse <br>Beneath it there was a treasure for them <br>said that the treasure meant a golden tablet, on which were <br>written the following seven lines: <br>(1) I wonder at the man who knows that he is to die <br>and indulges in laughter. <br>(2) \t I wonder at the man who knows that this world <br>will come to an end one day, but hankers after it. <br>(3) I wonder that a man who knows that everything is <br>predestined should lament the loss of anything. <br>(4) \t I wonder that a man who believes in the reckoning <br>in the Hereafter should amass wealth. <br>(5) \t I wonder that a man who has the knowledge of the <br> \t<br>fire of the Hell should commit any sin. <br>(6) \t I wonder that a man who believes in Almighty <br>Allah should remember anybody other than Him. <br>(7) \t I wonder that a man who believes in Paradise <br>should feel pleasure in anything of this world. <br>In some editions of that book. it is also added, \"I <br>wonder that a man who knows that Satan is his eternal <br>enemy should obey and follow him.\" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hafiz (Rahmatullah alaih) has also stated on the auth- <br>ority of Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Hazrat Jibra-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) laid so much stress on doing zikr that I <br>felt that without zikr nothing can benefit whatsoever.\" <br>The above mentioned quotations show that one should <br>practise zikr as much as possible; giving it up simply be- <br>cause others may call one mad or a hypocrite is fraught <br>with serious loss to oneself. The Sufis have written that it <br>is also a trap on the part of Satan that at first he discourages <br>one from zikr on the plea of avoiding criticism by the <br>people and, if he succeeds in this attempt, he is encouraged <br>and exploits this fear of criticism for preventing the person <br>from doing zikr forever. Although one should not do any <br>good deed for the sake of a show, yet if anybody happens to <br>see it one should not thereupon give it up. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah Zul Bajadeen (Radhiyallaho anhb), a <br>Sahabi, became an orphan in his childhood. He lived with <br>his uncle, who looked after him well. He had embraced <br>Islaam secretly and, when his uncle came to know of it, in <br>his anger, he turned him out of the house stark naked. His <br>mother was also displeased, but she took pity on him and <br>gave him a sheet of coarse cloth, which he tore into two <br>pieces, using one piece as a lower garment and the other as <br>an upper covering for the body. He migrated to Madina, <br>where he was always found before the house of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and used to practise zikr very <br>loudly. Hadhrat Unlar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"Is <br>this man a hypocrite that he does zikr so loudly? \"No\" <br>said Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), \"He is from <br>amongst the Awwaabeen,\" i.e. those who ever turn to <br>Almighty Allah. He died in the battle of Tabook. The Saha- <br>bah saw a lamp burning in the graveyard. On approaching <br>it, they found Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>standing in the grave and asking Hadhrat Abubakr and <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anhuma) to make over their <br>brother to him. The two made over the dead body to him <br>for burial. After the burial, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prayed, \"0 Allah! I am pleased with him, Thou <br>be also pleased with him.\" <br>On seeing this scene, Hadhrat Ibn Masood (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) wished that it should have been his corpse. <br>Hadhrat Fudhail (who was one of the great Sufis) <br>stated, \"To abstain from a virtuous act for fear of being seen <br>by the people is in itself an act of hypocrisy, and a good <br>action done with the intention to make a show amounts to <br>Shirk (false worship).\" <br>It is stated in one hadith that some persons are the <br>keys to zikr, i.e. their very sight reminds and inspires other <br>people to do zikr of Allah. According to another hadith, <br>such people are the friends of Allah whose very sight <br>makes others remember Almighty Allah. It is stated in one <br>hadith, \"The best amongst you are the people whose very <br>sight reminds you of Allah.\" Similarly it is stated in an- <br>other hadith, \"The best amongst you are those whose sight <br>makes you remember Almighty Allah, whose words add to <br>your knowledge, and whose actions induce you to work for <br>the love of the Hereafter.\" Of course, such a condition can <br>be attained by one who practises zikr profusely. One who <br>is himself indolent in this respect, his sight can hardly <br>inspire others to remember Allah. <br>2d <br>Some people regard zikr in loud voice as an innovation <br>E N  <br>i-<br>and forbidden in religion, but this view is due to lack of in- <br>sight into the knowledge of hadith. Maulana Abdul Hay, <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) has written a booklet 'Sabahatul Fikr' <br>on this very subject, wherein he has quoted about fifty <br>ahaadith in support of zikr in loud voice. However, it is <br>subject to proper limitations, so as not to annoy anybody <br>else. <br>Hadith Nu 16 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"The following seven persons will be accommo- <br>dated by Allah in the shade of His Mercy on the day <br>when there will be no other shade except His: (1)A <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>just ruler (2) A young man who worships Allah in his <br>youth (3) A person whose heart yearns for the musjid <br>(4) Those two persons who love, meet and depart only <br>for the pleasure of Allah. (5)A man who is tempted by <br>a beautiful woman and refuses to respond for fear of <br>Allah. (6)A person who gives alms so secretly that the <br>charity of one hand is not known to the other hand. (7) <br>A person who practises zikr of Allah in solitude, so <br>that tears flow of his eyes.\" <br>The flowing of tears can mean deliberate weeping, due <br>to repentance over one's past sins, but it may also mean a <br>spontaneous outburst of tears due to overwhelming passion <br>of love. Thaabit Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted <br>the words of a pious man, \"I come to know when a prayer <br>of mine is accepted.\" When asked as to how he comes to <br>know of it, he said, \"That prayer, at the time of which the <br>hair on my body stand up, my heart starts beating rapidly <br>and my eyes shed tears, is accepted by Allah.\" Among the <br>seven persons mentioned in the foregoing hadith, is in- <br>cluded also the person who weeps while doing zikr in soli- <br>tude. He combines two sublime qualities: first ikhlaas, <br>which makes him remember Allah in solitude, secondly <br>the fear or love of Allah, which makes him weep. Both <br>these things are extremely virtuous. According to a poet, <br>\"My work is to weep at night in remembering my be- <br>loved; and my sleep is to remain absorbed in thoughts of <br>my beloved.\" <br>('4631$i $j), (a<br>In the Arabic text of the hadith <br>person who remembers Allah when he is unoccupied), the <br>word 'unocc~~pied' <br>according to Sufis, has two- meanings. it <br>means in solitude, as is generally understood: but it also <br>signifies the heart being free from all thoughts except of <br>Almighty Allah, which constitutes the real solitude. The <br>ideal is to have both forms of solitude, physical as well as <br>mental. But if a person, even while in the company ot <br>others, has his heart free from all worldly thoughts and, <br>being absorbed in the zikr of Allah, happens to weep <br>thereby, he will also be rewarded as mentioned in this <br>i <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr<br>hadith, because the presence or absence of others makes no <br>difference to him. His heart is free from the thoughts, not <br>only of his companions, but also of everything other than <br>Almighty Allah. The presence of others cannot distract him <br>from his attention towards Allah. <br>To be able to weep for fear and love of Allah implies <br>possession of great spiritual wealth. Fortunate is he who is <br>blessed with it by Almighty Allah. It is stated in one hadith <br>that a person who weeps for fear of Allah will not be sent <br>to Hell till the milk goes back into the teats of an animal <br>(which is imposssible). This implies that it is similarly im- <br>possible for such a person to go to Hell. According to an- <br>other hadith, a person who weeps for fear of Allah will not <br>be punished on the Day of Judgement. <br>It is stated in one hadith that the fire of Hell is forbid- <br>den for two eyeszone that sheds tears for fear of Allah, and <br>the other that has remained awake in guarding the Muslims * <br>and Islaam against the infidels. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the fire of Hell is forbidden on the eye that has <br>gN <br>wept for fear of Allah, on the eye that has remained awake <br>in the path of Allah, on the eye that has refrained from the <br>unlawful and also on the eye that has been lost in the path <br>of Allah. <br>Yet another hadith states that a person who remembers <br>Allah in solitude is like one who goes all alone to fight <br>against the infidels. <br>Hadith No 17 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) said, \"An <br>announcer will call out on the Day of Judgement, <br>'Where are the wise ones?' People will enquire. 'Who <br>are meant by the wise ones?' The reply will be, 'They <br>are those who always remembered Allah, whether sit- <br>ting, standing or reclining, and pondered over the cre-<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ation of the Heaven and the Earth, and would say, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou hast not created all this in vain. We glo- <br>rify Thee: save us from the fire of Hell.\" Thereafter a <br>flag will appear for them. and they will follow this flag <br>and will be told to enter Paradise and stag for ever.\" <br>By \"pondering over the creation of the Heaven and the <br>Earth\" is meant that they contemplate over the phenomena <br>and secrets of the things created by Allah, and thereby <br>strengthen their spiritual knowledge. <br>The whole universe is like a garden planned and <br>planted by Allah. <br>As narrated by Ibn Abid Dunyaa, Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once approached a group of Sahabah <br>who were sitting in silence. He asked them what they were <br>thinking about. The Sahabah replied that they were pon- <br>dering over the wonderful creations cf Allah. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated it and said \"Do <br>not ever meditate over the Self of Almighty Allah, (He is <br>beyond comprehension), but do meditate over His creation\" <br>Somebody once asked Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) to relate some remarkable thing about Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She replied. \"There was noth- <br>ing about him that was not remarkable. Once he came <br>home at night and lay down in my bed. After a short while, <br>he said 'Let me pray to my Lord! Saying this, he got up, <br>performed wudhu and stood up in salaat. during which he <br>wept so profusely that tears flowed onto his chest. Then he <br>continued weeping in the same manner while performing <br>ruku and sajdah. He spent the whole night like this. till <br>Hadhrat Bilaal came to call the azaan for the morning <br>prayer. I pleaded with him. 'Almighty Allah has promised <br>you His forgiveness. then why did you weep so much?' He <br>replied, \"Should {not be a grateful slave of my Allah\", and <br>continued. \"Wby should I not pray and weep when these <br>verses have been revealed to me today: <br>? <br>01+\\L@ ........ <br>*g\\-dl+\\ & 2 4<br>h \t<br>2~J -<br>i <br>\"Lo! in the creation of heaven and earth. and in the <br>difference of night and day, are tokens (of His sover- <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>eignty) for men of understanding such as .remember <br>Allah standing, sitting and reclining . . . . <br>Then he added, 'Destruction is for the person who, in <br>spite of reading these verses, does not ponder over His cre- <br>ation.\" <br>Aamir bin Abdul Qais (Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"I <br>heard from the Sahabah not from one or two or three, but <br>from many of them-that the light and radiance of faith lies <br>in contemplation and meditation.\" Hadhrat Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrated, from Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) that a person lying on the roof of his <br>house was looking at the sky and stars for some time, and <br>then said, \"I swear by Allah and I believe there is some- <br>body who has created you all; 0 Allah! forgive me for my <br>sins.\" Thereupon Allah's mercy turned towards him and <br>he was forgiven. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said that meditation for a short duration of time is better <br>than worshipping throughout the night. Similarly, Hadhrat <br>Anas, (Radhiyallaho anho] narrated that meditation over <br>the creations of Allah is better than doing worship for <br>eighty years. Somebody asked Hadhrat Umme Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) as to what had been the best kind of <br>worship done by her husband, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho). She replied it was meditation and contem- <br>plation. According to Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said that medi- <br>tation and contemplation for a short duration of time is <br>better than worship for sixty years. It should not be de- <br>duced from the various quotations given above that medita- <br>tion obviates the necessity of worship. If anybody neglects <br>any form of worship, he is liable to the same penalty and <br>punishment, as for a fardh or waajib if a fardh or waajib is <br>abandoned, and so for a sunnat or mustahab if any of these <br>is neglected. <br>Imam Ghazaali (Rahmatullah alaih) has written that <br>meditation is held to be superior tr? zikr because, in ad- <br>dition to the essence of zikr, it includes two additional <br>things, of which one is recognition of Allah, for which <br>meditation is said to be the key, and secondly the love of <br>Allah, which is induced by deep thinking. It is this medita- <br>tion, which the Sufis call 'muraaqabah', and the virtue of <br>which is narrated in many ahaadith. <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reported that<br>Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said silent<br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>zikr, which is not heard even by the angels, is rewarded se- <br>venty times over. When, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah <br>will summon all the creation for reckoning, and the record- <br>ing angels will bring the recorded accounts of all the <br>people, Allah will ask them to verify if there is any more <br>good deed to the credit of a certain individual. They will <br>submit that they had not omitted anything from his re-<br>corded account. Allah will then say, there is yet one good <br>to his credit, which is not known to the angels, and it is his <br>zikr in silence. Baihaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted on <br>the authority of Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) that <br>the zikr that is not heard even by the angels is seventy <br>times superior to the zikr that is heard by them. The fol- <br>lowing Persian couplet refers to the same thing: <br>Between the lover and the beloved, there is a code of <br>communication that is not known even to the reporting <br>angels. <br>How fortunate are the people who do not remain idle <br>from zikr even for a moment. In addition to the reward that <br>they will get for their outward prayers, their zikr and medi- <br>tation throughout their life will earn for them seventy times <br>extra reward. It is for this reason that the devil remains <br>worried. <br>Hadhrat Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) is stated to have <br>seen Satan starkanaked in a dream. He asked him whether <br>he did not feel ashamed of the men around him. \"Are these <br>men?\" replied the devil, \"The men are those who are sit- <br>ting in the mosque of Shonezia, who have worried me so <br>much that my body has become lean and thin, and my <br>heart is burnt.\" Hadhrat Junaid (Rahamatullah alaih) writes <br>that he went to the mosque of Shonezia and saw that a few <br>i <br>men sitting there were deeply absorbed in meditation. <br>When they saw Hadhrat Junaid (Rahamatullah alaih) they <br>told him not to be misled by the deceptive words of the <br>wicked Satan. Similar to this, Masoohi (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>has also written about a dream. On seeing Satan in naked <br>condition, he asked him whether he did not feel ashamed <br>of being naked in the midst of men. The Satan replied, \"By <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>God! if they were men, I would not have toyed with them <br>as do the boys with their playball, Real men are those who <br>made me ill\", and he pointed to the group of Sufis. Abu <br>Sa'eed Khazzaar (Rahmatullah alaih) also states that he <br>once saw in a dream that Satan attacked him and he tried <br>to beat him back with a stick, but the Satan did not care for <br>this beating. Then he heard a heavenly voice saying that <br>the devil is not scared away by the beating, he is only <br>frightened by the spiritual light in one's heart. <br>Hadhrat Sa'od (Radhiyallaho anho) quoted Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said, \"The best zikr is <br>the silent one, and the best livelihood is that which just <br>suffices\", (i.e. it should neither be too insufficient to make <br>both ends meet, nor too abundant as to drive one to vanity <br>and vice). In another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said. \"Remember Allah <br>O <br>through perfect zikr\". When somebody enquired; \"What is <br>perfect zikr.\" He replied, \"Silent zikr.\" All the above <br>quoted narrations establish the excellence of zikr in si- ji<br>lence. We have also read the hadith that favours loud zikr, <br>as of a mad man. Either form of zikr is important under dif- <br>ferent sets of conditions. It is for the Shaikh (religious <br>guide) of a person to prescribe the best form of zikr for him <br>at a particular time. <br>Hadith No.18 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>house when the verse <br>was in his <br>Keep yourself bound to the company of those who <br>invoke their Lord, morning and evening <br>was revealed to him. On this revelation, he went out in <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>search of such people; he found a group of men who were <br>engaged in zikr. Some of them were with dishevelled hair, <br>parched skins, and clad in a single cloth i.e. except for the <br>loin cloth, the whole body was naked. On seeing them, Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sat down by them <br>and said, \"All praise is for Allah who has created in my <br>ummah such people that I have been ordered to sit in their <br>company.\" <br>According to aiother hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went out in search of them and found <br>them in the farthest part of the mosque, where they were <br>busy in zikr of Almighty Allah. He said, \"All praise is for <br>Allah Who has created, during my lifetime, such people <br>that I have been ordered to sit with them.\" Then he con- <br>tinued, \"My life and death is with you\" (i.e. You are my <br>companions in life and death.) It is mentioned in one <br>hadith that a group of Sahabah, including Hadhrat Salmaan <br>Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho) were engaged in zikr of Allah, <br>when Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>them. They became all silent. In reply to his enquiry as to <br>what they were doing, they submitted that they were prac- <br>tising zikr of Allah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"I saw that the mercy of Allah was descending upon <br>you, and so 1 desired that I should join your company. Al- <br>hamdu lillah (All praise is for Allah)\" he then continued, <br>\"Almighty Allah has raised such pecple in my ummah that <br>He ordered me to sit in their company.\" <br>It is from such orders of Almighty Allah that the Sufis <br>have deduced that the Shaikh should also sit with his dis- <br>ciples. In addition to the benefit. that will thereby accrue to <br>the disciples, it will provide good excercise for the person <br>of the Shaikh. In the effort to tolerate the vulgarities of the <br>uncivilized and uninitiated .people, his ego will undergo <br>severe strain, and thereby he will develop humbleness in <br>him. In addition to this, the get-together of the hearts is im- <br>portant for attracting the mercy and grace of Almighty <br>Allah. It was for this reason that offering prayers in congre- <br>gation was started, and this is why all the pilgrims (in uni- <br>form appearance) are made to pray to Allah together at the <br>same time, in the valley of Arafat. This point has been re- <br>peatedly and specially stressed by Shah Waliullah (Kahma- <br>tullah alaih) in his book, Hujjatullaahil Baalighah. <br>All these virtues, as mentioned in many ahaadith, <br>relate to the group of people who are engaged in zikr. On <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>the other hand, if somehow one happens to be in a group of <br>the negligent, and even there he keeps busy with zikr of <br>Allah, great reward is also promised for him, as stated in <br>many ahaadith. On such occasions, it is all the more <br>necessary that one should remain absorbed in remem-<br>brance of Allah, so that he is immune from the evil effect of <br>such company. <br>According to one hadith, a person who remains en- <br>gaged in zikr, while in the company of the negligent is like <br>one who remains steadfast in his allotted position in a <br>jihaad (holy war), while his companions are fleeing for <br>their lives. In another hadith, he is like one who fights the <br>infidels single-handed, after his companions have fled <br>away. He is also likened to a lamp in a dark house or a <br>beautiful green tree in autumn, when all the trees have <br>%<br>shed their leaves. Almighty Allah will show him before- <br>hand his abode in the Paradise; all his sins, even if equal to <br>2 +<br>the number of all men and animals, will be forgiven. All <br>these rewards are subject to the condition that one remains g h  <br>engaged in zikr while in the company of the negligent; <br>otherwise it is forbidden even to join in such meetings. <br>According to one hadith, one should keep away from <br>those so-called friendly gatherings where there is nothing <br>but idle talk and merrymaking. A pious man once took his <br>negro maid-servant to the bazaar. He left her at a place and <br>asked her to await for his return there; went about the <br>market. When he returned, he was upset to find her miss- <br>ing. He went home, when he found the maid-servant was <br>already there. She came to him and said. '0 Master! do not <br>be angry with me in the haste; you left me in the midst of <br>people who were absolutely negligent in the remembrance <br>of Allah; I feared lest some calamity should befall them, or <br>the Earth should devour them. and I too be buried along <br>with them.\" <br>Hadith No. 19 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said that <br>Almighty Allah says, \"Do My zikr for some time after <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Fajr salaat and after Asr salaat, and I will suffice for <br>you during the intervening periods.\" <br>In one hadith it is stated, \"Do zikr of Allah, He will <br>look after your interests.\" <br>Note: <br>We work so hard for this worldly life, though not for <br>the life Hereafter. We lose nothing if we remember Allah <br>for a little while after Fajr and after Asr, because so many <br>virtues have been mentioned for doing zikr at these two <br>times. When Almighty Allah promises His full help, what <br>more is needed? <br>According to one hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said, \"I prefer sitting with those who remain <br>busy in remembering Allah after Fajr prayer up to sunrise, <br>to the noble act of setting four Arab slaves free; and simi- <br>larly I prefer sitting with ths group who remain busy in <br>zikr !of Allah after Asr salaat up to sunset to setting four <br>slaves free.\" According to another hadith, if a person offers <br>Fajr salaat in congregation and remains engaged in zikr of <br>Allah until sunrise, and then offers two rakaats of nafl <br>salaat, his reward will equal to that of a perfect Hajj and <br>Umrah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also <br>stated to have said, \"offering Fajr salaat in congregation, <br>and then remaining busy in zikr until sunrise, is more pre- <br>cious to me than this world and all that it contains. Simi- <br>larly, remaining busy in zikr with a group after Asr till <br>sunset is preferred by me to this world and everything that <br>it contains.\" It is for this reason that the time after Fajr and <br>Asr prayers is specially reserved for zikr as a matter of rou- <br>tine by the Sufis. Especially, the time after Fajr prayer is <br>also reserved for zikr, even by the Fuqahaa i.e. the Muslim <br>jurists. <br>I<br>It is stated in the book 'Mudawwanah' on the authority <br>of Imaam Maalik (Ral~matullali alaih) that it is makrooh <br>i<br>(undesirable) to indulge in talking during the time between <br>i<br>Fajr and sxnrise. From amongst the Hsnafees the author of <br>Durrul Mukhtaar also regarded it undesirable to indulge in <br>talking during this time. According to one hadith, if after <br>Fajr prayer a person continues to sit in the same posture <br>before talking, recites the following kalimah ten times, ten <br>virtues will be recorded to his account, ten sins remitted, <br>his position in Paradise raised by ten degrees, and he will <br><br>be protected from the Devil and other undesirables <br>throughout the day. <br>Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah; He is one, <br>and He has no partner. This world and the Hereafter belong <br>to Him and He is worthy of all praise; life and death are <br>controlled by Him, and He controls the destiny of every- <br>thing. <br>According to another hadith, whosoever, after Fajr and <br>Asr, recites three times the following prayer: <br>I seek pardon of Allah, except whom there is nobody <br>worthy of worship and Who is living and eternal; I turn to <br>Him. <br>All his sins, even if big like the sea, will be forgiven. <br>Hadith No. 20 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The <br>world and all it contents, are accursed (i.e. are devoid <br>of Allah's mercy), except the folowing three: <br>(1) zikr of Allah and everything that is near it, <br>(2) the (Religious) aalim, and, <br>(3) the student (the seeker of religious knowledge).\" <br>The first may mean either the things near to zikr of <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Allah, in which case all the things that are helpful in doing <br>zikr, such as eating and drinking in reasonable quantities, <br>and all other necessities of life, as also all forms of worship <br>are implied therein; or it may mean the things near to <br>Allah, in which case it will mean all forms of worship of <br>Allah, and the zikr would mean special form of zikr. In <br>both cases, 'ilm is included therein, because in the first <br>case, it is 'ilm that leads one to zikr, and whereas an ignor- <br>ant man cannot recognize.Allah and in the second case be- <br>cause 'ilm (i.e. religious knowledge) is the best form of <br>worship. In spite of this, the 'aalim and the student have <br>been specially mentioned separately for emphasis. 'ilm, <br>indeed, is a great wealth. <br>According to one hadith, \"Learning 'ilm just for the <br>pleasure of Allah is a proof of the fear of Allah, travelling <br>in search of it is a worship, memorizing it is like glorifying <br>Allah, making research in it is like jihaad, reading it is like <br>chari!~, and teaching it to one's members of family pro- <br>motes nearness to Allah. This is because 'ilm enables one <br>to distinguish between right and wrong; it is the road sign <br>indicating the way to Paradise: it provides consolation in <br>wilderness and a conlpanion while travelling, because <br>reading a book serves this dual purpose. Further, it is like a <br>companion to talk to in solitude, a guide during pain and <br>pleasure, and a weapon for friends against foes. Because of <br>this, Almighty Allah raises the position of Ulama, because <br>they propagate the right, provide a lead for others. so that <br>with their deeds, and their advice be sought and acted <br>upon in all matters. The angels love to befriend them. and <br>rub their wings over them to be blessed or to show love. All <br>things, whether of land or in sea, including fish in the sea, <br>beasts of the jungle. animals and even poisonous insects <br>and reptiles like the snakes, pray for their forgiveness. All <br>this is because 'ilm is a light for the heart as well as for the <br>eyes: it urges one to be one of the best personalities of the <br>ummat, and enables one to attain high position in this life <br>as also in the Hereafter. Its study is as virtuous as fasting, <br>and its memorising is like offering Tahajjud prayer. It pro- <br>motes good relations: and it helps distinguish between <br>right and wrong; it is a prerequisite for good deeds and <br>controls them. The blessed are inspired by it and the ac- <br>cursed are deprived of it.\" <br>' <br>Though some authorities have questioned the overall <br>authenticity of this hadith, yet the virtues mentioned <br>1 I \t<br>I <br>I <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>herein are by parts corroborated by many other ahaadith. In <br>fact, many additional virtues are mentioned in the books of <br>ahaadith, let alone the foregoing accounting for the specific <br>mention of the 'aalim' and the student in the fore-men- <br>tioned hadith. <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim (Rahmatullah alaih), a well-known <br>muhaddith, has written an authentic book, named 'al-Waa- <br>bilus Sayyib', on the virtues of zikr. He has stated therein <br>that the virtues of zikr are more than one hundred and he <br>has listed seventy nine of these, which are briefly given <br>below in the same order. Some of these include multiple <br>benefits, and for this reason their actual number is more <br>than one hundred: <br>(1) Zikr keeps \t away the Satan and weakens his <br>L. <br>strength. \t<br>o <br>m L<br>2 4<br>(2) \t It is the cause of Almighty Allah's pleasure. <br>Z N<br>.-+<br>(3) \t It relieves the mind of anxieties and worries. <br>(4) \t It produces joy and happiness in the heart. <br>(5) \t It strengthens the body and the mind. <br>(6) \t It brightens the face and the heart. <br>(7) \t It attracts one's sustenance. <br>(8) \t It invests the zaakirs with awe and sweetness so <br>that the seeing eye is filled with awe and pleasure <br>at his sight. <br>(9) \t It induces love for Allah, which in fact is the spirit <br>of Islaam and the pivot of deen, and the source of <br>success and salvation in the Hereafter. He who <br>seeks access to the love of Almighty Allah should <br>do zikr profusely. Just as reading and repetition is <br>the door of knowledge, so zikr of Allah is the gate- <br>way to His love. <br>(10)Zikr \t involves muraaqabah (deep meditation), <br>through which one reaches the stage of Ihsaan, <br>wherein a person worships Almighty Allah as if <br>he is actually seeing Him. (The attainment of this <br>stage of Ihsaan is the ultimate objective of the <br>Sufis). <br>(11)It helps realization of Allah so that by and by a <br>stage is reached when he comes to regard <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i <br>Almighty Allah as his sole Cherisher, Guardian <br>and Master, and he turns unto Him, in all afflic- <br>tions. <br>I <br>(12) It is the key to nearness to Almighty Allah; the <br>greater the zikr, the greater the nearness to Allah, <br>and greater the indifference to zikr, the greater the <br>distance from Him. <br>(13)It opens the door of Ma'rifat (realization) of Allah. <br>(14)It makes one realize the greatness and grandeur of <br>Almighty Allah, and strengthens the conscious- <br>ness of his omni-presence. <br>(15)Zikr of Allah causes one's mention in the Court of <br>Allah, as said in the Holy Book. <br>% <br>Remember me, and I will remember you, <br>and as stated in a hadith <br>I <br>Whosoever remembers me in his heart, I remember <br>, <br>him in My heart. <br>I<br>! <br>It has already been explained under other verses <br>and ahaadith that, even if there were no other <br>good points in zikr, except that mentioned above, <br>this alone would have established its superiority <br>over others. Nevertheless, there are many more <br>virtues and benefits of zikr. <br>(16)It gives life to the heart. Hafiz Ibn Taimiyah (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) says that zikr is as necessary for <br>the heart as water for the fish. Imagine the con- <br>dition of a fish out of water. <br>(17) It is food for the heart and the soul; depriving <br>them of zikr is like depriving the body of its food. <br>(18)It cleanses the heart of its rust. It has been men- <br>tioned in an earlier hadith; everything .rusts <br>according to its nature; and the heart rusts with <br>wordly desires and indifference, to purify it zikr is <br>necessary. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>(19) It safeguards against pitfalls and lapses. <br>(20) The heart of a neglectful person is tormented by a <br>feeling of remoteness from Allah, and nothing <br>other than zikr can rid the heart of this feeling. <br>(21) The words of zikr keep on moving round the Arsh <br>of Almighty Allah, as stated in a hadith. <br>(22) If one remembers Allah in happiness, Almighty <br>Allah remembers him in his afflictions. <br>(23) It is a means to deliverance from Allah's punish- <br>ment. <br>(24) It causes Allah's peace and mercy to descend, <br>while angels surround the person engaged in zikr. <br>(25) It saves the tongue from indulging in backbiting, <br>loose talk, lies and abuses. It is a common experi- <br>ence that a man whose tongue remains engaged in <br>zikr does not commit these absurdities. On the <br>other hand, the tongue that is not used in zikr, <br>falls an easy prey to all kinds of useless talk. <br>'z-<br>9 3 <br>y N <br>S <br>(26) The gatherings of zikr are gathering of angels, and <br>gatherings without zikr are gatherings of Satan. A <br>person is free to have a choice between the two, <br>and verily man, by instinct, is drawn towards <br>what is akin to his temperament. <br>(27)By virtue of zikr, the zaakir is blessed, as also the <br>person sitting by him. Similarly the indolent <br>person is accursed for his indolence, as also the <br>person sitting by him. <br>(28) Zikr will save one from despair on the Day of <br>Judgement. This is confirmed by one of the ahaa- <br>dith which says that the gathering devoid of <br>Allah's zikr will cause sorrow and losses on that <br>day. <br>(29) If zikr is shared by tears and repentance in loneli- <br>ness the zaakir will be blessed under the shadow <br>of Allah's throne on the Day of Judgement, when <br>hearts will jump to lips due to agony of intolerable <br>heat of that day. <br>(30)Those who remain busy in zikr are better re-<br>warded by Allah than those who remain busy in <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>du'aa and supplication. According to one hadith, <br>Almighty Allah says that I will give better reward <br>to one who is abstained by his engagements in zikr <br>from making du'aa than all those who find time <br>for making du'aa. <br>(31)In spite of the fact that zikr is the easiest f ~ r l i iof <br>worship (the movement of the tongue being easier <br>than the movement of any other party of the body), <br>yet it is the most virtuous form. <br>(32)Allah's zikr helps the plants of Paradise to grow. <br>(33)Of all actions the reward and forgiveness promised <br>for zikr is the highest. According to one hadith if <br>on any day a person repeats one hundred times <br>the kalimah: <br>There is none worthy of worship except Allah, the <br>One. There is no partner with Him; His is the king- <br>dom, and for Him is all praise, and He is All-pow- <br>erful to do everything, <br>he is rewarded as for freeing ten slaves, and in ad- <br>dition one hundred virtues are written to his ac- <br>count and one hundred sins are forgiven. He <br>remains protected against the devil throughout the <br>day, and none is considered as having acted better <br>than him except one who has recited these words <br>more often than him. Similarly, there are many <br>other ahaadith proclaming the superiority of zikr <br>over all other good deeds. <br>(34)Due to incessant zikr one is able not to forget one's <br>soul. Forgetting one's soul leads to failure in both <br>the worlds, because forgetting the remembrance of <br>Allah leads to neglecting one's soul and all its best <br>interests. Allah says in His book: <br>And be not ye as those who forgot Allah and there- <br>fore He caused them to forget their souls. Such are <br>the evil-doers. <br>Thus, when one forgets one's soul he becomes <br>I <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr \t<br>careless and forgets his re81 interests which leads <br>to his ruin just as a garden or field is invariably <br>ruined when its owner fails to look after it. Protec- <br>tion against this ruin can only be provided by <br>keeping one's tongue always busy in zikr, so that <br>zikr should become as indispensable as water is at <br>the extreme thirst, or food at the time of hunger, or <br>the house and clothes for protection against ex-<br>treme heat and cold. As a matter of fact, one <br>should be more mindful of zikr than any of these <br>material necessities, which at the most can result <br>in physical death, which is a small loss as com- <br>pared with the spiritual death. <br>(35)Zikr \t is the source of one's spiritual elevation <br>whether done in bed or in the market, whether in <br>% <br>good health or in sickness, or even when one is <br>8 5  <br>making most of the pleasures of life. Nothing but <br>g 3<br>zikr can take a man to such spiritual heights, <br>whereby his heart is so illuminated with the light <br>of zikr that even asleep he is more wakeful than <br>the neglectful person who is awake all through the <br>night. <br>(36)The noor (radiance) of zikr remains with a person <br>in his life as well as in his grave. It will go in front <br>of him on the Siraat. in the Hereafter. Almighty <br>Allah says in the Quran: <br>'<br>a<br>.<br>& b $ # G l & ? &  <br>Can he who was desd and whom We gave life, and <br>a light whereby he can walk among men, be like <br>him who is in utter darkness whence he cannot <br>emerge. <br>The one mentioned first is the faithful, who be- <br>lieves in Allah and shines with the light of His <br>love, zikr, and cognizance, while the second one is <br>devoid of all these virtues. In reality this radiance <br>is a great blessing and leads to perfect success. <br>That is why Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) used to beg for it in prolonged prayers, and <br>prayed for noor for every part of his body. As men-<br>tioned in many ahaadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>1 \t<br>alaihe wasallam) prayed that Almighty Allah may <br>bless his flesh, bones, muscles, hair, skin, eyes and <br>ears with noor, and that he may be surrounded <br>with noor on all sides; he even prayed that he may <br>be blessed with noor from top to bottom, and that <br>his whole person may be made into noor. One's <br>deeds will shine according to the noor in oneself, <br>so much so that the good deeds of some people <br>(while going upto heaven) will shine like the sun. <br>Similar noor will be found in their faces on the <br>Day of Judgement. <br>(37)Zikr is the basic principle of Tasawwuf (Sufism) <br>and is invoked in all the schools of Sufism. A <br>person who gets conversant with zikr enters the <br>gateway to Almighty Allah, and one who enters <br>this gateway is sure to reach Almighty Allah, from <br>Whom he will get whatever he wants, for Allah's <br>treasures are unlimited. <br>(38)There is not a corner in the heart of a man, which <br>can not be filled but with zikr. When zikr controls <br>the heart, not only does it fill up this corner, but <br>also does it lead the zaakir to contentment which <br>wealth would fail to produce and to respect among <br>people, which the family or party would fail to <br>bring about, and to such control over people as a <br>sovereign would never dream of. On the other <br>hand, the indolent comes to disgrace, in spite of <br>all his wealth and riches, party, strength and <br>powers. <br>(39)Zikr transform dispersion into concentration, and <br>concentration into dispersion; and remoteness into <br>nearness and nearness into remoteness. This <br>means that one is relieved of one's troubles, wor- <br>ries and fears, and is blessed with peace of mind. <br>I <br>His mistakes and sins are forgiven, and the devils <br>who are after him are dispersed away. It makes <br>him to remember that the Hereafter is not far <br>away, and the worldly life has little attraction for <br>hi^. <br>I <br>(40)Zikr does not allow one's heart to suffer from for- <br>getfulness, which leads to ignore one's ultimate in- <br>terest. <br><br>Ch. I: .Ahaadith on Zikr <br>(41)Zikr is just like a tree, the fruit of which is realiza- <br>tion of Almighty Allah. The more zikr is done, the <br>stronger shall grow the root of this tree; and <br>stronger the root of this tree, the more abundant <br>the fruit it will bear. <br>(42)Zikr of Almighty Allah promotes nearness to Him <br>and thereby earns His constant patronage. It is <br>given in the Quran <br>ljih j;$l <br>b 5! <br>No doubt Allah is with those who fear Him. <br>It is stated in one hadith <br>. - '<br>&w j& <br>J <br>(I <br>I am with my slave who remembers Me. \t<br>$$ <br>EN <br>According to another hadith, Allah says, \"Those <br>i' <br>who remember Me are My men, and I do not de- <br>prive them of My mercy. When they repent, I am <br>their friend, but when they do not repent. I am <br>their physician. I put them to worries to condone <br>their sins.\" Nearness to Almighty Allah resulting <br>from zikr has no parallel. No words and no writing <br>can describe this nearness. Its taste is known only <br>to those who are blessed with it. (May Almighty <br>Allah also bless me with the same). <br>(43)Zikr of \t Allah is as meritorious as liberating of <br>slaves, and spending in charity, and jihaad in the <br>path of Allah. <br>(Many virtues of this kind have already been de- <br>scribed and more will further be narrated in this <br>book). <br>(44)Zikr is the fundamental form of thanksgiving to <br>Almighty Allah. One who does not do zikr cannot <br>thank him. It is stated in hadith that Hadhrat <br>Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had asked Almighty Allah <br>\"0My Lord! You have done me countless favours, <br>teach me the manner in which I should thank you <br>befittingly.\" Almighty Allah said, \"The more zikr <br>you do, the more thanks you offer.\" According to <br>another hadith, Hadhrat Moosa (Alayhis salaam) is <br>reported to have said, \"0,Lord! how can I offer <br>Virtues of Zikr \t<br>thanks worthy of Your greatness.\" Almighty Allah <br>replied, \"Let your tongue always remain engaged <br>in zikr.\" <br>(45)According to Almighty Allah, the best of the pious <br>people are those who always remain busy in zikr, <br>because piety leads to paradise, and zikr to the <br>nearness to Allah: <br>(46)There is a sort of hardness in the human heart, <br>which is not softened by anything except zikr. <br>(47)In fact, zikr is a remedy for all ills of the heart. <br>(48)Zikr of Allah is the root of His love, and neglecting <br>zikr is the root of His enmity. -<br>(49)Nothing is more effective than zikr in attracting <br>Allah's blessings and in warding off His chastise- <br>ment. <br>(50)Almighty Allah grants His grace to those who do <br>zikr, and the angels pray for them. <br>(51)One who wants to remain in the gardens of Para- <br>dise, even in this life, should sit in the gatherings <br>of zikr, because these are likened to the gardens of <br>Paradise. <br>(52)Gatherings of zikr are also the gatherings of angels. <br>(53)In the presence of the angels, Almighty Allah <br>praises those who do zikr. <br>(54)One who 'is constant in doing zikr will enter Para- <br>dise in high spirits. <br>(55)All good deeds have been \t ordained because of <br>zikr.. <br>(56)A good deed becomes superior to others of its kind <br>because of zikr. Of the fasts, the one with more <br>I <br>zikr is the best; Of the Hajj, one with excessive <br>zikr is more virtuous. Similar is the case with <br>other good deeds like jihaad etc; <br>(57)Zikr is a substitute of nafl salaat and other non- <br>obligatory devotions. It is related in one hadith <br>that the poor people once complained to Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho a!aihe wasallam) of the higher <br>reward available to the rich because of their <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>wealth. They said, \"These rich men offer prayers <br>and fast, just as we do, but they excel us by per- <br>forming Umrah and Hajj, and taking part in jihaad <br>on account of their wealth.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Should I tell you some- <br>thing, so that none except one who practices it can <br>excel you.\" He then advised them to recite after <br>every salaat: <br>By this Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>had indicated the importance of zikr, to be the <br>substitute for various kinds of worship, like <br>Umrah, Hajj, jihaad, etc. <br>o<br>(r aa<br>(58)Zikr is very helpful to all other forms of worship. <br>g R<br>Excessive zikr creates love for various forms of <br>worship, so that one starts taking delight in their <br>performance and never feels bored or burdened <br>while offering them. <br>(59)Zikr is a solution to all difficulties, and remedy for <br>all handicaps. It lightens every burden, and re-<br>lieves every affliction. <br>(60)Zikr dispels every fear of the heart. It has a special <br>hand in inducing peace of mind and for relieving <br>the heart of its fear. To free the heart of its fears <br>and mind of its perplexity is one of the specific <br>qualities of zikr. The greater, therefore, the amount <br>of zikr, the greater freedom from fear. <br>(61)By zikr one is blessed with divine help that asso- <br>ciates in all one's doings. That is why some time <br>man's achievements surpass his powers, and he <br>attains what was seemingly beyond his reach. <br>This is perhaps the reason why Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) advised his daughter <br>Hadhrat Fatimah, (Radhiyallaho anha) to recite <br>B i;;ji a, ;G thirty three times each and ;;i&thirty <br>, . <br>four times before going to bed at night, when she <br>approached him for a helper, complaining that she <br>was over-worked by the labour of grinding wheat <br>and doing other house-hold jobs. 'The Prophet <br>80 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) further said, \"The <br>recitation of these kalimahs is better for you than a <br>servant.\" <br>(62)Those who are working for the life Hereafter are in <br>a race, wherein the zaakirs shall remain ahead of <br>all on account of their zikr. On the day of Judge- <br>ment, says Umar Maula Ghufra (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), when people will be rewarded for their <br>good deeds, many shall repent why they neglected <br>zikr when it was easiest of all good deeds and the <br>highest in reward. In a hadith, Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) is quoted to have said, \"The <br>mufarrideen have surpassed all.\" He was asked, <br>\"Who were the mufarrideen?\" The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Those who toil <br>hard for zikr because it lightens their burdens.\" <br>(63)Those who do zikr are held truthful by Almighty <br>Allah, and those who are testified as such by <br>Almighty Allah cannot be raised among the liars <br>on the Day of Judgement. It is quoted on the auth- <br>ority of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that <br>when a man utters, <br>Allah proclaims, \"My slave has spoken the truth, <br>and nobody is worthy of worship except I, and I <br>am the Greatest of all.\" <br>(64)Zikr causes houses to be built in Paradise by the <br>angels. When zikr is stopped, the angels also stop <br>construction of houses. When asked why a par-<br>ticular construction was stopped by the angels, <br>they reply, \"The construction had to be stopped <br>because funds for that were stopped. The fact is <br>I <br>confirmed by a hadith, which says when a man re- <br>cites 41b G  4 k j  <br>d% <br>seven times, a tower <br>is raised for him in paradise. <br>(65)Zikr provides protection against Hell. If, due to <br>any misdeed a zaakir deserves Hell, his zikr acts as <br>a defence between him and the Hell, the more his <br>zikr, the stronger will be this defence. <br>(66)The~ngelspray for the forgiveness of those who do <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>zikr. It is related on the authority of Hadhrat Amr <br>bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) that when a man says <br>j <br>1 9% <br>9.1 <br>the angels pray to <br>4; A-l;iji <br>Almighty Allah for his forgiveness. <br>(67)The mountain or plain on which zikr is recited <br>feels proud of it. According to a hadith, one moun- <br>tain asks another if any zaakir has crossed over it <br>during the day. If the.reply is in the affirmative. it <br>feels happy. <br>(68)Zikr guarantees immunity from hypocrisy, for <br>Almighty Allah has described the hypocrite as <br>% YI i l  b;;ij; <br>y They do not remember Allah except <br>very rarely. It is also related on the authority of <br>Ka'b Ahbaar (Radhiyallaho anho) that he who <br>makes frequent zikr of Allah is free from hypoc- <br>risy. <br>e l  <br>(69)Compared with other good deeds, zikr carries a <br>special taste, which is not to be found in any other <br>action. Even if there were no other virtue to zikr, <br>this fine taste alone would have been a sufficient <br>reward to justify it. Maalik bin Deenaar (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) has said that nothing surpasses the taste <br>of zikr, which is the best and finest. <br>(70)The faces of those who do zikr remain bright in <br>this life, and will carry a special radiance in the <br>Hereafter. <br>(71)One who is frequently engaged in zikr, whether he <br>is in or out of his house, whether he is stationary <br>or travelling, he will find, on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, a large number of witnesses in his favour. <br>Almighty Allah has described the Day of Judgment <br>as 6jVI LLJ +3 The day when the Earth will tell <br>all that it knows. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked his <br>companions if they knew what those news would <br>be. They expressed their ignorance. Then Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whatever <br>deed is done, good or bad, by any man or woman <br>on the face of the Earth, the Earth will describe it <br>all, with d a t ~ ,  time and place.\" Hence, one who <br>does zikr at many places will find many witnesses <br>in his favour. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I <br>(72)As long as the tongue is busy in zikr, it cannot in- <br>dulge in lies, backbiting or any other kind of evil <br>talk. The tongue will engage itself in useless talk if <br>it is not in zikr, because it-cannot remain quiet. So <br>is the case with the heart; if it is devoid of love for <br>Almighty Allah, it will be filled with the love of <br>I <br>worldly things. <br>(73)The devils are outright enemies of man and always <br>create trouble for him and keep him surrounded. <br>I <br>The miserable condition of one who remains sur- <br>rounded by enemies can well be imagined, espec- <br>ially when the enemies are vindictive and <br>everyone of them wants to surpass the other in <br>troubling him. Nothing except zikr can protect <br>him against these enemies. Many forms of du'aa <br>are mentioned in the ahaadith, so that, if any of <br>these is recited by a person, then Satan dare not <br>come near him. If the same is recited at the time of <br>going to bed, one remains safe from the Satan <br>throughout the night. Hafiz Ibn Qayyim (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih) has also mentioned many such <br>du'aas. <br>In addition to these, the author has also mentioned in <br>detail under six headings the relative merits of zikr as also <br>some of its virtues, which are specific to zikr alone. Then <br>he has also given seventy five chapters on special du'aas, <br>which are suited to specific times and occasions. For the <br>sake of brevity, these have been excluded from this book. <br>For those blessed with determination to act, the virtues of <br>zikr detailed above are more than enough, and for those <br>who are disinclined to act, thousands of such virtues <br>would be of little avail. <br>sig,&; & <br>$! 3 3<br>.-. b, <br>I<br>< -<br>Whatever good I have done is through the grace of <br>i <br>Almighty Allah; I, therefore, depend on Him and turn <br>to Him. <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>KALIMAH TAYYIBAH <br>Kalimah Tayyibah, which is also called Kalimah Tau- <br>heed (utterance of Unity), has been mentioned in the <br>Qur'an and the hadith far more frequently than anything <br>else. Since all the saints and Prophets had been sent speci- <br>fically with the primary aim of propagating the Unity of <br>Allah, its excessive mention can well be understood. In the <br>Holy Qur'an, this kalimah has been referred to by various <br>names and in different contexts. It has been referred to as <br>Kalimah Tayyibah (excellent utterance), cat J3)(firm state- <br>%<br>V) L.<br>ment) (cs# iJS) (utterance of piety), (/jJlj al&l <br>(key of <br>heaven and earth), etc: as will be found in the Qur'anic <br>E N  <br>verses given in the following pages. Imaam Ghazaali (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) has written in his book Ihyaa that it is <br>(+PILIo (utterance of Unity) W * ~ U )  (utterance of sincer- <br>ity) (&#dlLK) (utterance of piety) (aU)(excellent utter- <br>ance) ( j r 3 1 a ~ j )(strong rope) (&I Yj) (call of truth) (SlJ;) <br>(price of paradise). <br>As this kalimah has been mentioned in various con- <br>texts in the Holy Qur'an, this chapter is divided into three <br>parts. The first part includes those verses wherein the <br>words of Kalimah Tayyibah do not occur, although it is im- <br>plied therein. Each verse is followed by a brief explanation, <br>as given by the Sahabah and by Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself. <br>The second part consists of t h o s ~  <br>verses which contain tlie <br>text of Kalimah Tayyibah i.e. ~ I Y !  in full-, or slightly<br>J!Y <br>modified, such as j i y ~i ~ j .  <br>the kalimah <br>As the words of <br>occur in these verses, their translation has not been consid- <br>ered necessary. Only the surah and ruku, in which the avat <br>occurs, has been indicated. The third part includes the <br>translation and explanation of those ahaadith that describe <br>the virtues and importance of this kalimah <br>(Whatever has been done is merely through Allah's grace). <br><br>I<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>PARTI \t<br>I <br>I <br>This contains those ayaat in which the words of the <br>Kalimah Tayyibah do not occur, although it is implied <br>therein: <br>(I) \t Seest thou not how Allah explains through a parable. <br>Good words are like a good tree that is firmly rooted <br>and its branches reach the sky. It brings fruit at all <br>times, under order from its Lord. So Allah explains <br>through parables for men that they may take heed. The <br>parable of evil words is like an evil tree. It is torn up <br>by the root from the surface of the Earth. It has no sta- <br>bility. <br>Note: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has explained <br>that the words \"Kalimah Tayyibah\" in this ayat mean the <br>Kalimah Shahaadat <br>which is like a tree with its roots in the hearts of the faith- <br>ful and its branches spread out up to Heaven, by means <br>of which the deeds of the faithful climb up to Heaven; and <br>w w  (ugly utterance) is the utterance of Shirk, which <br>prevents any good deed from being accepted. In another <br>hadith, it is stated by Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>\"bearing of fruit all the time\" means that almighty Allah be <br>remembered day and night. <br>It was narrated by Hadhrat Qataadah (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) that somebody had said to Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), \"The rich are able to earn great rewards <br>(by virtue of spending their wealth in charity)\". Rasulullah <br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Tell me if anybody <br>can reach the sky by piling up his goods one over the other. <br>I tell you of something, which has its roots in the Earth and <br>its branches spread out into the Heaven. It is recitation of <br>the kalimah <br>ten times each after every salaat. <br>(2) \t Whosoever desires glory and power (should know) that <br>L. <br>glory and all powers belong to Allah; Unto Him good <br>sg<br>words ascend and He exalts all righteous deeds. <br>tfN<br>-<br>According to the majority of :o~mentators, the Kali- <br>S <br>mah Tayyibah in this ayat means (&Iys ir!9), but some are of <br>the opinion that it implies the kalimah of tasbeeh. as will <br>be described in part 11. <br>(3) \t The word of thy Lord finds its fulfilment in truth and <br>in justice. <br>According to Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho), Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said that the kali- <br>mah of the Lord means the kalimah klj!ii!9. Bu: many <br>con~mentators are of the opinion that it means the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(4) \t Allah will confirm those who believe in words that <br>stand firm, in this world and in the Hereafter, and <br>Allah sends wrong doers astray. Allah does what He <br>wills. <br>Hadhrat Baraa (Radhiyallaho anho) stated that Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"At the time of <br>interrogation in the grave, a Muslim bears witness to <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>and this is meant by the words (firm statement) in this ayat. <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) also corroborated <br>that it refers to the interrogation in the grave. Hadhrat Ibn <br>Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"When a Muslim is about <br>to die, the angels come to him, greet him, and convey the <br>glad tidings of paradise; after his death, they accompany <br>him and join his funeral prayer; and after he is buried, they <br>make him sit up when, in the grave, questioning starts. He <br>replies <br>'I bear witness that there is nobody worthy of worship <br>except Allah. and I bear witness that Muhammad is the <br>messenger of Allah.' <br>'I'his is what is implied in this ayat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Qataadah. (Radhiyallaho anho) also said <br>that c+ujh <br>(firm statement) refers to the Kalimah <br>'I'avyibah in this life. and the interrogation in the grave <br>after dcath. Hadhrat Taa'oos (Kahmatullah alaih) also gave <br>the same interpretation. <br>(5) \t Unto Him is the real praver. Those unto whom they <br>prav besides Allah responds to them not at all. Thev <br>are like those who stretch forth their hands for water to <br>reach their mouths but it reaches them not. The praver <br>of clisbelie\\lers goes astray. <br>Note: According to 1-jadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) as <br>well as Ibn Abbas (Radhi!lallaho anho) and Inanv others, <br>the words ;$I +(propagation of truth) means this kalimah. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>L<br>f <br>I <br>I <br>1 <br><br>L <br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>8 7 <br>(6) \t Say: 0,people of scriptures!

The same view-point has been categorically con- <br>firmed by Hadhrat Abu Aaliyah and Hadhrat Mujahid <br>(Rahmatullah alaitiima). <br>> <br>(7) \t You are the best of people, evolved for mankind, en- <br>joining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and be- <br>lieving in Allah.

Lo! good deeds annul i l l  <br>deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. <br>The \texpla~lation of this sacred avat is to be found in <br>maliy ahaatlith ac:cording to whic:h Kasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasnll;lnl) while refering to this ayat had said that <br>good cieeds wipe out the sins from one's acc:ount. l-iadhrat <br>Abu Zar (Katlhi!lallaho rt~iho) says that he had once re-<br>quested Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give <br>him some advice and Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>lam) replied, \"Hold Almighty Allah in constant fear. If per- <br>chalice you commit anv sin. hasten at once to do some vir- <br>tuous deed so that the sin is atoned, and it is written off.\" <br>'Then Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) continues to say that he <br>asked Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if this kali- <br>mah <br>I <br>was also counted amongst the virtues. <br>At this, Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave the <br>replv that this kalimah is the highest of all virtues. It is <br>likewise quoted from Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said <br>\"Whosover, any time during the day or night, recites the <br>kalimah <br>I <br>! <br>. his sins are washed off his ac-<br>count.\" <br>(9) \t (a) Lo! Allah enjoineth justice and kindness and <br>giving to kinsfolk. He forbids shameful deeds, in- <br>justice and rebellion. He instructs you in order <br>that you take heed. <br>There are different versions regarding the interpreta- <br>tion of the word <br>2-i; <br>(justice). In one version, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that <br>?L <br>(justice) means to believe that nobody is worthy of worship <br>except Allah, while <br>J <br>(goodness) means to do <br>one's obligations to Allah. <br>(10)0,you who believe! Fear Allah and say words straight <br>to the point, that He may make your conduct sound <br>and forgive your sins. Whosoever obeys Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he has attained <br>the highest achievement. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas and Hadhrat Ikramah <br>(Radhiyallaho anhuma) are both said to have been of the <br>view that the meaning of <br>L Y <br>I <br>, <br>(and speak words <br>straight to the right) is to recite the <br>I <br>kalimah. <br>According to one hadith, three things constitute the best of <br><br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>all actions. The first is to do zikr of Allah under all circum- <br>stances, in happiness and in grief, in poverty and in afflu- <br>ence; the second is to conduct oneself with impartiality <br>even when one's own interests are involved; and the third <br>is to help one's brother with money. <br>(11)Give good tidings to my servants, who hear advice and <br>follow the best thereof. Such are those whom Allah <br>guideth, and such are men of understanding. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'eed bin Zaid, Hadhrat Abu Zar Ghifaari and Hadhrat <br>'b<br>Salmaan Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho), all the three, used to <br>~l 2 <br>L <br>recite the kalimah <br>I <br>even before they em-<br>5EN <br>braced Islaam, and by the words <br>I <br>I <br>(the best ut- <br>terance) what is exactly meant in thls sacred ayat is this <br>kalimah. Hadhrat Zaid bin Aslam (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>also said that this ayat relftes to three persons who used to <br>recite the kalimah <br>I <br>Y A <br>even in their days of ig- <br>norance, and they were Hadhrat Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail, <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar Ghifaari and Hadhrat Salmaan Faarsi <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum). <br>(12)He who brings the true thing and He who confirms it; <br>such are the dutiful. They shall have all they wish <br>from their Lord's bounty. Such is the reward of those <br>who do good. <br>The persons who brought the message from Almighty <br>Allah are the Prophets (Alaihimus salaatu was salaam) and <br>the people who brought a message from Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) are the Ulama (May Allah accept <br>their efforts). Hadhrat lbn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is <br>stated \\o Fave said that \"the true thing'' means the kali- <br>mah <br>AIY!a19 <br>. According to some commentators, the <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>words Z L ' l i  ;& 2-i\" (one who brought the true message <br>froni Allah) refers to Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and the words <br>(those who confirmed it) <br>refer to the believers. <br>(13)In the case of those who say, \"Our Lord is Allah\", and <br>afterwards are steadfast, the angels descend upon them <br>saying, \"Fear not, nor grieve but hear good tidings of <br>the Paradise which you were promised. We are your <br>protecting friends in the life of the world and in the <br>Hereafter. There you will have all that your souls <br>desire, and then vou will have what you pray for. A <br>gift of welcome from the forgiving the Merciful.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that the <br>words cli;Gl2ti, (then remained steadfast) means that they <br>remained steadfast in their belief in the kalimah +t$!d!5!)<br>Hadhrat Ibrahim and Hadhrat Mujahid (Rahmatullah alai- <br>hima) both supported the interpretation \"they stuck to the <br>kalimah (i~u'!ii!J) upto their death, and never indulged in <br>Shirk of any kind\" <br>(14)Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to <br>Allah and doeth righteous deeds and says, \"I am <br>among those who bow in Islaam (the Muslims).\" <br>Hadhrat - Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) said that the <br>words (flllJ!W (invited towards Allah) refers'to the call- <br>ing of <br>&IY!~~!Y, <br>by the muazzin. Aasim bin Hubairah <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) advised, \"After finishing azaan, one <br>should recite <br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah: Allah is the <br>greatest and I am from among the Muslims. <br>(15)Is the reward of goodness ought save goodness? Which <br>is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"The <br>meaning of this ayat is that Allah says, 'Can there be any <br>other reward than Paradise in the Hereafter for one whom I <br>blessed in his worldly life with the recitation of kalimah <br>( i t  j!A$) .\" Hadhrat Ikramah and Hadhrat Hasan (Ra-<br>dhiyallaho anhuma) have also said that the reward of <br>y'! &J)cannot be anything but Paradise. <br>I B  <br>(16)Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Mes- <br>senger and upon the believers and imposed upon them <br>the word of self restraint, for they were entitled to it <br>and worthv of it. <br>(*u)(utterance of piety) in this hadith means kalimah <br>Tayvibah as explained in many narrations. Hadhrat Abu <br>Hurairah and Hadhrat Salama (Radhiyallaho anhuma) <br>quoted Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as having <br>said that it means &J!A!J) . The same view was expressed <br>bv Hadhrat Ubavv bin Kab. Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Umar. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas. Hadhrat Ibn Umar, and many other <br>Sahabas. (Radhivallaho anhum). Ataa Khurasani (Rahma- <br>tullahi alaihi) was of the view that it meant the whole Kali- <br>nlah Tayyibah i.e. <br>i <br>l <br>j <br>~ <br>~ <br>~ <br>i <br>~ Hadhrat<br>~ <br>l <br>~ Ali ~<br>while <br>! <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) .had said that it meant $i kih $ 4 ~  <br>Tirnlizi is stated to have quoted on the authority of Baraa <br>(Rddhivaliaho anho) that this implied: t$A!J <br>. <br>(&', 2 3  3 <br>1(CV)@<br>(17)Those who purify themselves wili prosper. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) has quoted Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said that 21 <br>Virtues of Zikr \t<br>37 i<br>(purified) means he declared his faith i n h  j>;s<br>311 u'! i!Y and <br>gave up idol-worship. According to Hadhrat k a y h (Ra-<br>dhiyallaho anho) 2 3  means he proclaimed b 4!d!J <br>and <br>this also was the viewpoint held by Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>(18)As for him who giveth and is dutiful (towards Allah) <br>and believeth in goodness. Surely we will ease his way <br>unto the state of ease. <br>(JA)(state of ease) means Paradise, because it is <br>Paradise where all kinds of comforts and facilities will be <br>available. Its further elaboration is that Allah will so grace <br>a man as to make good deedseasy for him, which will ex- <br>pedite his entry to Paradise. Many commentators are of the <br>view that the above-mentioned ayat was revealed in favour <br>of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>the word (&I) <br>(good thing) mentioned in this ayat means <br>the kalimah 31j!d!Y) . Hadhrat Abu Abdur Rahmaan Salmi <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also shares this view. Hadhrat <br>Imaam-e-A'zam (Rahmatullah alaih) quoting on the auth- <br>ority of Abu Zubair and Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>explained that (>4 <br>JL)means 'testified 31j~ii!j ', while <br>$.Ac +k means 'refi;teds. <br>(19)He who does a good deed shall have ten times as much <br>to his credit. He who does an evil deed will be <br>awarded according to his evil. No wrong shall be done <br>to them. <br>' ,-,.. <br>It is related when this ayat *kbk <br>3 descended, <br>someone asked Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>the reciting of (bg! A!$ <br>was also counted among their vir- <br>tuous deeds. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) re- <br>plied that it is the best of all virtues. Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Abbaas and Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum) take (b)<br>(virtue) to mean <br>j\\ill% . Hadhrat Abu <br>Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) also holds exactly the same <br>view. Similar meanings were also narrated by Hadhrat Abu <br><br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>i <br>Zar Ghifaari (Radhiyallaho anho) on the authority of Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) who held that @j!i!y)<br>was the best amongst all virtuous deeds. <br>According to Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). one good deed is counted ten times over as a general <br>principle but, for the muhaajirs, compensation for one good <br>deed is raised to seven hundred times. <br>(20)The revelation of this. Book is from Allah, exalted in <br>power, full of knowledge, who forgives sin and accepts <br>repentance, strict in punishment, and hath a long<br>, -<br>resch.

The same interpretation is also related <br>from Sufyaan (Rahmatullah alaih). <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>CONCLUSION: <br>I <br><br>PART 2 <br>This chapter includes such ayaat as contains the Kali- <br>mah Tayyibah in full or in part, or else its equivalent in dif- <br>ferent words but having the same meaning. The Kalimah <br>Tayyibah (&l$d!J) means that nobody is worthy of wor- <br>ship except Allah. The words <br>(;;;i+>r;, <br>and jcj!d!J and <br>(31 J! W)also cany the same meaning. Similarly(i$d! l;irJ) (We <br>do not worship anybody other than Allah) and <br>d! 3 @)<br>(He is the only one worthy of worship) also mean the same <br>thing. There are other similar ayaat, which imply the same <br>meaning as of Kalimah Tayyibah. The surah and ruku in <br>cl<br>which each such ayat occurs has been indicated below. In <br>fact, the whole of the Holy Qur'an is an explanation of the <br>8 &<br>ZN<br>Kalimah Tayyibah, because the basic objective of the Holy <br>Qur'an and of the deen of Islam is towheed. It is to propa- <br>gate towheed that the messengers of Allah were sent to <br>people at different times. Towheed is the common objec- <br>tive of all'the revealed religions, and for this reason the <br>subject of towheed has all along been dealt with under dif- <br>ferent headings to establish its truth. The same towheed is <br>therefore the object of Kalimah Tayyibah. <br>1. \t Your Allah is one Allah.

Say: He is Allah, The One and Only. <br>(Ikhlaas) <br>The above are the eighty five verses, in which text of <br>Kalimah Tayyibah or its equivalent in meaning has oc-<br>curred. There are still many more verses, which equally <br>convey the same sense and meaning of the Kalimah as I <br>have stated in the beginning of this section. Tauheed is the <br>fundamental basis of Deen, and therefore the more ac-<br>quainted a man is with the requirements of Tauheed, the <br>more steadfast he shall be in Deen. Tauheed in the Holy <br>Qur'an has been described from various viewpoints and in <br>various manners and aspects, so that it may penetrate <br>through the very depths of the heart; so it firmly settles <br>there, leaving no room for anything else to enter. <br>I 3<br>~ <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalirnah Tayyabah 107 <br>PART 3 <br>Part 3 includes such ahadith which describe the vir- <br>tues and blessings of reciting Kalimah Tayyibah. In the <br>foregoing we have seen that there is plurality of ayaat on <br>this subject, which goes to prove that the number of aha- <br>dith on this subject must be far more numerous. It is there- <br>fore difficult to record them all here. Only a few illustrative <br>examples will be given here. <br>HadithNo 1 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"of <br>all the azkaar (plural of zikr) the repetition of (&IJ!~IY, <br>is the best, and of all the du'aas (Am'i,is the best.\" <br>- .  <br>That & j ! i ! ~ )is the best of all azkaar is quite evident. It <br>is described as such in many ahadith. In fact when the <br>whole of Deen depends on this Kalimah Tauheed, there <br>can hardly be any doubt that it is the highest of all azkaar. <br>Again (+.a\\)<br>(Alhamdolillah) has been regarded as the best <br>du'aa, because praising one who is the most benevolent <br>person is in fact a form of begging. It is common experience <br>that by writing a eulogy in praise of a man of wealth or of <br>authority does not mean anything else than begging his <br>favours or riches. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that one <br>who recites ( a . u I )  should follow it by hlj!i!y, because in <br>the Holy Qur'an the verse <br>(Ask Allah with sincere devotion) <br>is followed by 91<br>;j i<br>. . Ui (All praise is for Allah Who is <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>the Cherisher of all the universe). <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated: \"There <br>is not the slightest doubt that Kalimah Tayyibah is by far <br>the best and foremost of all azkaar because it is the root and <br>fundamental basis of the Deen and the whole religion of <br>1slam.centres round it. It is for this reason that the Sufis <br>and saints emphasise its importance and prefer it over all <br>other azkaar and advise their followers to practise it as <br>much as possible. Also, actual experience has shown that, <br>the benefits following from Kalimah Tayyibah far out-<br>number those which result from other forms of zikr. <br>There is a well-known story of Sayyid Ali bin May- <br>moon Maghrabi. Once Shaikh Ulwan Hamawi, who himself <br>was a great scholar, Mufti and teacher of his age, came for <br>learning zikr. The Sayyid (Kahmatullah alaih) devoted <br>special attention to him and made hinl give up all his rou- <br>tines, such as teaching and writing fatawa, and to take up <br>zikr all the time. On this, the common people started freely <br>indulging in fault finding and condemnation. They started <br>a campaign of criticism that the Shaikh has now been lost <br>to them and the people were being deprived of his benefits. <br>A few days later, when the Sayyid (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>came to know that Shaikh Ulwan was occasionally reciting <br>the Holy Qur'an, he stopped him from this recitation also. <br>At this, the people lost all sense and openly accused the <br>Sayyid, (Rahmatullah alaih), of irreligiousness and perver- <br>sion. After some time, when the Shaikh observed that the <br>zikr has had its effect on his heart, the Sayyid (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) allowed him to resume recitation of the Holy <br>Qur'an. When he opened the Book, every word and aavat <br>emerged with new meanings and significance he never <br>thought of before. The Sayyid (Rahmatullah alaih) then <br>told Shaikli lqamawi that he had not forbidden him from <br>recitation, but in fact he had desired to develop in him <br>spiritual awareness, which was a pre-requisite for this reci- <br>tation of the Qur'an. <br>As this Holy Kalimah constitutes the fundamental <br>basis of religion and the root of Imaan (faith), the greater <br>the devotion to this Kalimah. the more firmly will Imaan be <br>rooted. lmaan depends on this Kalimah, and the very exist- <br>ence of this world depends on it. According to a hadith, the <br>Day of Judgment will not dawn as long as there exists on <br>Earth a single man reciting the Kalimah b Y\\ dry. This is re- <br>ported in other ahadith also. So long as there lives a single <br>I <br><br>Ch. II: Ahadith on.Virtues of Kalimah I'ayyabah <br>man on Earth who remembers Almighty Allah, Qiyaamat <br>(Doomsday) will not take place. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: \"Once the prophet Moosa (Alayhis salaam) <br>prayed to Almighty Allah to teach him some forms of <br>zikr for his remembrance. He was advised to recite (bj!i!J,. <br>He submitted: '0 my Lord! this zikr is recited by all <br>the creation. Again came the reply: \"Recite 31i!&Y .\" <br>He submitted: '0 my Sustainer, I want something <br>special, exclusively meant for me.\" Then Almighty <br>Allah said: 'If the seven heavens and the seven earths <br>were placed in one pan of the Balance, and the Kali- <br>mah <br>i!d!4 in the other, the latter will outweigh the <br>former.\" <br>It is the usual way of Almighty Allah that what is re- <br>quired most is provided most. The more pressing the need <br>for a thing, the more plentiful is the provision for the same. <br>> <br>Looking at the most essential necessities of life, such as <br>breathing. water and air, it will be observed that Almighty <br>Allah has created them in great abundance. It is, however. <br>Ikhlaas (purity of intention) that determines the value of <br>things in the eye of Almighty Allah. The greater the Ikhlaas <br>in an action the greater will be its weight and, likewise. <br>less the Ikhlaas and devotion, the lesser the weight. For the <br>attainment of this Ikhlaas, nothing is more effective than <br>this Kalimah. That is why it is also known as purifier of <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>hearts (<br>1 s*) <br>. For its purifying effect, Sufis prescribe zikr <br>of this Kalimah and advise its recitation as a daily routine, <br>not only in hundreds but in thousands of times. Mulla Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that a disciple once com- <br>plained to his Shaikh that, despite doing zikr, his heart re- <br>mained inattentive. The Shaikh replied: \"Go on with your <br>zikr firmly, and thank Almighty Allah for His Grace that He <br>enabled a part of your body. i.e. the tongue, to remain busy <br>in His zikr, and pray to Allah for a devoted heart.\" A simi- <br>lar incident is related in Ihyaa-ul Uloom about Abu Usman <br>I<br>Maghribi, who gave the same reply on a similar con~plaint <br>made by one of his disciples, and he prescribed the same <br>cure. As a matter of fact, zikr is the best remedy for indo- <br>lence of the heart. Almighty Allah says in His Book, \"If you <br>show gratitude to Me, I will grant even more than before.\" <br>Likewise the hadith says \"zikr of Almighty Allah is a great <br>blessing; and be thankful to Him in as much as He has en- <br>abled you to do His zikr.\" <br>Hadith No 3 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) once en- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>to who would be most benefitted by his intercession <br>on the Day, of Resurrection. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Knowing your anxiety for <br>the Urn (knowledge) of ahadith, I could expect that <br>I <br>none other than you would have asked this question <br>earlier.\" Thereafter the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) told Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>the most blessed or the most benefitted by my interces- <br>sion will be the person who proclaims (31y'!j!y, with <br>Ikhlaas (sincerity). <br>The meaning of good fortune here is to get something <br>good through the Grace of Allah. That the person reciting <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 111 <br>the Kalimah with Ikhlaas Miil be most deserving to be ben- <br>efitted by the intercession of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, such a <br>person could be one who has just embraced Islaam with <br>sincerity of heart, and has done no other good deed except <br>the recitation of the Kalimah. Evidently he can be helped <br>only by virtue of this intercession, because he has no deed <br>to his credit. In this case, this hadith is corroborated by <br>other ahadith, in which it is stated that the intercession <br>will be for those guilty of major sins who shall have been <br>sent to the Hell because of their sins, but by virtue of their <br>recitation of the Kalimah Tayyibah they will be released <br>through the intercession of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). Secondly, the most deserving people to be ben- <br>efitted will be those who continually recite this Kalimah <br>with sincerity and they have to their credit other good <br>'8 <br>deeds as well. Being most fortunate means that they will be <br>8 & <br>benefitted more than by anything else by the intercession <br>%z <br>of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in raising their <br>a <br>status in Paradise. <br>Allama Ainee (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), will intercede in six <br>different ways on the Day of Judgement, Firstly, it will be <br>for relief from the intolerable distress and supense in the <br>field of judgement, where all the people will be afflicted in <br>various ways and will even prefer to be sent to Hell so that <br>their present worries may come to an end. They will go to <br>all the high-ranking Prophets, one by one, and beg them to <br>intercede before Almighty Allah, but none of them will <br>dare to do so. At last, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) will intercede, and this intercession will be in favour <br>of all the people, including Jinn and mankind, believers <br>and non-beliyers, all of whom will be benefitted by it, as <br>explained in detail in the ahadith describing the Resurrec- <br>tion. Secondly, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>will intercede for mitigation of punishment to some non- <br>believers, as mentioned in the hadith about Abu Talib. <br>Thirdly, his intercession will be for the release from Hell of <br>some of the Believers who have been thrown in there. <br>Fourthly, it will be for the pardon from Hell of some Be- <br>lievers, who on account of their misdeed have deserved to <br>be condemned to it. Fifthly, it will be in favour of some Be- <br>lievers for their admittance into Paradise, without requiring <br>them to render account of their deeds. Sixthly, it will be for <br>raising the status of the Believers in general. <br>Virtues of Z'ikr <br>HadithRo 4 <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>I <br>I<br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho -alaihe wasallam) had said <br>that one who recites (31j!d!9) with Ikhlaas will enter <br>Paradise. Somebody asked what was the sign of Ikh- <br>laas. He explained that it prevents one from indulging <br>in the forbidden things. <br>It is apparent that one w h ~ ,  <br>abs,tains from the forbidden <br>things and professes faith in 41g! 93 , will directly be ad- <br>mitted into the Paradise. But if one has indulged in some <br>forbidden things and has been sent to Hell, even then <br>through the blessing of this Kalimah he will, certainly <br>someday, after undergoing punishment for his misdeeds, <br>be transferred to Paradise. But if his misdeeds have led him <br>to stray out of the fold of Islaam and Imaan, he will <br>remain condemned in the Hell for ever. <br>Faqih' Abul Laith of Samarkand has written in his <br>book Tanbeeh-ul-Ghaafileen, \"It is imperative for every- <br>body to hymn (31J ! ~ ! J )often, and also pray to Almighty <br>Allah for steadfastness in Imaan, and abstain from sins; be- <br>cause there are many people whose sinful deeds destroy <br>their Imaan and they die as non-believers. There can be no <br>tragedy greater than that a man should be listed as a <br>Muslim throughout his life, but on the Day of Resurrection <br>his name should appear in the list of non-believers. This is <br>indeed the greatest misfortune. One does not feel sorry for <br>a person who has throughout worshipped in a church or a <br>temple and in the Hereafter is listed among the non-believ- <br>ers, but it is a matter of great grief that he who had re-<br>mained in the musjid should be counted as one of the non- <br>believers. This happens, as a result of excessive sinning <br>and secret indulgence in forbidden things. For instance, a <br>person gets unlawful possession of something knowingly, <br>but he consoles his conscience that he will restore it some <br>day to its real owner, or will get it condoned by him, but he <br>happens to die before he is able to do anything of the sort. <br>There are some who divorce their wives, but even then, <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>knowingly, they continue to cohabit with them, till death <br>overtakes them. In such cases, one does not get a chance of <br>doing Taubah (repentance) and consequently is completely <br>deprived of his Imaan. May Almighty Allah save us from <br>this! <br>L,,.&& $\\ <br>In the books of Hadith, the story of a young man who <br>was unable to recite the Kalimah, when his end was near, <br>is related. It was brought to the notice of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), who went to the young man and <br>asked him what was the matter with him. He replied that <br>he felt as if his mind was locked. On enquiry, it transpired <br>that his mother was angry with him because of his mis- <br>behaviour. She was called by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and when she came, he said to her: \"If some-<br>ZG<br>body kindles a big fire and wants to throw your son into it, <br>will you recommend mercy for him?\" \"I will certainly do <br>so\", she replied. \"If it is so, then forgive his sin\", said Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At this she pardoned <br>her son, and thereafter when the young man was asked to <br>recite the Kalimah he readily did so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) thanked Almighty Allah that, through his <br>effort, the man was saved from the fire of Hell. There are <br>hundreds of cases, like the one mentioned above, where <br>the evil effect of the sins in which we get involved results <br>in our worldly as well as spiritual loss. <br>The worthy author of Ihya-ul-Uloom has related that <br>once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ge1,ivered a <br>sermon, in which he said: \"One who recites (dl Y! d!J, , in <br>the manner that he does not mix it up,rhe becomes entitled <br>to Paradise.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) asked for the <br>clarification of the meaning of mixing it up. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"It is to love the worldly <br>life and hanker after it. There are many who talk like the <br>Prophets, but act like the arrogant people and tyrants. If <br>one recites this Kalimah while not indulging in anything of <br>this sort, he becomes entitled to Paradise.\" <br>Hadith No.5 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"There is <br>nobody who may recite (A1 g!qY) and the doors of the <br>Heavens do not get opened to allow this Kaliinah to <br>reach the Arshi Ilaahi (Allah's throne), provided he <br>abstains from the major sins.\" <br>The extreme excellence and acceptability of this Kali- <br>mah is proved by its going straight to the Arshi Ilaahi <br>(throne of Allah). It has already been stated that its recita- <br>tion, even with major sins, is not without benefit. Muila Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the condition of being <br>free from major sins is the key to quick acceptance and for <br>the opening of all the doors of Heaven; otherwise the reci- <br>tation of Kalimah is not without reward and acceptance, in <br>spite of ma'or sins. Some scholars have explained this <br>hadith to me \\n that, after the death of such a person, all the <br>doors of the Heavens are opened to welcome his soul. <br>According to another hadith, two Kalimahs are such that <br>one does not stop before reaching the Throne of Allah. and <br>the other fills the Heaven and Earth with its light or <br>reward: one is (&I Y'! ii14, and the other is(31g!31$. <br>HadithNo.6 <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahudith on Vjrlues of Kalin~ahl ' ~ ~ , y u b u h115<br>i <br>Hadhrat Shaddaad (Kadhiyallaho anho) relates. while <br>Hadhrat Ubaadah (Radhiyallaho anho) confirms, that <br>once we were sitting with Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and he asked if there was any stranger (non- <br>Muslim) in the gathering. We submitted that there was <br>none. He then had the door ~ l 9 s e d  and asked us to <br>raise our harids and recite (ir~Y!il!J).We raised our <br>hands for somf: time and recited the Kalimah. He then <br>exclaimed &y!iJ!J, anti said: ''0 Allah! You have sent <br>me with this Kalimah. You have prorrlised paradise for <br>$ <br>v, r-<br>those who profess it, and Your promise never remains <br>unfulfilled.\" Then he turned to us and said: \"Be <br>$3 <br>happy, Allah has blessed you with His forgiveness.\" <br>$ <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had made sure <br>that no stranger was present there, and he had got the <br>door closed, because presumably he had every hope <br>that those particular people would be forgiven by <br>virtue of reciting the Kalimah, and he had no such <br>hope in respect of non-believers.\" <br>The Sufis quote this hadith as an argument for making <br>their disciples engage in zikr collectively. it is stated in <br>Jaarni-ul-[Jsool that there were instances when Rasulullah <br>(Sallallahc alaihe wasallam) made his companions do zikr <br>collectively and individually, and this I-fadith is quoted as <br>authority for doing zikr collectively. In that case, the clos- <br>ing of the door would be to help those present to concen- <br>trate their attention. 'The enquiry about the presence of any <br>stranger might also be for the same purpose: it may not <br>have distracted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>but there was likelihood of others getting distracted. <br>Hadith No. 7 <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Keep on <br>renewing your Imaan. \"0Rasulullah! Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam, how should we renew our Imaan?\" enquired <br>the Sahabah. \"Recite &i!ii!J, <br>very often\", was the <br>reply. <br>Note: <br>In one hadith. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihs wasallam) <br>is reported to have said. \"Like old clothes, the Imaan also <br>gets worn out, hence keep on renewing it through supplica- <br>tion to Almighty Allah.\" That the Imaan gets old and worn <br>out means that it loses strength and radiance on account of <br>sins. Thus it is stated in one hadith that, when a man com- <br>mits h sin. a dark spot appears on his heart. If he then does <br>sincere l'aubah (repentance), this spot gets washed away. <br>otherwise it remains there. When he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears on the heart. Thus, on account of <br>further sins, the black dots continue to increase, till ulti- <br>mately the heart is all blackened and rusted, as decribed in <br>the Qur'an in Surah Tatfeef.\" <br>b* <br>lJgc &$ * blj *<br>< -<br>Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon <br>their hearts. <br>When such a stage is reached, then th,: heart is no <br>longer influenced by words. It is said in o1.d hadith, \"Four <br>things cause ruination of the heart. namely, debating with <br>stupid people, excessive sinning, excessive mixing with <br>women, and remaining in the society of the dead.\" Some- <br>body enquired, \"What is meant by the dead in this case?\" <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallarrl) explained that it <br>meant such wealthy persons who assume arrogance on ac- <br>count of their wealth. <br>Hadith No. 8 <br>.. -. <br>J <br>,;,*,, <br>.<br>1;\"~ <br>3 (A) <br>0 3 9  <br>Li <br>,&<br>q1<br>&,<br>$<br>ii<br>JG<br>&<br>Gj <br>,<br>2 15 &> &? > L L  & ?\\ +> <br>, <br><br>I <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kulirnuh 'I'uyyubuh <br>I <br>l$as,u13ullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"Recite <br>Y!il!jij very often, before the time of death comes <br>when'you will not be able to say it.\" <br>Note: <br>It means that no deed is possible after death. This life <br>is very short, but it is the only time for action and for <br>sowing the seeds. This life after death is infinitely long. <br>and we will there reap whatever we have sown here. <br>Hadith No. 9 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I know <br>of a Kalimah, such that if anybody recites it with sin- <br>cerity of belief in it and then dies. Hell becomes forbid- <br>den for him. This Kalimah is (3t j!ii~y,.'' <br>Note: <br>This subject matter has been related in many ahadith. <br>If the person referred to in the above hadith has been a new <br>convert to Islam, then there can be no doubt about the <br>meaning, because it is unanimously agreed that on embrac- <br>ing Islaam all the sins committed as a non-Muslim are for- <br>given. But if it refers to an old Muslim, who recites the <br>Kalimah with sincerity just before his death, even then it is <br>hoped that Almighty Allah, through His sheer Grace, may <br>forgive all his sins. Almighty Allah has Himself said that <br>He mav forgive whomsoever He likes, all his sins, except <br>Shirk. <br>, <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that <br>some scholars are of the view that these ahadith pertain to <br>the very earlv period of lslaam when detailed command- <br>merits had not yet been revealed. Some scholars have <br>stated that the hadith implies declaration of this Kalimah <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I<br>with proper discharge of one's obligations enjoined by it, as <br>given under Hadith No 4 above. Hasan Basri (Ratlmatullah <br>alaih) and many others also held the same view. According <br>to the considered view of Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) Allah's promise holds good if the declaration of the <br>Kalimah before death is with repentance, which is the es- <br>sence of Taubah while, according to Mulla Ali Qari, the re- <br>citer will not be doomed to Hell-for ever. Moreover, it is a <br>matter of common observation that sometimes the inherent <br>quality of a thing becomes ineffective due to some counter- <br>force. For instance, a purgative may become ineffective if it <br>is followed by a strong constipative drug, but that does not <br>mean that the purgative has become devoid of its inherent <br>effect; it has only not worked because of the strong counter- <br>acting agent. <br>Hadith No 10 <br>Kalimah itself is made up of two parts. one $1 jjig, and the <br>other i1J>;G.<br>Thus. the Paradise may be said to open <br>with these two keys. In these ahadith, wherever the Kali- <br>mah is stated to cause entry into Paradise or protection <br>against Hell, it means the complete Kalimah comprising <br>both the parts. In one hadith. it is said that the price of Par- <br>adise is ($1 u'~ii14. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Profes- <br>sing faith in <br>j!d!~,provides the keys to Paradise.\" <br>Note: <br>The Kalimah has been described as the keys of Para- <br>dise, because it serves as the key for opening every door <br>and every part of Paradise; therefore, the Kalimah consti- <br>tutes all the keys. Or else, it is called the keys, because the <br><br>I <br>Ch. 11: Ahudjth on irirtues of Kc~lirnuh'I'u!.\\'abnh<br>I <br>Hadith No 11 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"1Vhoso- <br>ever recites 3,ii!W, any time during day or night. his sins <br>are remitted from his account and virtues are written <br>instead.\" <br>Note: <br>The replacement of sins by virtues has been fully de- <br>scribed under Hadith No 10 of Chapter 1, part 2, where <br>various meanings of all the aayats and ahadith of this kind <br>are given. According to every version, this hadith categori- <br>cally states that sins are washed away from the account of a <br>person's deeds, provided there is Ikhlaas, that is sincerity <br>of intention. In any case, hymning the blessed name of <br>Al!ah and excessive recitation of Kalimah Tayyibah also <br>develops Ikhlans. That is why this blessed Kalimah is also <br>called the Kalimah of Ikhlaas.\" <br>Hadith No. 12 <br>I., <br>2 <br>&j i&,L hi 2 (\\r) <br>'$1 <br>jo.a.o & L\\ JG f<br>J <br>J. - , * <br>JG \\;$ 2$\\d4 $t4J 2 1 5 2<br>&, j$<br>?+!<br>u,;<br>;$., <br>&\\ .j! i!q <br>, f ,  <br>J$<br>j.$ <br>,$q $2, $i &$<br>-<br>,<br>Juj JjS6<br>;&Wa&>& <br>9 <br># <br>$,\\ <br>.-<br>J ,,r.gp 4) GyJ'j <br>.<br>1s4 p, ~h\"<br>o ' u<br>~ j , 4 + ~ ~ w<br>j 2 d ~ L r , i l i J ~ t - s t r n ~ ~ ~ i ~ ~ b l ~ ~<br>bl+ d <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"There is <br>a pillar of Noor (Divine Light) in front of the Arshi llanhi <br>(the Throne of Allah).

'How can I stop, when the reciter of <br>the Kalimah has not yet been granted forgiveness?' <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Thereupon Allah says: 'Well, I have forgiven him', and <br>then that pillar stops shaking.\" <br>Note: <br>I <br>Some scholars of hadith have doubted authenticity of <br>this hadith, but Allanla Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>written that this hadith (tradition) in different words has <br>been narrated through many sources. According to some <br>narrations. Almighty Allah also says, \"I have made him <br>utter the Kalimah in order that I may grant him forgive- <br>ness.\" How kind and benevolent is Almighty Allah that He <br>himself graces a person with the power to do this virtuous <br>act, and then grants pardon on this basis to complete His <br>extreme favour. In this connection a story told about Hadh- <br>rat Atna (Rahmatullah alaih) is well known. He once hap- <br>pened to go to the market where a woman lunatic slave was <br>on sale. He purchased her. At midnight she got up, per- <br>formed her ablution. and began offering Salaat. During her <br>prayers she wept so profusely that her breath was getting <br>:<br>choked. Then she said: \"0 my Lord! in the name of the <br>love that You have for me, bestow Your Mercy on me.\" <br>Hearing this. Ataa said \"0,slave woman, say: '0Allah, in <br>the name of the love that I have for YOU:\" Upon hearing <br>this she got upset and said, \"By Allah! If He had not loved <br>me, He would not have let you sleep and made me to stand <br>I <br>in prayer as you see!\" Then she recited the following <br>couplets: <br>My restlessness is increasing, and my heart is burning; <br>patience has forsaken me, and my tears are flowirlg. How <br>can one have peace of mind, when one is all upset by the <br>pangs of love and restlessness. 0 Allah! if there is anything <br>which can help me to get rid of my grief, please bestow it <br>upon me as a favour! Then she said, '0 Allah! so far the <br>deal between You and me was known to none,.since it has <br>ceased to be secret now, take me away from here. Saying <br>this, she uttered a shriek and breathed her last. There have <br>been many other incidents like this. It is a fact that only <br>Almighty Allah grants the power to do good. <br><br>Ch. II: Ahucf~fhon \\.'irI~~esol Kulimclh 'l'uj,~u0trh <br>(And if Allah, the Sustainer of the Universe does not <br>will it, you cannot even wish for anything). <br>Hadith No 13 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>Y will neither have fear in <br>\"Those who believe in k~Y! <br>the grave nor on the Day of Resurrection. It is as if I see <br>the spectacle when they 'will rise from their graves, <br>wiping dust from their heads and saying: 'All praise is <br>for Allah, who has cast off (for good) all worry and fear <br>from us. \" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>It is stated in another hadith that those who profess <br>At d! ii!J will experience no affliction at the time of death or <br>in the grave. <br>Note: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Once <br>Hazrat Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) came to Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam): Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was very much worried, and Jibraa-eel said: <br>'Almighty Allah has sent His salaam to you and has en- <br>quired why you look so sad and worried!\" Although Allah <br>knows whatever is hidden in the hearts, yet by such <br>enquiries Allah means to indicate honour, respect and <br>favours. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, <br>\"0 Jibraa-eel! I am worried about my Ummat, as to how <br>they will (fare) on the Day of Judgement!\" \"Is it about the <br>non-believers or about the Muslims?\" asked Jibraa-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam). \"About the Muslims,\" replied the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Jibraa-eel (Alayhis <br>salaam) then took the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>along to a graveyard where the people of the tribe of Banu <br>Salama were buried; there he struck a grave with his wing <br>><br>. <br>and said <br>,\u2018A b <br>(stand up by the orders of Allah). <br>Out of that grave', an extremely handsome man stood up, <br>and he was reciting <br>Hadhrat Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) told him to go back to <br>his place, which he did. Then he struck another grave with <br>his wing. Out of it stood up an extremely ugly person with <br>black face and worried eyes, who was saying, \"Alas, there <br>is nothing but sorrow, shame and horror!\" Hadhrat Jibraa- <br>eel (Alayhis salaam) told him to go back to his place, and <br>then explained to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"The people will rise up on the Day of Resurrection in the <br>same state that they were at the time of their death.\" <br>In this hadith, the people of if<br>g!ii!Y apparently imply <br>those who have close attachment for and remain busy with <br>this Kalimah, just as milkman, shoeman, pearl ma^ and <br>iceman rnean those who deal in and especially stock those <br>particular things. Thus, there is no doubt whatsoever that <br>the people of this Kalimah, will receive this extraordinary <br><br>Ch. 11: AIi(~ditho n  Virl lies oJ'lic~limclh 'l'tryyc~l)c~h 123<br>treatment. In Surah Faatir of the Holy Qur'an, three catego- <br>ries of this Ummat have been described; one category is <br>named al&bckL. <br>(leaders in virtues), about whom it is <br>stated in a hadith that they will enter Paradise without anv <br>reckoning. According to one hadith, a person who recites <br>AI y~ y one hundred times daily will on the Dav of Resur- <br>rection be raised up with his face shining like the full <br>moon. Madhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that those whose tongues remain busy in the zikr of Allah <br>will enter Paradise rejoicing. <br>Hadith No. 14 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) siid. \"On <br>the Day of Judgement, Almighty Allah will select a <br>man from my Ummat and will call him in the-presenc;~ <br>of all mankind, and then 99 registers of his n1isdt:eds. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>each register as long as one can see, will be opened <br>before him. He will then be asked if he denies anything <br>recorded in his account of deeds, or whether the angels <br>who were appointed to record his deeds had been <br>unjust to him in any respect. He will reply in the nega- <br>tive (i.e. he will neither deny anything nor blame the <br>angels for any injustice to him). Then Allah will ask <br>him if he can justify his misdeeds, but he will submit <br>that he has no excuse to offer. Then Allah will say <br>'Well, there is indeed one virtue to your credit. Today <br>no injustice will be done to you.' Then a small piece of <br>I<br>paper with the Kalimah <br>written on it will be handed over to him, and he will <br>be asked to go and get it weighed. He will subniit that <br>this small piece of paper will be of little avail as <br>against so many lengthy registers. Allah will say, \"This <br>day, no injustice will be done to you.\" Then all the <br>registers will be placed in one pan and the piece of <br>paper in the other pan. The pan with the registers will <br>fly up in the air on account of the excessive weight of <br>that piece of paper. The fact is that nothing is weight- <br>ier than the name of Allah.\" <br>Note: <br>It is a blessed result of Ikhlaas that a single recitation, <br>with sincerity, of Kalimah Tayyibah can outweigh all the <br>misdeeds recorded in so manv registers. It is, therefore, <br>necessarv that one should not look down upon anv Muslim <br>and think oneself as superior to him. Who knows that <br>Almighty Allah may accept from him some deeds that may <br>sutfice for his redemption, while nobody can be sure about <br>himself whether any of his own deeds will be found <br>worthy of acceptance. There is related in one hadith the <br>story of two persons belonging to Bani Israa-eel. One of <br>whom was worshipper and the other was a sinner. The <br>worshipper always criticised the latter, who used to reply: <br>\"LeCive me to my Creator.\" One day, the worshipper, in a <br>fit of anger, said: 'By Allah! you will never be forgiven.' <br>Almighty Allah assembled them unto His presence and <br>pardoned the sinner because he alwavs expected n1err:y <br>from Him. but ordered purlishment for the worshipper due <br><br>I <br>i <br>to his swearing upon Allah. No doubt, the oath was serious <br>and offended against the declaration of Allah in the verse <br>(Almightv Allah will not forgive Kufr and Shirk but ex- <br>cepting that. He may forgive any sin as He may like). None <br>else has the right to say that a certain person will not be <br>forgiven, but this does not mean that we should not warn <br>others against sins and undesirable things, and ask others <br>to desist from these. At hundreds of places in the Holy <br>Qur'an and in the books of hadith. there are warnings <br>against not forbidding from evil. It is stated in many aha-<br>dith that the people who see a sin being committed and do <br>not stop it. in spite of their having power to do so, will also <br>co <br>v,<br>share the punishment for that sin. This point has been dis- <br>cussed by me in detail in mv book. Fazaaile Tabligh. which <br>$ <br>can be consulted if desired. There is, moreover. a note of <br>caution. Whereas it is verv wrong to condemn sinful Mus- <br>lims as absolute dwellers of Hell, it is even more dangerous <br>on the part of ignorant people to accept anv person as their <br>spiritual guide, in spite of his being devoid of good prac- <br>tices and his saving senseless and un-Islamic words. Kasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: \"Whosoever <br>respects an innovator in Islam is c:onsideretl to have taken <br>part in dt:niolishing Islam.\" It is stated in several ahi~clith <br>that in tilnes to come, there will appear Inany imposters. <br>cheats and liars. who will relate ahadith that vou will tlavtt <br>never heard before.

It admits of no doubt that nothing can be equal to the <br>blessed name of Allah. It is really a great misfortune and <br>deprivation for those who take it lighty. However, the <br>weight of this Kalimah is proportional to the Ikhlaas with <br>which it is uttered. The greater the Ikhlaas, the weightier <br>becomes the Kalimah. It is to cultivate this Ikhlaas that one <br>has to remain in the service of the Sufis. According to one <br>hadith, the above-mentioned saying of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was in connection with another sub- <br>ject matter. He has said: \"Persuade a dying person to recite <br>(81j!ii~$because he who recites this Kalimah at the time of <br>his death gets entitled to enter Paradise.\" The Sahaba en- <br>quired: \"0 Rasulullah! (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) what <br>about reciting it during good health?\" He replied, \"Then it <br>is even more effective in obtaining entitlement to Para- <br>dise,\" and then stated, on oath, the hadith related above. <br>Hadith No.16 <br>I <br>I <br>There came to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>three non-Muslims who said to him: \"0Muhammad! (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) don't you recognise anybody, <br>except Allah as worthy of worship?\" In reply, Rasulullah <br>(Sallsllaho alaihe wasallam) recited (LIj~j~j,(Nobody is <br>worth\" of worship except Allah), and gdded: \"I have been <br>deputed spscifically for the propagation of this Kalimah, <br><br>Cli. 11: Ali(~dithon Virtues of Kulimuh 'I'ayyabuh 127 <br>and to it I invite al!*manktnd.\" It was in this connection <br>that the verse LW Yi*;i,ji 4 [What thing is ob most weight <br>in testimony) was reve'aled.\" <br>Note: <br>The words of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>namely, \"I have been deputed (as a prophet) specifically <br>for the propagation of this Kalimah, and to it I invite all <br>mankind\" did not mean that only he had been sent on this <br>special mission. In fact, all the Prophets had been deputed <br>for the propagation of this Kalimah, and all of them had in- <br>vited mankind to it. From Aadam (Alayhis salaam) to Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) the last and the best of <br>Prophets, there was not a single prophet who had not <br>propagated this sublime Kalimah. So blessed and sublime <br>*I<br>is this Kalimah, that all the Prophets and all true religions <br>propagated it, and served its cause. In fact, every true relig- <br>ion is based on this Kalimah. It is in support of this Kali- .EN <br>mah that the Qur'anic verse <br>(Y <br>cb~,,ijp$1 '2213 has <br>been revealed, in which Almighty Allah is a witness in <br>favour of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Accord- <br>ing to one hadith, when somebody recites &+!& then <br>Almighty Allah testifies to it and says: \"My slave has <br>spoken the truth; there is nobody worthy of worship except <br>I.\" <br>Hadith No.17 <br>The Prophet Eesa (Jesus) (Alayhis salaam) had said: <br>The deeds of the Ummat of Hadhrat Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) would be reckoned weight- <br>iest, on the Day of Judgement, because their tongues <br>are accustomed to the recitation of a Kalimah, which <br>was found too hard by the Um~nats of other Prophets, <br>and this Kalimah is 51+I i i ~ y .  <br>Note: <br>It is a fact that the Umrnat of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is devoted particularlv to this Kalimah, <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>far more than any other Ummat. There have been hundreds <br>of thousands. nay millions of Sufis (divine persons) every <br>one of whom had hundreds of disciples, all of whom re- <br>cited the Kalimah thousands of times daily as a matter of <br>routine. It is stated in the book 'Jaami-ul-Usool' that the <br>word 'Allah' should be repeated a minimum number of five <br>I <br>thousand times daily alid that there is no upper limit for <br>this, and the Sufis are required to repeat <br>yl j,y, dailv at <br>least twenty five thousand times. This number varies <br>ac:c:ording to the advice of the Mashaaikh. I have related all <br>this in support of the above saying of Hadhrat Eesa (Jesus) <br>stated in his book al-Qowlul jameel that his father as a be- <br>gill~ier in Sufism used to recite ( ~ I Y IJIY, two hundred times <br>in one breath. <br>(Alavhis salaam). Shah Waliullah (Kahmatullah alaih) has <br>Shaikh Abu Yazeed Qurtubi (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: <br>learning that one who recites ,81i1ii!J, seventy thou- <br>\"011 <br>salid times becomes safe from the fire of Hell. I completed <br>this number once for my wife and then several times for <br>my own self as a provision for the Hereafter. There used to <br>live near us a voung man who was known to be blessed <br>with the power of Kashf (divine manifestation of unseen <br>thing). even in respect of Paradise and tiell. but I hesitated <br>to believe it.:Once when this voung inan was tiining with <br>us. lie uttered a cry of agony. his breatlii~ig bec:anit: diffic:ult <br>and he exc:laimed.

But if any fortunate person recites this Kalimah <br>with such sincerity of heart that he is altogether spared <br>from punishment in spite of his sins, no one can question <br>the mercv of Almighty Allah, as already stated under aha- <br>dith 9 and 14 of this chapter. <br>Hadith No. 19<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) related that he <br>was told bv Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salam) that Almighty <br>Allah s a p :  \"Onlv 1 am Allah; there is none worthy of <br>worship except I, hence worship only Me; whosoever <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>will come to Me with firm faith in (bYJi~<br>Y) will enter <br>My fort, and whosoever enters My fort will be safe <br>from My punishment.\" <br>Note: <br>If the abovementioned blessing is on the condition that <br>one does not commit major sins, as mentioned under <br>Hadith No 5,then there is no ambiguitv about it: but if reci-<br>tation of the Kalimah, in spite of major sins, is implied. <br>then the word 'punishment' implies eternal punishment. <br>However, Allah's Mercy knows no bounds. It is mentioned <br>in the Qur'an that Alrnighty Allah will not forgive the sin <br>of Shirk (polytheism), but will forgive any other sin, as he <br>may like. According to one hadith. Almighty Allah pun- <br>ishes o111v such persons who revolt agaillst him and refuse <br>to recite , i t  yl JI y, . According to another hadith, the recita- <br>tion of <br>( k Y 1JJ <br>removes the wrath of Almighty Allah. as <br>?<br>l<br>)<br> <br>long as one refrains from attaching more importance to the <br>worldly things as compared with the religion; but if one <br>starts preferring the former over the religion, then recita- <br>tion of (51JIj~y, proves of little use, because then Allah <br>says: \"You are not true to what you profess.\" <br>HadithNo.20 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>form of zikr is (BISI h ~ ) :  <br>and the best form of du'aa is <br>Istighfaar (seeking forgiveness of Allah)\"; then, in sup- <br>port thereof, he recited from Surah Muhammad. the <br>verse <br>So know that 11one is worthy of worship but Allah. <br>It is already given in Hadith No. 1 of this Chapter that <br>( A Y ~<br>JIY, is superior to all other forms of zikr. The rc.asoli for <br><br>I <br>C I i .  11: AIi(~tlilhon Virtues o /K(11i1nclh7'(1!*!ro!~(~h<br>this superiority, according to the Sufis, is that zikr has a <br>special cleansing effect on the heart; by virtue of this zikr, <br>the heart gets purified of all its maladies and, if supple- <br>mented by Istighfaar, this becomes most effective. It is <br>stated in one hadith that when the fish had swallowed <br>Hadhrat Yunus (Alayhis salaam) he recited the prayer <br>and that whosoever supplicates Allah in these words will <br>be granted his prayer. This subject has also been mentioned <br>in Hadith No. 1 of this chapter, namelv that the best form <br>of supplicatiorl is stated to be <br>( 5 &I, . whereas here it is <br>stated to be Istighfaar. This apparent difference is accord-<br>ing to the differing circumstances. For a pious man. (<br>A<br>~<br>J<br>)$ <br>is the best form of supplication, whereas a sinner should <br>% a<br>do Taubah and Istighfaar, and for him Istighfaar is nat- =-i <br>~ r a l l y  the most suitable supplication. For increase of I~en- T <br>efits, praising and glorifying Allah is more effective, while <br>for relieving the evils and hardships, Istighfaar proves to be <br>more effective. There are also several other reasons for this <br>difference. <br>Hadith No. 21 <br>As narrated by Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"Recite ( L I ~ IJ I ~ )and Istighfaar as frequently as vou can, <br>because Shaytaan says: \"I ruin the people by inclining <br>them to commit sins but they frustrate me through <br>their recitation of <br>(&I $ 4 1 ~ )  and Istighfaar. When I find <br>this so, I mislead them to indulge in bid'at and thereby <br>make them follow their base desires in the belief that <br>they are still on the right path.\" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Note:-<br>The main object of Shavtaan is to inject poison into <br>one's mind, as stated under Hadith No. 14 in part 2 of <br>Chapter I, and he is successful in doing so only when the <br>heart is not engaged in zikr. otherwise he has to retreat in <br>disgrace. In fact, zikr of Allah purifies the heart. It is nar- <br>rated in Mishkaat that Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had said: \"For every thing there is a cleaner, and the <br>heart is cleansed by means of zikr of Almighty Allah.\" The <br>effect of Istighfaar is similar, as mentioned in many ahadith <br>that it removes the dust and rust from the heart, Abu Ali <br>Daqqaaq (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that when a person re- <br>cites +~ly,with sinceritv, his heart is cleansed of all dirt (as <br>a mirror is cleaned with a wet cloth), and when he says ,ksi,, <br>his heart shines with its light. It is clear that, under these <br>circumstances, the whole effort of Shaytaan is bound to go <br>waste. <br>Ruining through base desires, means that one may <br>begin to consider wrong as right, and give reiigious sanctity <br>to whatever he desires. This practice has been condemned <br>in the Holv Qur'an at several places. At one place it is said: <br>Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire as a god <br>and Allah sendeth him astray knowingly and sealeth <br>up his hearing and his heart, and setteth on his sight a <br>covering? Then who will lead him, after Allah (hath <br>condemned him)? Will ye not then heed? (Surah <br>XLVl23). <br>It is said at another place in the Holy Qur'an: <br>.. <br>Who geteth further astray than one who followeth his <br>lust without guidance from Allah? Lo! Allah guideth <br>not wrong-doing folk. (XXXVIII/50) <br>There are many other verses on the same subject. It is <br>most trc!ac:herous attack of Shaytaan that he presents an <br>t i .  1 :  t <br>i <br>1 o <br>' i l l ~ l t s( 1  i<br>1 ' <br>I <br>I <br>irreligious deed as a religious one, so that one does it as an <br>article of faith and hopes to get reward for it. As the person <br>performs it as a religious act, there is no likelihood of his <br>doing Taubah. If somebody is habituated to obvious sins, <br>like adultery and theft, there is a possibility that he may do <br>Taubah and give them up, but if somebody is doing a <br>wrong thing under the impression that it is religious duty, <br>the question of his doing Taubah does not arise. Rather, he <br>will get more involved in it day by day. This explains the <br>words of the Shaytaan: \"I involved them in sins, but they <br>frustrated my efforts through zikr, Taubah, and Istighfaar: <br>thereu~on 1 entrapped them in such a manner that their <br>escape became impossible.\" <br>'I'hus, it is essential that in all matters of religion, guid- <br>ance be sought frorn the ways of life of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and of his Companions (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum). Doing otherwise is devoid of virtue, and will <br>entail sins. <br>lrnam Ghazali (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported from <br>Hasan Basri. (Rahmatullah alaih) a narrative that Shaytaan <br>says: \"I presented sinful deeds in an attactive form to the <br>Muslims, but they nullified my efforts through Istighfaar. <br>Then I presented before them vices in the garb of virtues, <br>thus leaving no initiative for Istighfaar.\" Instances of such <br>vices are self-made innovations in religious practices. <br>Wahb bin Munabbih (Rah~natullah alaih) says: \"Fear <br>Almighty Allah. who knows everything; you curse Shay- <br>taan in the presence of others, but you quietly obey and be- <br>friend him.\" Some Sufis have narrated: \"It is most <br>unfortunate that, in spite of knowing Almighty Allah as our <br>real benefactor, and ackrlowledgillg His favours, we should <br>show disobedience to Him and obey Shaytaan, whom we <br>know and believe to be most tre~~c.horous <br>and our greatest <br>enemv.\" <br>Hadith No 22 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>is.&C@~jd@JjlydjJ JUI& i<br>~<br>U<br>~<br>~<br>i<br>~<br>k<br>~<br>diplrj. : <br>L J & J , , ~ , , ~ ; L I & W ; ~ ~ Y ~ J ~ Y<br>~ l i ~ q c . J i ~ , 1 ; ? 1 4 b ~ ; r i e ,  <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"Whosoever professes sincere belief in i~<br>j+; G81y~j~y <br>at the time of his death, shall certainly enter Paradise.\" <br>According to another hadith, \"He shall certainly be <br>pardoned by Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re-<br>ported to have said: \"Listen to happy tidings, and convey <br>them to others as well. that whosoever believes in ,L JJI y, <br>with sincerity of heart, shall enter Paradise.\" It is the Ikh- <br>laas that is valued by Almighty Allah. A small deed done <br>with Ikhlaas (sincerity) earns a great reward: but anything <br>done for the sake of mere show or to please some people, <br>will 'earn no good reward, but punishment from Almighty <br>Allah. That is why a person who recites the Kalimah with <br>sincerity of heart will certainly be pardoned and admitted <br>into Paradise. It may or may not be that he undergoes some <br>punishment for his sins before going to Paradise; but, if <br>Almighty Allah is really pleased with particular deeds of a <br>sinning believer, He may forgive all his sins in the very <br>first instance. When Allah is so Merciful and Gracious, it is <br>our greatest misfortune if we do not serve and obey Him in <br>full. In short, great rewards are promised in these ahadith <br>for one who believes in the Kalimah Tayyibah. Two possi- <br>bilities are however there: he may have to suffer some pun- <br>ishment for his sins according to the general rule before <br>being forgiven, or he may be forgiven forthwith without <br>any punishment by Almighty Allah, out of sheer Mercy <br>and Grace. <br>Yahva bin Akhtam (~ahmatullah alaih) is a Muhad-<br>dith. After his death, somebody saw him ill a dream, and <br>asked him how he had fared. He replied: \"I appeared <br>before Almighty Allah, and He said to me: 'You sinful old <br>man, you did this and you did that', till all my sins were <br>recounted one by one, and I was asked if I had any expla- <br>nation in my defence. I submitted that no hadith to that <br>effect had been conveyed to me. Then Allah asked: 'What <br>hadith had been conveyed to you?' I submitted: \"I was told <br>by Abdur Kazzaaq who was told by Muammar who waz <br>told t)y Zuhri who was tolti bv Ilrkvnh who was told bv <br><br>(;/I. 11: /ihudi1h on Virtues of Kctlimcth 'I'(ty!i(ll)(th 135 <br>Hadhrat .Aa-ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha), who was told by <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was told bv <br>Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam), who was told by You: 'A <br>person who grows to old age in Islam may have deserved <br>punishment on account of his sins, yet as a token of respect <br>for his old age, I pardon him', and You know that I am very <br>old.\" Allah then said, Abdur Razzaaq spoke the truth, <br>Muammar spoke the truth, Zuhri spoke the truth, Urwah <br>spoke the truth, 'Aa-ishah (Radhivallaho anha) spoke the <br>truth, Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spoke the <br>truth, Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) spoke the truth, and what <br>I had said is true.' After that, it was ordered that I should <br>be admitted into Paradise.\" <br>Hadith No 23 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho al'aihe wasallam) said: <br>\"There are obstacles in the way of every action before <br>it reaches Almighty Allah, but recitation of $1$&5!) <br>and the prayer of a father in favour of his son go up to <br>Him unchecked.\" <br>Note: <br>'Going unchecked upto Almighty Allah means that <br>these two actions are accepted without any delay. Whereas <br>there are intermediate stages for other deeds before they <br>reach Allah, these two things go to Him directly. <br>There is a story of a Kaafir king, who was extremely <br>cruel and bigoted against the Muslims. It so happened that <br>he was captured alive in a battle against the Muslims. As <br>he had caused a lot of sufferings to the Muslims, they were <br>naturally very revengeful. They put him in a cauldron <br>placed on fire. At first, he besought his idol gods for help, <br>but finding no response from them he* b7came a Muslim <br>and started continuous recitation of <br>Y!& 9). How sin- <br>cerelv and devotedly he must have been reciting can well <br>Virtue: of Zikr <br>be imagined. At once help came from Almighty Allah in <br>the form of heavy rain, which extinguished the fire and <br>I<br>cooled the cauldron. It was then followed bv a powerful <br>I<br>cyclone which carried away the cauldron and dropped it in <br>a city inhabited by non-believers. He was still engaged in <br>the recitation of the Kalimah. The people there were <br>wonderstruck by this scene, and after listening to his whole <br>story all them also embraced Islam. <br>Hadith No. 24 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: \"On the <br>Day of Resurrectinn, He!] <br>yould be forbidden for all <br>those who had recited c~lY!o!.j, with the sole aim of <br>earning the pleasure of Allah.\" <br>Note: <br>That a person who recites Kalimah Tayyibah with sin- <br>cerity will, as a rule, be safe from the fire of Hell is con- <br>ditional on his being free from the major sins. Forbidding <br>of Hell for such a person may of course mean that his eter- <br>nal stav therein is forbidden: but who is there to question <br>Almighty Allah if he forbids Hell altogether for the sincere <br>reciter of the Kalimah, in spite of his sins. Mention is made <br>in ahadith of such people whose sins will be enumerated <br>by Almighty Allah on the Day of Judgement. so that they <br>will feel sure of being doomed to heavy punishment, but <br>after their confession, Allah will say to them: '1 covered <br>your sins in your worldly life, and I cover them now and <br>pardon you.' Many similar cases have been related in aha- <br>dith. There is thus little wonder if all the reciters of the Ka- <br>limah may be treated in this way. There are many blessings <br>and benefits in reciting the exalted name'of Allah, so that <br>one should do it as often as possible. How luckv are those <br>blessed souls who understood the virtues of this Kalimah. <br>and devoted their lives fullv to its recitation. <br><br>Hadith No 25<br>I <br>..<br>,<br> <br>JG <br>3 j$G.p a&jjJG <br>& 2 (yo)<br>0 ' ~  <br>h\\<br>sj <br>4A.j <br>+ i  <br>,<br>J& <br>;!<br>. <br> J & ~+Jl <br>> <br>#. <br>J,j ;? r;i JG w..j'!3 ;;rj ;;iJ$ <br>$/& i;ul <br>, .  h <br>* <br>2 *hl; <br>JG <br>y! <br>I <br>G3i&.. >.+i <br>& <br>+q<br>&I <br>L .

Somebody asked him why <br>he was so sad. Ile said: \"I had heard from Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he knew the words <br>which, if recited by a dying person at the time of his <br>death, brings him relief from the pangs of death, so <br>that his face brightens and he dies in happiness. Unfor- <br>tunately I c;ould not enquire about those words from <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and therefore <br>I arn feeling unhappy.\" Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said that he knew7 those words. Ijadhrat Talhah <br>(Kadhiyallaho anha) jovously asked what those were <br>and Hadhrat Unlar (Radlliyallaho anho) said: \"We<br>know that no words are better than the Kalimah which <br>was offered by Rasulullall (Sallallah~~ <br>qle~he wasallam) <br>to his uncle Abu Taalib and it is (d\\Yl 4).\" Hadhrat<br>Talhah (Kadhiyallaho anho) said \"Hv Allah! it is this, <br>By Allah! it is this.\" <br>Note:<br>It is related and implied in manv ahadit11 that the Kali- <br>mah Tavyibah constitutes light and happiness through and <br>through. Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahnlatulla!~ alaih) has stated in <br>his book Mun'ibbihaat: \"'There are ~ I ! , I J  kirlds of darknesses, <br>for which there are five specific lights. The love of the <br>world is a darkness, the light for it is a piety; sin is a dark- <br>ness, the light for which is Taubah; the grave is a darkness, <br>I <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>the light for which is the Kalimah c h l & U  <br>311 i!d! Y) the <br>i <br>next life is a darkness, the light for which is good deeds; <br>and Pulsiraat is a darkness, the light for which is Faith.\" <br>Raabiah Adawiyyah (Rahmatullah alaiha) a well <br>known woman saint, used to remain busy in salaat <br>throughout the night, would sleep a little at the time of <br>early dawn and would wake up abruptly just before the <br>Fajr prayer, blaming herself and saying: \"How long will <br>you lie asleep; sbon you will be in the grave, where you <br>will sleep till the Doomsday.\" At the time of her death, she <br>told her maid-servant that she should be buried in the <br>patched woolen cloak, which she used to wear at the time <br>of Tahajjud prayer, and that nobody should be informed or <br>her death. After her burial according to her wishes, the <br>maid-servant saw her in a dream wearing a very beautiful <br>dress. When asked what happened to her old woolen dress, <br>she replied that it had been deposited with her deeds. The <br>maid servant requested her for some advice, and she re- <br>plied: \"Do zikr of Almighty Allah as much as you can; by <br>virtue of this you will be worthy of envy in the grave.\" <br>At the time of the death of the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), his companions were so <br>much shocked and grieved that many of them became <br>overwhelmed with frustration and doubts of various <br>sorts. Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"I <br>was also one of those who were given to frustration. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) came to me and <br>wished me salaam, but I was too absorbed to be aware <br>of his coming. He complained to Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) that I was displeased with him, so <br>much so that I did not respond even to his salaam. <br>Then both of them came to me and wished me salaam. <br>and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) enquired <br>8 3  <br>of me the reason why I had not responded to Umar's <br>Ei5 <br>salaam. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Yes, I <br>swear by Allah, most certainly you did\". Idenied having be-<br>haved like this, and told them I did not even know of his <br>comin and wishing me salaam. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad-<br>hiyallAo anho) accepted my explanation, and said that it <br>must have happened so, and that probably I must have been <br>absorbed in some thought. I confessed that Iwas indeed ab- <br>sorbed in deep thought. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) enquired what it was, and I submitted that I <br>was worried because Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) had died and we had failed to enquire from <br>him the basic thing required for salvation. Hadhrat <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) said that he had made <br>this enquiry from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). I got up, and praised him saying that only he was <br>worthy of this honour, because he always exelled in <br>matters of religion. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) then said, I had asked Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) what basic thing was necessary for <br>salvation, and he had replied that whoever accepts the <br>Kalimah that he had offered to his uncle Abu Talib at <br>the time of his death (but which he rejected) will have <br>salvation, and that this Kalimah leads to salvation.\" <br>Note: <br>All the Sahabah were so much upset and overwhelmed <br>with grief and sorrow that even Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), in spite of his being so brave, held out his <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>sword in his hand and proclaimed: \"I will chop off the <br>head of whosoever.says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is dead. He has only gone to meet his Allah, as <br>Hadhrat Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone on Mount <br>Toor.\" Some of the Sahabas feared that the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) meant the end of <br>Islam, some thought that there was no longer any chance <br>for the progress of Islam, whereas some were dumb-<br>founded and could not even speak. It was only Hadhrat <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) who, in spite of his extreme <br>love and attachment with Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), remained firm, calm, and collected. He got up and <br>delivered his forceful address, beginning with the verse <br>j i <br>j <br>, which means \"Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is but a messenger; many messengers <br>have passed away before him. Will it be that when he dieth <br>or is slain, ye will turn back on your heels? He who turneth <br>back doth no harm to Allah, but Allah will reward the duti- <br>ful.\" This story has been briefly related by me in my book <br>Stories of Sahabah. <br>Another point made in the above mentioned hadith is <br>on what essential basic thing does salvation depend. It can <br>be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, it may mean: The mat- <br>ters of Deen are many, but what is that on which all these <br>things of 'Deen depehd, and which is indispensable? <br>According to this interpretation, the reply given above is <br>clearly understood: The whole of Deen depends on the Ka- <br>lfmah which is the fundamental tenet of Islam. Secondly it <br>can mean that there are hardships in the path of Deen viz. <br>doubts crop up, the machinations of the devil are a con- <br>stant source of trouble, worldly needs demand one's atten- <br>tion, etc.; how can these be overcome? In this case, the <br>saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would <br>mean1 that frequent recitation of Kalimah Tayyibah will <br>help overcome all these difficulties, for it develops sincer- <br>ity of intention, it cleanses the heart, it causes defeat of the <br>devil, and has many other benefits, as mentioned' in all <br>these ahadith. It is said in one hadIth that the Kalimah <br>&I yl d! 9, <br>wards off ninety nine kinds of calami- <br>ties, the least of which is grief, which is a constant worry <br>for a man. <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahudith on Virtues of Kalirnah Tuyyubah <br>Hadith No.27 <br>-<br>+Y j\\<br>\\sjy w $1 d,+3 w $1 dJ3 b  irb Ti1 epb &I + a,i5 <br>1-b JIiJ >I f! i!J ,UI &G $1 4./r YI US <br>JI <br>4 3 L+ Uj.21 icl( <br>'-+& 3 i+L: J(3 Wi &G, <br>,<br>8 2<br>gr;j<br>Hadhrat , Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that he had heard Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"I know of a Kalimah which, if-recited by <br>a person with sincerity of heart, fobids the fire of Hell <br>to touch him.\", Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: \"Shall I tell you what that Kalimah is? It is the <br>same Kalimah by virtue of which Almighty Allah hon- <br>oured Rasulullah (Sallallaho -alaihd wasallam) and his <br>companions, it is the same Kalimah of piety that was <br>offered by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to <br>his uncle Abu Taalib at the time of his death. It is L $1 ~ I J .  <br>Note: <br>This well known story of Abu Taalib, the uncle of Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is given in the books <br>of Hadith, Tafseer, and history. As he had been helping Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and the Muslims, Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) went to him when he <br>wasabout to die,and said: \"Omy uncle,recite (2 4! ii!J, , even <br>now, so that I may be able to intercede on your behalf on <br>the Day of Judgement, and i may bear witness before Allah <br>that you embraced Islam.\" Abu Taalib replied: \"People will <br>taunt me for having accepted the faith of my nephew for <br>fear of death, otherwise I would have pleased you by recit- <br>ing this Kalimah.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>returned from there deeply grieved. It was in this connec- <br>tion that the Qur'anic verse <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>was revealed, which means: \"Lo! Thou guidest not whom <br>thou lovest, but Allah guideth whom He will.\" It is evident <br>from this incident that those who indulge in sins and bad <br>deeds, and disobey Allah and His Prophet Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaibe wasallam), but think that they will get salva- <br>tion by virtue of the prayer in their favour of some pious <br>person are sadly mistaken. All power rests with Almighty <br>Allah, to whom we should always turn and with whom we <br>should establish our real connection. However, the com- <br>pany of pious men and their prayers and good wishes can <br>help us in achieving this end. <br>Hadith No.28 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"After Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam) happened to <br>commit the mistake as a result of which he was trans- <br>ferred from Paradise to this Earth, he used to spend all <br>his time in weeping, praying and repenting, and once <br>he looked up towards the Heaven and prayed: \"0 <br>Allah! I beg Thy forgiveness in the name of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" \"Who is Muhammad?\" <br>came the enquiry through Divine revelation. He <br>replied: \"When you had created me. I saw the words <br>L JjL; U d  BI i!d! J written on Your Arsh, and since then <br>I believed that no human being is superior to Muham- <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kulimah I'ayjabuh <br>mad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), whose name ap-<br>peared along with Yours.\" In reply, it was revealed, <br>\"He is to be the last of all the prophets, and will be <br>your descendant. If he were not to be created, you <br>would not have been created.\" <br>Note: <br>How, at that time, Aadam (Alayhis salaam) prayed, <br>wept and besought pardon has been described in many <br>ahadith. Only those who have experienced the agony of the <br>displeasure of a master can have some idea about the plight <br>of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam). On account of the dis- <br>pleasure of earthly masters, a servant gets very much wor- <br>ried, but in the case of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam) it <br>was the displeasure of the Lord of Lords, the Sustainer of <br>the whole universe, and in short the anger of Allah the <br>Great himself over one before whom the Angels were made <br>to bow, and who enjoyed the position of a favourite. The <br>'E; <br>8 3<br>Cs <br>higher the position of a favourite, the more he feels the <br>wrath of the Master, provided he is not mean; and in this <br>case a prophet was involved. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) narrated that Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam) <br>wept so much that his weeping exceeded the total weeping <br>by all the people of this world, and he remained in sajdah <br>for forty years without lifting up his head even once. Hadh- <br>rat Buraidah (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrated that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: \"The weeping <br>of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam), if compared, will <br>exceed the weeping by all the people of the world.\" It is <br>stated in another hadith that his tears would outweigh the <br>tears shed by all his descendants. Under these circum- <br>stances, in how many ways he must have lamented and re- <br>I <br>I <br>pented can well be imagined. In addition, he even begged <br>to be pardoned for the sake of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).<br>That the Kalimah &I jj;;Gbi!A! 9 is written on the <br>Arsh is corroborated by many other ahadith. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: \"When I entered <br>Paradise, I saw three lines written in gold on both sides. In <br>the first line was written <br>hl JjL; Gi& 3, g! A! 9 <br>In the second was written <br>u> <br>&Lj <br>&j & G j  U&j sJj <br>Virtues of ;:ikr <br>What we sent in advance (i.e. charity, etc.), we found, what <br>we consumed we enjoyed', and what we left behind we <br>lost), <br>and in the third line was written <br>(People are sinful, but the Lord is forgiving). <br>A saint relates: \"I happened to visit a town in India, <br>and there I came across a tree, the fruit of which resembles <br>the almond and has a double shell. When it ip broken, a <br>rolled green leaf comes out with <br>JjL; 3% <br>Q in-<br>scribed on it in red. When I spoke about it to Abu Yaqoob, <br>the hunter, he was not suprised at all, and told me that in <br>Elah he had caught a fish, which had <br>gl q inscribed on <br>. .<br>one ear and <br>j;; <br>t;;; on the other. <br>Hadith No. 29 <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The greatest <br>name of Allah, which is generally known as Ismul- <br>A'zam, is contained in the following two verses (pro- <br>vided these are recited with Ikhlaas).\" <br>Note: <br>It is stated in several ahadith that whatever prayer is <br>made after the recitation of Ismul-A'zam is granted by <br>Allah. However, scholars differ in specifying the Ismul- <br>A'zam, as is the case with some of the most sublime things <br>that Almighty Allah keeps them partly secret. This results <br>in difference of opinion about their specification. Thus, <br>1 <br>I <br>I <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalirnah 7'aypabah <br>there is difference of opinion about Laylatul Qadr (Night of <br>Power) and in respect of the special time of acceptance of <br>prayer on Friday. This difference of opinion in such mat- <br>ters is a blessing in disguise, as explained in detail in my <br>book on Fadhaail-e-Ramadhaan. Thus, there have been dif- <br>ferent narrations in respect of Ismul-A'zam; that given <br>above is one of these. There have been ahadith too in <br>regard to these two ayaat as follows:- <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reported that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] had said that no other <br>verse falls so heavy on the most mischievous and wicked <br>devils as the two ayats beginning with <br>According to Ibrahim bin Wasma, the recitation of the fol- la<br>lowing ayats is very effective in cases of mental derange- <br>ment, etc., and whosoever is particular in their recitation <br>will be safeguarded against such maladies; and that these <br>are written on the corner of the Arsh and cause relief to ter- <br>rified children or those who fear of the evil eye. <br>Allama Shami (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted Imam <br>Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah alaih) as saying that Ismul-A'zam <br>is the word \"Allah\". He has also stated that Allama Ta- <br>haawi as well as other scholars supported this view. The <br>great mystics and Sufis also have reached the same conclu- <br>sion, and that is why the zikr of this Holy word is practised <br>more than anything else by their followers. The leader of <br>the saints. Hadhrat Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (may Allah <br>enlighten his grave), is also of the same view that \"Allah\" <br>is the Ismul-A'zam, provided at the time of its recitation, <br>there is nothing but Allah in one's mind. He further ad- <br>vised that during its recitation ordinary people should <br>think of His grandeur and fear Him, while the spe ialists in <br>zikr should also concentrate on His attributes, an $i the sel- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ected few should have in their mind thoughts of nothing <br>else except Almighty Allah. He also stated that it was for <br>this reason that this blessed name is mentioned so many <br>times, in fact two thousand three hundred and sixty times, <br>in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Shaikh Ismail Farghaani (Rahmatullah alaih) relates: \"1 <br>had, for a long time, a keen desire to learn this Ismul- <br>A'zam, and for this purpose I had undergone great hard- <br>ships: I would fast for days together, so much that some- <br>times I would fdll senseless on account of severe hunger. <br>One day, I was sitting in a mosque in Damascus, when two <br>men entered there and stood besides me. To me they <br>looked like angels. One of them said to the other: \"Do you <br>want to learn Ismul-A'zam?\" \"Yes\", replied the other, <br>\"please tell me.\" On hearing this conversation, I became <br>more attentive. The former said, \"It is the word \"Allah\", <br>provided it is recited with Sidqul-Lija (I+ J-1, <br>which <br>according to Shaikh Ismail (Rahmatullah alaih) is the state <br>of mind comparable to that of a drowning person when <br>there is nobody to save him, and he calls Almighty Allah <br>I <br>for help with extreme sincerity. In order to learn the Ismul- <br>A'zam one should possess high qualities as well as endur- <br>ance and self-restraint. There is a story of a pious person <br>who knew the Ismul-A'zam. Once a man came to him and <br>begged that 'he should be taught the Ismul-A'zam: \"You <br>lack the required capability,\" said the pious person. \"No, I <br>am capable of learning it,\" said the supplicant. The pious <br>person then asked him to go and sit at a particular place <br>and then come back and relate to him his observations. The <br>man went there and saw an old man who was bringing fire- <br>wood on his donkey from the jungle. A policeman came <br>from the other direction and started beating the old man <br>and snatched away his firewood. The man was extremely <br>enraged against the policeman and came back to report the <br>whole incident before the pious person, and said that if he <br>had known the Ismul-A'zam he would have prayed against <br>that policeman. The pious man said: \"I learnt the Ismul- <br>A'zam from that very old man who was bringing the fire- <br>wood.\" <br>Hadith No.30 <br>I <br><br> <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 147 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said that <br>Almighty Allah will order on the Day of Judgement: <br>\"Take out of Hell all persons who professed (by!ii!y, <br>and who had an iota of Imaan in their hearts; take all <br>those who recited (L <br>4) or remembered Me in any <br>way or feared Me on any occasion.\" <br>Note: <br>The blessings-that Almighty Allah bestows on account <br>of this Kalimah can be imagined from the fact that if a hun- <br>dred years old man, who practised Kufr and Shirk all his <br>life, happens to recite this Kalimah once with Imaan and <br>VI2 %<br>L <br>sincerity, he becomes a Muslim and all the sins committed <br>EN <br>by him are washed away; and if he happens to commit any <br>sins after he had become a Muslim, even then, by virtue of <br>this Kalimah, he will sooner or later be released from Hell. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifa (Radhiyallaho anho) who was a confi- <br>dant of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had once said: <br>\"A time will come when Islam will become weak arid dim <br>like the worn-out prints on an old cloth, when nobody will <br>even know about fasting, Hajj or Zakaat, till one night even <br>the Qur'an will be lifted from this world, so that no one <br>will remember any ayat. At this time, old men and women <br>will say that they had heard their elders reciting the Kali- <br>mah ( j ~<br>jlilq, and that they would recite it too.\" A pupil of <br>Hadhrat Huzaifa enquired: \"When there is no Hajj, Zakaat, <br>fasting or any other fundamental of Islam, will the mere <br>Kalimah then be of any use?' Hadhrat Huzaifa (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not answer, but when his pupil repeated his <br>enquiry a second and then a third time, he replied: \"Sooner <br>or later it will cause deliverance from Hell, deliverance <br>from Hell, deliverance from Hell.\" He implied that the Ka- <br>limah will deliver from Hell after one has undergone the <br>punishment for not observing the fundamentals of Islam. <br>This is what is meant by above mentioned hadith that a <br>person with even an iota of Imaan will be freed from Hell <br>one day. It is als? qarrated in one hadith: \"Vl'hosoever re-<br>cites the Kalimah &I '91 d!J. it will ccjme to his rescue one day, <br>which may be after he has undergone some punishment.\" <br>lirtues of Zikr <br>Hadith No. 31 <br>+ & & ~ ; j g $  <br>I<br>h <br>L <br>I-,<br>4i! w 13 i*' cjE 431 Lj <br>a(,., <br>$1 Y! il!Y<br>* dL;I' 4 P! jLl2' yj d<br>l 4 <br>c;C GI),! jyl #I),Jb i$1 Jl& <br>J ~ J \" ~ ; C ~ ~ ' ~ ~ J !

When a person's <br>outward behaviour is incorrect, his inner mind is bound to <br>be defective as well. Hence every effort is to be made to im- <br>prove the exterior because the interior is dependant on it. <br>2 2<br>and the Sufis lay stress on outward cleanliness through <br>Wudhu. etc., as a first step for attaining inner purity. Those 8 <br>who talk of internal improvement and ignore the external <br>betterment are not right. The external betterment is as im- <br>portant as the internal one. One of the duaas of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was: <br>0 Allah! make my interior better than my exterior, and <br>i J ~ Fmake my exterior noble and good).

Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>him: \"You look very sad. What is the matter with <br>you?\" He replied: \"My cousin died last night, and I <br>was sitting near him when he breathed his last.\" \"Did <br>you persuade him to recite ;I i!ii!J?\" asked Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Yes\", said he. \"Did he <br>recite?\" asked Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Yes, he had recited it,\" said he. \"Then certainly he <br>will go to Paradise,\" said the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). \"What do the living people get if they recite <br>this Kalimah?\" enquired Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said <br>twice: \"This Kalimah will demolish and ever1 elimi- <br>nate their sins.\" <br>Note: <br>Stress is laid in many ahadith on reciting Kalimah near <br>the dead and in the graveyard. It is said in one hadith that <br>the Kalimah +Ii!i!.j, <br>should be recited profusely during a <br>funeral. In another hadith it is said that dii!d!u' (none is <br>worthy of worship except Thee) will be the distinguishing <br>mark of this Ummat, when they pass over the Siraat (the <br>Bridge). In vet another hadith. it is related that when they <br>will rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection. they <br>will be reciting. <br>$& >,;I i!ii! y <br>(Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah, and on Him <br>the faithful will rely).

Abul Abbaas related: \"I was lying sick <br>in the town of Ashbila. I saw a large flock of huge birds of <br>different colours, white, red, green, etc., which were <br>spreading their wings all together and there were many <br>men who were carrying something in big covered trays. I <br>took them as gifts of death, and started reciting the Kalimah <br>Tayyibah hurriedly. Then one of those men said to me that <br>the time of my death had not yet come, and that this was a <br>gift for another believer.\" <br>Just before his death, Hadhrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) asked those around him to make him <br>sit up. After they did so, he said: \"0Allah! You ordered <br>me to do many things, which I could not do, and You for- <br>bade me certain things, but I disobeyed you in them.\" He <br>repeated these words thrice. and then after reciting <br>,iaJ!iij)began to stare in one direction. Somebody asked <br>him what was he looking at He said: \"There are green fig- <br>ures who are neither men nor Jinn\", and then breathed his <br>last. <br>Sombeody saw Zubaidah (Rahmatullah alaiha) in <br>dream and asked her how she fared.

A!Y, <br>also a virtue?\" \"It is the best of all virtues,\" was the <br>reply of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Note: <br>A minor sin, no doubt, is washed away by a virtuoys <br>deed, but a major one is wiped off, as a rule, through <br>Taubah or of course through the Mercy of Almighty Allah, <br>as explained earlier in this book. In either case, the wiped- <br>out sin is neither written in the account of deeds nor men- <br>tioned anywhere else. So it is said in one hadith that when <br>a man does Taubah, the Almighty Allah makes the scribing <br>angels forget that sin. It is forgotten even by the hands and <br>feet of the sinner, and even by the piece of land where it <br>was committed, so that there is nobody to give evidence for <br>that sin on the Day of Judgement, when the hands, feet, and <br>other parts of the body of the person himself will stand wit- <br>ness for his gopd or bad deeds, as will be explained in <br>Hadith No. 18 of Chapter 2 part 3. <br>The subject matter of the above mentioned hadith is <br>supported by many other ahadith. There are many ahadith <br>to the effect that Taubah from a sin washes it away, as if <br>one had never committed it. Taubah means to repent and <br>feel ashamed of the sin that has been committed, and make <br>a firm resolution not to repeat it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe .Wasallam) according to <br>one hadith has said: \"Do wo~ship Allah only, and do not <br>ascribe any partner to Him; be since~e in all your actions es <br>if you are standing before Almighty Allah; consider your- <br>self among the dead; remember Allah near every stone and <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>every tree, so that there are many witnesses in your favour <br>on the Day of Judgement: and if you happen to commit a <br>sin, do some virtue immediately in atonement thereof, so <br>that if the sin is committed in secret the virtue should also <br>be done in secret, and if the sin is committed openly the <br>virtue should also be done openly.\" <br>Hadith No 34 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"Whosoever recites the following ten times will be re- <br>warded with forty thousand virtues\": <br>Note: <br>Great rewards are mentioned in the books of hadith for <br>reciting Kalimah Tayyibah a certain number of times. It is <br>said in one hadith: \"When you offer an obligatory Salaat, <br>then recite: <br>ten times, because its reward is equivalent to that of releas- <br>ing a slave from bondage.\" <br>Hadith No 35 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>It is said in another hadith: \"Whoever recites: <br>two million virtues will be written to his credit. <br>Note: <br>How great is the kindness and benevolence of <br>Almighty Allah, that He bestows thousands and millions of <br>virtues for the mere recitation of this Kalimah, which <br>action does not involve hard labour or much time; but, un- <br>fortunately we are negligent and remain so much absorbed <br>in our wordly pursuits that we never care to take advantage <br>of these bounties. Almighty Allah grants at least ten times <br>reward for every virtue, provided it is done with Ikhlaas, <br>and then this reward multiplies further according to the <br>degree of sincerity. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said: \"When a person embraced Islam, all his previous <br>sins are forgiven, and then every virtue is rewarded ten to <br>seven hundred times, and even more than that as Almighty <br>Allah may please, but a sin is indicated as a single deed <br>and if it is forgiven by Allah it is not even mentioned in the <br>account of deeds.\" According to another hadith, a virtue is <br>noted in the account of a person as soon as he intends to do <br>it, but when it is actually done its reward is increased from <br>ten to seven hundred times, and even more, as Allah may <br>please. There are many ahadith to this effect, that Allah's <br>bounty knows no limits, provided a person tries to deserve <br>it. The pious people keep this thing in view, and so they <br>are not misled by any amount of worldly wealth. <br>(0Allah! make me one of them). <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"There are six kinds of deeds and four categories of people. <br>Of the deeds, the first two kinds lead to definite results, <br>two carry equivalent rewards while the reward is ten times <br>for the fifth and seven hundred times for the remaining <br>one. Of the first two kinds of deed, one is certain to lead to <br>Paradise a person who is free from Shirk at the time of his <br>death, and the other is certain to lead to Hell a person who <br>L<br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on,Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>is committed to Shirk at the time of his death; of the two <br>kinds of deeds which bring equivlrlent rewards, one is to <br>make firm intention for a virtuous deed (before its actual <br>performance), and the other is to commit a sin which is <br>also recorded as one only. The fifth is to do a noble deed, <br>the reward for which is ten times, while the sixth is to <br>spend wealth in the path of Allah, in which case the <br>reward is enhanced seven hundred times. <br>Of the four categories of people, the first is of those <br>who enjoy prosperity in this world but will face adversity <br>in the Hereafter, the second is of those who face adversity <br>in this world but will enjoy prosperity in the Hereafter; the <br>people in the third category face adversity in both the <br>worlds i.e. they are poor in this life and will be punished <br>'S<br>in the Hereafter, and the fourth category includes those <br>who are well off in both the worlds. <br>r* <br>A person came to Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and asked him if he had narrated that Almighty <br>Allah multiplies the reward of some virtues one million <br>times. He swore in confirmation that he had heard it <br>exactly like that. According to another version, he had <br>heard it from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that <br>the reward of some virtues is two million times. Almighty <br>Allah says in the Holy Qur'an &J+ <br>2d > rjijWfr;) that <br>He multiplies the virtues and grants from His treasure great <br>rewards. Who can imagine the extent of the reward which <br>has been described as great by Almighty Lord? <br>According to imam Ghazali, (Rahmatullah alaih] the <br>great reward will be possible only if we recite these words <br>with full concentration on their meanings, because import- <br>ant attributes of Almighty Allah are described therein. <br>L <br>Hadith No 36 <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When a <br>person performs wudhu (ablution) properly (i.e. ob- <br>serving all its essentials as well as details) and then re- <br>cites: <br>(I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship <br>except Allah, the One who has no partner, and also <br>that Muhammad is His slave and prophet), all the eight <br>gates of Paradise are thrown open for him, so that he <br>may enter as he likes, through anyone of them. <br>One gate is enough for entering into Paradise, but <br>opening of all the eight gates is a mark of special welcome <br>and extreme favour. According to another hadith, a person <br>who did not indulge in Shirk before his death, and never <br>committed any unlawful murder, is allowed to enter para- <br>dise as he may like through any one of its gates. <br>Hadith No. 37 <br>A erson who recite6 (bu'lope hundred times a day, <br>wii'1 on the Day of Resurrection, be raised with his face <br>shining like the full moon, and none can surpass him <br>in excellence on that day except one who recites this <br>Kalimah more than he. <br>Many ahaadith and ayaat confirm that ( i t 4 1  <br>is a light <br>for the heart as well as for the face. It has been observed <br>41 j <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 157 <br>that the pious people who are used to reciting this Kalimah <br>excessively have a sort of brightness over their faces, even <br>during their earthly life. <br>Hadith No. 38 <br>Rasulullah (Sal\\allaho alaihe wasallam) says. \"Teach <br>the Kalimah (LIY!~!Y) to a child when h~ s!arts speaking <br>and persuade a dying person tp r,ecite (btY! a!%. He who <br>has hads his beginning with (aY!a!Y) and has his end <br>with <br>YIil!~),<br>he would not be required to account for <br>any of his sins, even though he lives for thousand <br>years, (i.e. either he would commit no sin, or if he hap- <br>pened to commit any sin, it would be written off by <br>virtue of Taubah or through the sheer mercy of <br>Almighty Allah). <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Note: <br>The best way to persuade a dying man to recite the Ka- <br>limah is that those sitting near him should recite it, so that <br>on hearing it he may also do the same. He should not be <br>compelled to do it, because he is dying in agony. That a <br>dying person should be persuaded to recite the Kalimah <br>has been stressed in many ahaadith. In several ahaadith, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said, \"The sins of a person who is blessed to recite the Ka- <br>limah at the time of death are washed off just as a building <br>is washed away by flood water.\" According to other ahaa- <br>dith, one who recites this blessed Kalimah before his death <br>gets all his past sins forgiven. It is said in one hadith that a <br>hypocrite is never able to recite it (at the time of hjs death). <br>It is said in another hadith that we should give ~ & I Y ! ~ I Y ,as <br>provision to our deceased ones. According to a hadith. <br>one who brings up a child till he is able to recite <br>will not be required to render any account. In one hadith it <br>is said, \"When a person who has been steadfast in offer- <br>ing salaat is about to die, an Angel comes to him, drives <br>away the Satan and persuades him to recite the Kalimah <br>(A1 j>; G d  i li!ii!3). <br>It is however often observed that this sort of yersua- <br>sion proves useful only in case of those who are accus- <br>tomed to the recitation of the Kalimah during their lifetime. <br>A story is related about a person who used to trade in <br>straw: When he was about to die, people tried to persuade <br>him to recite the Kalimah, but he only cried out. \"The price <br>of this bundle is so much and of that is so much.\" Many <br>such incidents. which had been actually observed, have <br>been described in the book. \"Nuzhatul Basaateen\". <br>Sometimes, involvement^ in a sin prevents a dving <br>person from reciting the Kalimah. The Ulama say that <br>opium has seventy disadvantages, one of which is that the <br>opium-user cannot recollect the Kalimah at the time of his <br>death. On the contrary. brushing one's teeth (with mis- <br>waak) carries seventy benefits. one of which is that to recite <br>Kalimah at the time of his death. It is related about one <br>man that, when he was persuaded before his death to recite <br>the Kalimah. he expressed his inabilitv to recite, because <br>he said, he used to cheat through underweighing. There is <br>a story of another persorl who, when persuaded to recite <br>the Kalimah, said. \"I cannot say it, because I was tempted <br>to cast sinful looks on a woman who had come to purchase <br>I <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 159 <br>a towel from my shop.\" Many such stories are related in <br>the book. 'Tazkirah Qurtabvah'. In view of the foregoing. it <br>is essential for a man to ask and seek Allah's help, forgive- <br>ness of his sins, and to recite the Kalimah at the time of <br>one's death. <br>Hadith No.39 <br>h <br>O <br>' . # ,  <br>I<br>-<br>JI Y! d!

It is the pre-requisite for the ac- <br>ceptance of Salaat. Fasting, Hajj and Zakaat. because unless <br>there is Imaan, no action is acceptable. Recitation of Kali- <br>mah Tayyibah, which amounts to profession of faith, is not <br>dependent on anything else. If a person has only Imaan and <br>no other virtue in his account, sooner or later he is bound <br>(through the grace of Allah) to get admission into Paradise. <br>On the other hand, if a person does not possess Imaan. then <br>no amount of good deeds will be sufficient for his salva- <br>tion. <br>The second part of the above-mentioned hadith is that <br>the Kalimah does not let any sin remain unwashed. It is <br>unanimously agreed that if a person embraces Islam in his <br>old age, and immediately after recitation of the Kalimah he <br>happens to meet his death, then all his sins which he had <br>committed at 3 disbelievt before his declaration of Imaan <br>are remitted. If, however recitation of the Kalinlah in an <br>earlier stage is implied, then the hadith means that the <br>Kalimah purifies and polishes the heart, and its excessive <br>recitation will cleanse the heart, to such an extent that he <br>must do Taubah, which will result in the forgiveness of his <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>sins. According to one hadith, if a person is particular to <br>recite i19!iij before going to sleep and after getting up, <br>even his wordly affairs will lead to the betterment of his <br>life in the Hereafter, and he will be guarded against misfor- <br>tune and trouble. <br>HadithNo.40 <br>I<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Imaan has more than seventy (According to some, <br>! <br>seventy seven) branches, of which the most important <br>is the recitation of S I J ! ~ ! ~ ,  <br>one<br>and the least <br>is to <br>remove some obstacle (stone, wood, thorn, etc) from <br>the way; and modesty also is a special requisite of <br>Imaan.\" <br>Note: <br>, <br>Modesty has been specially mentioned, because it <br>serves as a safeguard against many sins like adultery, theft, <br>dirty talk, nakedness, abusive language, etc. Similarly, the <br>fear of bad reputation leads to virtuous acts: In fact, fear of <br>getting a bad name in this as well as in the next life actu- <br>ates a man towards all good deeds, including of course <br>Salaat, Hajj, Zakaat, etc, and obedience in all respects to <br>Almighty Allah. Thus, there is the well-known proverb, <br>\"Be shameless and do whatever you like.\" There is also <br>one hadith to this effect <br>&b <br>+Q +$ <br>\\i! <br>I <br>\"If <br>ou do not feel ashamed, you will do whatever you <br>like.\" Tie fgct is that we abstain from misdeeds for fear of <br>disgrace and shame. A sense of modesty and shame makes <br>one think, \"If I do not offer salaat, I will face disgrace in the <br>Hereafter.\" But if one has lost all sense of shame, he will <br>say \"What does it matter if others call me low?\" <br><br> <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 181 <br>According to the above-mentioned hadith, there are <br>more than seventy branches of Imaan. In many ehadith, this <br>number is given as seventy-seven. Scholars have written <br>detailed commentaries on these seventy seven branches. <br>Imam Abu Haatim bin Hibbaan (Rahmatullah alaih) wrote, <br>\"I contemplated on the meaning of this hadith for a long <br>time. When I counted the forms of prayers, the number far <br>exceeded seventy-seven. If I counted the things which are <br>specially mentioned in the ahaadith as branches of Imaan, <br>their number was less. The things counted as part of Imaan <br>in the Holy Qur'an would also total less than this. I, how- <br>ever, found that the total of such things mentioned in both <br>the Qur'an as well as the hadith, agreed with this number. I <br>therefore concluded that the above-mentioned hadith im- <br>plied all these things.\" <br>w0 <br>Qaadhi Iyaadh (Rahmatullah alaih) writes, some people <br>have made special efforts to give details of these branches <br>of Imaan by means of Ijtihaad, but failure to know all these <br>details does not mean any defect in one's Imaan, as its <br>basic principles (with their details) are so well known. <br>Khattaabi (Rahmatullah alaih) says that full details of the <br>exact number is known only to Allah and His Apostle, but <br>they are there in the Islamic Code (Sharist), and therefore <br>it does not matter if their details are not known. <br>Imaam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) has written that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said that Kali- <br>mah Tauheed i.e. $1 J!d!9, is the most important branch of <br>Imaan. This proves that it is the highest thing in Imaan, <br>and that no other branch of Imaan is superior to it. Thus, <br>belief in Tauheed is the most important essential of Imaan <br>and is incumbent on every believcr. The least thing (in the <br>order of merit) is the removal of anything that is likely to <br>cause obstruction or inconvenience to any Muslim. The <br>degree of importance of all the remaining essentials of <br>Imaan lies in betweeen the two; it is enough to believe in <br>them in a general way just as it is necessary to believe in <br>the angels in a general way without knowing their names <br>and details. Some Mohaddiths have however written books <br>about their details. Abu Abdullah Haleemi (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) wrote a book, Fawaaidul Minhaaj on this topic, <br>Imam Bayhaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) and Shaikh Abdul <br>Jaleel (Rahmatullah alaih) wrote books which they called <br>Shu-abul Imaan. Ishaaq Qurtubi (Rahmatullah alaih) wrote <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Kitabm Nasaa-'ih and Imam Abu Haatim wrote \"Wasful <br>Imaa-,wa Shu-abihi.\" <br>Tne commentators of Bukhari, the most famous collec- <br>tion of ahaadith, have summarised the contents of these <br>books at one place. The gist of this summary is that com- <br>plete Imaan in reality consists of three components: firstly. <br>confirmation by heart of all the essentials of Imaan, sec- <br>ondly, confirmation by word of mouth; and thirdly, confir- <br>mation by our physical actions. Thus, the branches of <br>Imaan are divided into three categories. the first of which <br>concern the intention, belief and action of the heart, the <br>second concern the use of the tongue, and the third con- <br>cern all the remaining parts of the body. All the things of <br>Imaan are included in these three categories. The first cat- <br>egory includes thirty articles of faith, as follows: <br>1. To believe in Allah-In His Being and His Attri- <br>butes, and that He is One, has no partner, and that <br>there is no one like Him. <br>2. \t To believe that all things except Him, were created <br>afterwards by Him, and that only He has been <br>there forever. <br>3. \t To believe in the Angels. <br>4. \t To believe in the revealed Books. <br>5. \t To believe in the Apostles of Allah. <br>6. \t To believe in Destiny, i.e. whether good or bad, it <br>is ordained by Allah. <br>7. \t To believe in the life after death, including inter- <br>rogation in the grave, punishment in the grave, <br>resurrection, the Day of Judgement, rendering ac- <br>count of ones deeds, and passing over the Bridge <br>of Siraat. <br>8. \t To believe in the existence of Paradise, and that <br>(by the grace of Almighty Allah) the Believers will <br>live in it forever. <br>9. \t To believe in the existence of Hell, with its <br>severest punishments, and that it will last for ever. <br>10. \tTo love Almighty Allah. <br>11. To love or hate other people for the pleasure of <br>Allah (i.e. to love the pious and hate the disobe- <br>dient ones). It includes, of course, loving the Saha- <br>bas, specially Muhajirs, Ansars, and descendants <br>of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>12. \t To love Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>which include cherishing the highest esteem for <br>him, offering Durood on him, and following the <br>Sunnah i.e. his way of life. <br>13. \t To practise Ikhlaas. which includes avoiding show <br>and hypocrisy. <br>14. \t To make Taubah i.e. to repent over one's sins from <br>the core of the heart, and to be determined not to <br>repeat them. <br>15. \t To fear Almighty Allah. <br>16. \t To hope and pray for the mercy of Allah. <br>17. \t Not to despair of Almighty Allah's mercy. <br>(r0 <br>L<br>18. \t To remain thankful to Allah. <br>$3 <br>Z N<br>19. \t To be faithful in one's promise. <br>20. \t To exercise patience. <br>21. \t To show humility, which includes respect for the <br>elders. <br>22. \t To show kindness and pity, which includes kind- <br>ness to children. <br>23. \t To be resigned to one's fate. <br>24. \t To practise tawakkul i.e. to depend on Almighty <br>Allah. <br>25. \t To refrain from self-praise and self-aggrandise-<br>ment. This includes self reformation also. . <br>26. \t Not to harbour rancour and jealousy against <br>others. <br>27. \t To cultivate modesty. <br>28. \t To restrain one's rage. <br>29. \t Not to deceive, cheat or suspect others. <br>30. \t To expel from one's heart the love of the worldly <br>things, including that for wealth and status. <br>According to Allamah Ainee, (Rahmatullah alaih) this <br>list covers all the functions of the heart. If anything is <br>found apparently missing, a little thought will show that it <br>is covered by one item or the other of this list. <br>The second category includes the functions of the <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>tongue, and there are seven essentials in this respect, as fol- <br>lows:-<br>1. \t Recitation of Kalimah Tayyibah. <br>2. \t<br>Recitation of the Holy Qur'an. <br>3. \t Acquisition of Ilm (religious knowledge). <br>- .  <br>4. \t<br>Propagation of religious knowledge to others. <br>5. \t Duaa, i.e. supplication. <br>6. \t Zikr of Allah, including Istighfaar. <br>7. \t<br>To abstain from loose and useless talk. <br>The third category includes bodily actions. In this re- <br>spect, there are forty essentials which are divided into <br>three parts. The first part which includes actions that relate <br>to the self or person of an individual. These are sixteen, as <br>follows:-<br>1. \t Observing cleanliness of body, clothes and place. <br>The cleanliness of body includes wudhu and <br>obligatory bath, purification from menstruation <br>and post-birth blood. <br>2. \t Offering salaat, including fardh, nafl and qadhaa <br>salaat. This would mean offering and fulfilling its <br>pre-requisites. <br>3. \t Giving sadaqah (charity), which includes zakaat, <br>Sadaqatul-Fitr, voluntary alms, feeding people, en- <br>tertaining guests, and liberating slaves. <br>4. \t Fasting, obligatory as well non-obligatory. <br>5. \t Performing Hajj, obligatory or non-obligatory. It in- <br>cludes making Umrah and Tawaaf. <br>6. \t I'tikaaf (remaining in a mosque in full devotion), <br>which includes search for Lailatul Qadr. <br>7. \t Leaving one's home for the defence of the Deen. <br>This includes Hijrat (migratioq for the sake of <br>Allah). <br>8. \t Fulfilling one's offerings. <br>9. \t Steadfastness in one's oaths. <br>10. \t Payment of atonement money, if due. <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 165 <br>11. Covering the essential parts of the body, as re- <br>auired bv Islam, during salaat and outside salaat. <br>12. \t Offering of sacrifice and taking care of animals to <br>be offered. <br>13. \t Making arrangements for the funeral. <br>14. \t Payment of debt. <br>15. \t Rectitude in dealings, and abstaining from usury. <br>16. \t Giving correct evidence, and not concealing the <br>truth. <br>The second part, which includes action involving treat- <br>ment with one's relatives and others, has six essentials:- <br>CI0<br>1. Getting married as a safeguard against adultery. <br>V) L.<br>5 %<br>2. To discharge obligation towards one's family <br>E N  <br>members, servants and subordinates. \t<br>3. \t Good treatment towards one's parents, and being <br>kind and obedient to them. <br>4. \t Bringing up one's children in a proper way. <br>5. \t Remaining on good terms with one's relatives. <br>6 .  \tObeying one's elders, and following their advice. <br>The third part includes eighteen essentials, which re- <br>lates to our social obligations to society in general:- <br>1. \t To rule one's domain with justice. <br>2. \t To support the right party. <br>3. \t To obey the rulers, provided their orders are not <br>against religion. <br>4. \t To work for the betterment of mutual relations, in- <br>cluding punishing the wrong-doers and making <br>Jihaad against the rebels. <br>5. \t To help others in their noble deeds. <br>6. \tTo enjoin the good and forbid the evil; it includes <br>work and speech for propagation of religion. <br>7. \t To carry out the punishments enjoined by religion <br>(for specific offences). <br>8. \t To take part in Jihaad i.e. to fight in the path of <br>Allah. It includes guarding the defence lines. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>9. \t To pay off our dues and return amaanats; this in- <br>cludes payment of Khums (payment of tax equal to <br>one fifth of the booty). <br>10. \t To lend (to the needy) and to pay back the debt. <br>11. \t To discharge our obligations to our neighbours, <br>and to be kind and helpful to them. <br>12. \t To be fair in one's business dealings; it includes <br>savings and earnings in a lawful manner. <br>13. \t To be careful in expenditure: one should guard <br>against extravagence as well as miserliness. <br>14. \t To make salaam and respond to the salaam. <br>15. \t To say <br>(May Allah have mercy on you)<br>when somebody happens to sneeze. <br>16. \t Not to be the cause of trouble and loss to others. <br>17. \t To avoid idle and useless pursuits. <br>18. \t To clear troublesome obstructions from the way. <br>The seventy-seven branches of Imaan have been <br>counted above. Some of these can be merged together. as <br>for example earning and spending can be put together. <br>under fair dealings. Careful consideration can enable one to <br>cut down the total to seventy or sixty-seven, the numbers <br>given in some ahaadith. <br>The above list has been prepared mainly from the com- <br>mentary of Allamah Ainee (Rahmatullah alaih) on Bukhari <br>Shareef, wherein these things are mentioned in their order <br>of merit. Selection has been made also from other books, <br>i.e. Fathul-Baari of Ibn Hajar and Mirqaat of Allamah Qari. <br>Scholars have written that the implied essen:ia., of <br>Imaan are as given above. One should ponder over these, <br>and be thankful to Almighty Allah for the good qualities <br>acquired already, because all goodness is possible only <br>through His grace and mercy. In case of deficiency in re- <br>spect of any quality, one should strive for it and keep on <br>praying that Almighty Allah may grace him with His bless- <br>ings. <br><br>- - <br>CHAPTER 111 <br>(The Third Kalimah) <br>. -\t . <br>i.p.. \t $ , i \\ j ' h \\ ~ ! d ! ~ j + ,<br>The virtues of the third Kalimah, <br>d l jL;I*;) which. according to some narrations is also fol- <br>lowed by j k i !  i;iyj ~ p y , ,are described in this chapter. These <br>. . <br>words are also known as Tasbihaali-l'atimah, because the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had advised his most <br>beloved daughter. Hadhrat Fatimah (Kadhiyallaho anha) to <br>recite these regularly, as will be described later on. As <br>there are many verses of the Holy Qur'an and several aha- <br>dith in respect of this Kalimah, this chapter is divided into <br>two parts. The first part contains the Qur'anic verses. and <br>the second part the sayings of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). <br>PART I <br>This part includes the verses of the Holy Book that <br>relate to the Kalimah <br>As a rule. the greater the importallce of the subject matter. <br>the stress on the method of describing it, make it thor- <br>oughly understood. That is why the meanings and signifi- <br>cances of these words have been explained in various ways <br>in the Holy Qur'an. <br>The first of these phrases is (i~sI*;,. It means that <br>Almighty Allah is free from all defects and shortcomings. <br>and it is a declaratioll of firm belief in His being so. <br>Almighty Allah has ordered its recitation, and has also in-<br>formed us that the angels and all other creation remain <br>busy in reciting it. Such is also the case with the other <br>words of this Kalimah, ill that their significance and im- <br>portance is stressed in so many ways in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>1. (At the time of creation of man, the angels had <br>said,) \"We hymn Thy Praise, glorify and revere <br>Thee.\" <br>2. (When the angels were put to a test vis-a-vis the <br>first man, they submitted,) \"Glory be to Thee. We <br>have no knowledge save that which Thou hast <br>taught us; Thou art the Knower and the Wise.\" <br>I <br>3. Remember Thy Lord exceedingly, and praise<br>(Him) in the early hours of night and morning. <br>4. (Wise men are those who remain busy in the zikr <br>of Allah, and ponder over the wonders of Nature <br>and say,) \"0,Lord! Thou created this not in vain, <br>Glory be to Thee; preserve us from the doom of <br>fire.\" <br>I <br>5. Far removed it is from His Transcendant Majesty <br>that He should have a son. <br>6. (On the day of judgement when Allah would en- <br>quire from Hadhrat Eesaa (Alayhis salaam) <br>whether he had preached to his followers the faith <br>in Trinity, he would say,) \"Allah Be glorified; it <br>was not for me to utter that which I had no right.\" <br>I <br>7. Glorified be He and exalted high above (all) they <br>(Unbelievers) ascribe unto Him. <br><br>Ch. 111: Ayuut mentioning Third Kulimuh <br>8. (When on the mountain of Toor, Hadhrat Moosa, <br>(Alayhis salaam) could not withstand even a <br>glimpse of Allah's glory and became senseless), <br>and when he woke up he said, \"Glory unto 'Thee; I <br>turn unto Thee repentant, and I am the first of true <br>believers. <br>9. Lo! those who are with thy Lord (i.e. angels) are <br>not too proud to do Him service, but they praise <br>Him and adore Him alone. <br>The Sufis have written that the mention of the <br>negation of pride before anything else implies that <br>to be free from pride is a pre-requisite for con- <br>stancy in prayers, and that pride makes one neg- <br>lectful in prayers. <br>10. Be He glorified above all that they (unbelievers) <br>ascribe as partners (unto Him). <br>VI I. <br>g 2 <br>Z N  <br>+i?,$i21, +%Q +&+, 9,,SJG q\\$j(71 <br>(,& A)A d \\;j <br>L, * <br>'11. Their (i.e. of dwellers of Paradise) prayers therein <br>will be \"Glory be to Thee, Allah\", and their greet- <br>ings therein (among themselves) will be \"Peace,\" <br>and the conclusion of their prayer wil be \"Praise <br>be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.\" <br>12. Praised be He and exalted above all that ye (non- <br>believers) associate with Him. <br>Virtues of Zikr \t<br>13. They say, Allah had taken (unto Him) a son. Glori- \t<br>fied be He; He hath no needs. <br>14. \t Glory be to Allah, and I am not of the idolators. <br>15. And the thunder (angel) hymneth His praise, and <br>(so do) the other angels for awe of Him. It is stated <br>by the scholars that if anybody on hearing the <br>thunder recites <br>he will be immune from the ill consequences <br>of lightening. It is narrated in one hadith, \"Make <br>zikr of Allah when you hear the thunder of <br>lightening, because it cannot harm one who is <br>doing zikr.\" It is narrated in another hadith, \"At <br>the time of thunder- say (&) <br>(Subhanallah) and <br>not (9)<br>(Allaho- Akbar). <br>I <br>16.

Those who hvmn His <br>praise have been eulogised in manv of the ahadith. Accord- <br>ing to one hadith, the first to be called for admittance into <br>Paradise will be those who used to hymn His praise under <br>all circumstances, whether favourable or adverse. It is <br>stated in another hadith that Almighty Allah likes recita- <br>tion of His praises. As a matter of fact, it ought to be so, be- <br>CI <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>cause He alone is worthy of real praise. Nobody else <br>(really) deserves praise, because nobody has real control <br>over anything, not even over his own person. <br>It is narrated in one hadith that the luckiest perLons on <br>the Day of Resurrection will be those who hymn Allah's <br>praise excessively. According to one hadith, recitation of <br>Allah's praise is in reality expression of one's gratitude to <br>Him, and one who does not recite His praise has not ex- <br>pressed his thanks to Him. It is stated in one hadith that re- <br>citing Allah's praise on receipt of any bounty acts as a <br>safeguard against its loss. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) is stated to have said, \"Saying (h.JA1) by anyone <br>from my IJmmat is more beneficial to him than his getting <br>possession of the whole world.\" <br>It is narrated in one hadith that when Allah bestows a <br>bounty on some one and thereupon that person recites His <br>Praise, this act on his part surpasses the value of that <br>bounty, however big it might be. <br>A Sahabi while sitting near Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) happened to recite in a low voice <br>The holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) enquired as <br>to who had recited that duaa. Thinking that he had done <br>something which he should not have done at that time, the <br>Sahabi kept quiet. Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>assured that there was no harm in telling it, because it was <br>not anything undesirable, after which the Sahabi admitted <br>that the duaa had been uttered by him. Then Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I saw thirteen angels, all <br>of whom were trying to surpass each other in carrying this <br>duaa to Almighty Allah.\" <br>And there is the well-known hadith, wherein it is <br>stated that an undertaking, which may be very grand other- <br>wise, will lack Allah's blessing unless praise of Allah is re- <br>cited at the time of its commencement. Hence it is that <br>every book is commenced with the praise of Almighty <br>Allah. <br>It is narrated in one hadith that when a child dies, <br>Almighty Allah asks the angels if they have taken out the <br>soul of His bondman's child. On receiving the reply in the <br>affirmative, He adds that they have taken out (so to say) a <br>part of his heart. Almighty Allah then enquires \"what did <br><br>my bondsman say on that?' They say, \"He praised You and <br>recited (ij+\\jJ!c!j$sfl!) (We belong to Allah, and to Him we <br>shall return). On this, Almighty Allah orders that a house <br>for him should be built in Paradise, and that it should be <br>named Bait-ul-Hamd (House of Praise). According to an- <br>other hadith, Allah is greatly pleased with a person who <br>says &I;;ji) <br>on eating a morsel of food or on getting a drink <br>of water. <br>The third part of this Kalimah is &i!ii~J, which has <br>been described in detail in the l?sichapter. The fourth part <br>is known as Kalimah Takbeer (3141) which means acclama- <br>tion of His greatness and affirmation of His grandeur and <br>His splendour. The importance of this fourth part of the <br>Kalimah has also been described in many of the verses <br>given already; there are other ayaat which specifically, de- <br>scribe the greatness and grandeur of Almighty Allah. These <br>g 5 <br>E N<br>are as follows:- <br>1. \t That ye should glorify Allah for having guided <br>you, and that peradventure ye may be thankful. <br>2. \t<br>He is the knower of the invisible and the visible <br>the Great, the most High. <br>3. \t<br>Thus We made (the sacrificial animals) subject <br>unto you that ye may glorify Allah. that He hath <br>guided you. And give good tidings (O'Muhammad) <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to the doers of good <br>deeds. <br>4 & 5. And indeed Allah, He is the High and the <br>Great. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>6. \t (When the angels receive any commandment they <br>get upset because of fear) Yet when fear is re-<br>moved from their (angels) hearts (on descending of <br>revelation), they say: \"What was that which your <br>Lord said?\" They say: \"The truth, and He is the <br>Sublime, the Great.\" <br>7. \t So, the command belongeth only to Allah, the <br>Sublime, the Majestic. <br>8. \t And unto Him (alone belorigeth Majestv in the <br>Heavens and the Earth, and He is the Mighty, the <br>Wise. <br>9. \t<br>He is Allah, other than Whom there is no Cod. the <br>Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, Bestower of peace. <br>the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Majestic, <br>the Compeller, the Superb. <br>The avaats given above describe the greatness and <br>grandeur of Almightv Allah, and contain commandment <br>and persuasion for recounting it. In many of ahadith too <br>commandment and persuasion for reciting Allah's Great- <br>ness has been stressed. It is stated in one hadith, \"When <br>you see that fire has broken, out somewhere, hymn (21<br>excessi\\rely, which will put out the fire.\" Another hadith <br>also states that recitation of c;jiii,puts out the fire. It is said <br>in one hadith that when a person sa!.s <br>$1 <br>31 its Noor (Light) <br>covers everything between the Earth and the sky. Accord- <br>ing to one hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br><br>has said, \"Hadhrat Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) conveyed to <br>me the order for reciting the Greatness of Allah.\" <br>In addition to the ayaats and ahadith given above, <br>Allah's greatness and His splendour has been desribed, and <br>recitation of it has been stressed under different headings <br>and in different words at many places in the Holy Qur'an. <br>There are also many other ayaats, which do not contain the <br>specific words of these Kalimah, but they imply these Kali- <br>mahs. Some of these ayaats are as follows: <br>1. \t Then Aadam received from his Lord some words <br>(of revelation), and His Lord turned towards him, <br>for He is the Relenting, the Merciful. <br>,Ao ,-<br>There are different versions and explanations about the I# <br>words refered to in this ayat. According to some of these <br>versions, these words were as follows: <br>(a) (There is no Allah except Thee) You are above all <br>shortcomings and are worthy of all kinds of praise. <br>O! mv Lord. I have acted viciously and wronged <br>myself; therefore forgive me, surely you are the <br>best of forgivers. <br>(b) There is no Allah except Thee. You are above all <br>defects: you are worthy of all praise. O! my Lord. I <br>have acted viciously and wronged mvself; kindlv <br>show mercv upon me. surely You are most Com- <br>passionate, most Merciful. <br>(c) There is no Allah except Thee. You are above all <br>defects and shortcomings, and are worthy of all <br>praise. O! my Lord. I have acted viciously and <br>wronged mvself: relent towards me, as You are Re- <br>lenting ilnd Merciful. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>There are other ahadith of similar nature, as narrated <br>by Allamah Soyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) in 'Durrul Man- <br>thoor' wherein words meaning glorification and hymning <br>praise of Allah occur. <br>2. \t<br>Whosoever bringeth a good deed will receive ten- <br>fold the like thereof, while whosoever bringeth an <br>ill deed will be awarded like thereof, and they will <br>not be wronged. <br>Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"There <br>are two routines, which if followed by a Muslin1 will <br>enable him to enter into Paradise. Both the routines are <br>very easy, but there are very few people, who act according <br>to them.

(L&i) <br>thirty three times, and <br>thirty three times at .the time of going to bed evzry ntght. <br>Orie glorifies Allah one hundred times in this way, and <br>earns. one thousand virtues thereby. Thus, the virtues <br>earned during the day total two thousand and five hull- <br>dred. On the l)av of Judgement. when deeds will .be <br>weighed, will there be anybody who will have committed <br>everyday two thousand and five hundred evil deeds, which <br>can counter-act as many virtues'?\" <br>Although among the Sahaba. there was likely to be <br>~loilewho c:ould have done two thousand and five hundred <br>evil deeds during a day, yet in this age our daily misdeeds <br>far exceed this number. Thus. it was extrenlely kind of Ka- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have told us the <br>presc:riptio~~for illcreasillg our good deeds over our mis- <br>deeds. It is upto the patient to act upon it. <br>Acc:ording to one haditti, the companions of Kaslllul- <br>lah (Faltallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him the reason why <br>.o~ilyo few people are able to act upon the above nlentioned <br>I\\ro things in spite of their being so easy. He replied that at <br>night the devil makes one to sleep before he has recitetl it <br><br>Ch. Ill: A!,c~trl men1ioning 'l'hil.tl Kulinic~h <br>and at time of Salaat he reminds him of something which <br>actuates him to get up and go away at once without having <br>recited it. <br>According to one hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>was all an^) said, \"Is it not possible for you to earn even one <br>thousand virtues every day? Someone enquired, \"How can <br>we earn one thousand virtues daily 0' Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam?\" He replied, \"Recite cbSI;.;;)one <br>hundred times, and you will have earned one thbusand vir- <br>tues.'; <br>CI <br>3. \t<br>Wealth and children are the ornaments of the <br>g, i <br>earthly life.

Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasa1,Ianl) re- <br>plied, \"It is to recite Takbeer ($ %) , Tahleel 41g! il!j,.

To Him belong the keys of heavens and the earth. <br>It was narrated by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that in reply to his enquiry about (9>1j+&JIq\\i;) <br>(keys of heavens and the earth), Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had said that it was <br>According to another hadith, the keys of heavens and <br>the earth means Cj'i %;I J! j!JL d iLI <br>which had been <br>sent down from the treasure oft-he ~ r s h  <br>i.e. Allah's Throne. <br>6. \t To Him go up their good kalimahs, and good <br>deeds carry them there. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood, (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said, \"Whenever I recite some hadith, I also quote from the <br>Holy Qur'an in support thereof. When a Muslim hymns <br>an angel carefully takes the words, towards heaven in his <br>wings, and whichever sky he crosses, its angels pray for the <br><br>Ch.

Hadhrat Ka'ab, (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had said that hymning of <br>goes buzzing round the Arsh and therein mentions the <br>name of the reciter. Another Sahabi narrated a similar <br>hadith. <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>PART I1 <br>This part deals with the ahadith in which Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) mentioned the virtues of these <br>kalimahs and recommended their recitation. <br>Hadith No 1 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"There are two kalimahs which are verv light for the <br>tongue (i.e. easy to utter) but very weighty in reward and <br>very pleasing to Allah: These are <br>&I b<br>G *j <br>&I <br>(Glory to Allah with all praises, ~ l o r j t o  <br>~ l l a h , t h eMa-<br>jestic).\" <br>Light for the tongue means that these kalimahs are so <br>brief that no time is spent in their recitation and no diffi- <br>culty is experienced in memorizing them. In spite of their <br>being so easy, they will be found very weighty when good <br>deeds will be weighed. Then the fact that they are dear to <br>Allah more than anything else, surpasses all other advan- <br>tages. Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullah alaih) concluded his <br>book \"Sahih Btukhari\" with these two kalimahs, and the <br>above mentioned hadith was given at the end of the book. <br>According to one hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) had said, \"None of you should miss earning one <br>thousand virtues every day. Hymn (++jJllirG) one hun- <br>dred times and you will get one thousand virtues. Through <br>Allah's grace, your daily sins will be less than this number. <br>Then the reward of your good deeds, other than reciting <br>this kalimah, will be in addition.\" According to another <br>hadith a person who recites (+++j+St&) <br>one hundred <br>times in the morning and in the evening has all his sins for- <br>given, even if they exceed the foam on the sea. It is stated in <br>one hadith that recitation of &ihi31i!d!9 iiW'iiilL G )  causes <br>.. <br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>the sins to fall off like the leaves of trees (during the winter <br>season). <br>Hadith No 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that once Rasulullah (Sallallnho alaihe wasallain) had <br>said, \"Should I tell you what speech is most liked by <br>Allah?\" \"Do tell me\", said I. He said \"It <br>is <br>(u;irj+1 I)'+) <br>.\" In another hadith, it isp3;;rj sib G ) .  An-<br>other hadith relates, \"The thing that Allah ordered His <br>angels to hymn is undoubtedly the best one, and it is <br>(,J.+j +l b G )<br>,, <br>It is mentioned in several ayaat given in Part I that the <br>angels, those near the Arsh and all others, remain ever <br>hymning the glory and praise of Almighty Allah, which is <br>their sole occupation. This is why, when Allah created <br>Aadam (Alayhis salaam) the angels submitted, \"We hymn <br>Thy praise and glorify Thee(J jUjO++>),\" <br>as given <br>in the first ayat in Part I. According to one hadith, Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"The heaven <br>crackles due to the awe of Allah's greatness, as does a bed- <br>stead under a heavy weight, and the Heaven is justified in <br>doing so. I swear by Allah, Who controls my life, that in <br>the Heaven there is not an inch of space where some angel <br>is not prostrating and hymning the glory and praise of <br>Almighty Allah.\" <br>Hadith No. 3 <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever says 41J!ii!$<br>his admittance into Paradise is <br>guaranteed, and whosoever hymns one hundred times, <br>j <br>G he is credited with one hundred and <br>twenty four thousand virtues.\" The Sahaba said, \"0, <br>Rasulullah! (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if such is the <br>case, then nodoby will be doomed to destruction on <br>the Day of Judgement because the virtues are sure to <br>outweigh the sins.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said, \"Some people will even then be doomed <br>to destruction because some people will have so many <br>virtues that a mountain may crumble under their <br>weight, but these will be just nothing in comparison <br>with Allah's bounties. However, Almighty Allah, out <br>of His extreme mercy and grace, will rescue them.\" <br>Note: <br>The largest number of virtues will look like nothing as <br>compared with the bounties of Allah, shows that whereas <br>virtues and sins will be weighed on the Day of Judgement, <br>a person will also be called to account whether he had <br>made proper use of Allah's bounties and had shown grati- <br>tude to Him. As a matter of fact, everything we have is <br>granted by Almighty Allah, and for each thing we owe a <br>duty, and it will be checked whether we have discharged <br>this duty properly. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>had said, \" <br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>which means that it is obligatory on a person to give, every <br>morning, a sadaqah (offering) in respect of every joint and <br>bone. According to another hadith, there are three hundred <br>and sixty joints in the human body, and it is obligatory on <br>a person to give a sadaqah in respect of each joint. This is a <br>token of gratitude to Almighty Allah, that after the night's <br>sleep (which is akin to death) Almighty Allah gave him life <br>again, with each part of the body in good order.\" The Saha- <br>bas (Radhiyallaho anhum) submitted, \"Who can afford to <br>do so many sadaqahs every day?\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Saying (wis a sadaqah, saying <br>4)is sadaqah, saying $1 i!i!J, is sadaqah, saying $31 is <br>sadaqah, removing some obstacle from the way is sadaqah <br>(and so on).\" In short, he enumerated several such items of <br>sadaqah. There are other ahadith like this, wherein Allah's <br>$ <br>bounties in one's own person are enumerated, and then <br>, <br>there are, in addition, the bounties in respect of food. $3 <br>drink, comfort, and so many other blessings of Allah. <br>This subject is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an in Surah <br>at-Takaathur: that on the Day of Judgement, one will be <br>questioned about the bounties of Allah. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>stated that one will be reminded about the health of his <br>body, of his ears, of his eyes, that Almighty Allah had be- <br>stowed all such bounties out of sheer mercy: and a person <br>will be questioned how he used these for the service of <br>Allah, or whether he used them like the animals for his <br>own self. Thus in the Holy Qur'an in Surah Bani Israa-eel, <br>Allah says, <br>the hearing and the sight, and the heart; of each of them <br>will be asked, i.e. everybody will be required to render ac- <br>count for the proper use of his ears, eyes, and heart. The <br>holy Prophet. (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked that <br>the bounties about which one will be questioned include <br>peace of mind. which is a great blessing, and also physical <br>health. Mujahid has stated that every worldly pleasure is a <br>bounty. for which one will have to give account. Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said that security is one of the <br>bounties of Allah. A person asked Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) the meaning of the ayat <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>(then on the Day, you will be questioned about the boun- <br>ties). He replied that one will be questioned about the <br>wheat bread eaten and of cold water, as well as about the <br>house in which one lived. It is stated in one hadith that, <br>when this ayat was revealed, some Sahaba (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum) said, \"0,Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>what are the bounties about which we shall be questibned? <br>We get only half a meal and that too of barley bread.\" Then <br>came the revelation, \"Do you not put on shoes? Do you not <br>drink cold water? These are also bounties of Allah.\" <br>According to one hadith, when this ayat was revealed, <br>some Sahabas said, \"0,Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), about what bounties shall we be questioned? We <br>get only dates to eat and water to drink, and we have to <br>remain always with our swords on our shoulders, ready to <br>fight! some enemy (on account of which even these two <br>things cannot be enjoyed by us in peace).\" Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"The bounties are about <br>to become available in the near future.\" <br>It is stated in one hadith that Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had said, \"Of the bounties to be ac-<br>counted for on the Day of Judgement, the first is the physi- <br>cal health, (i.e. whether we discharged our obligation in <br>respect of it, and did any service for the pleasure of Allah) <br>and the other is the cold drinking-water.\" Cold water is, in <br>fact, a great gift of Allah, and is realised as such where it is <br>not (readily) available. It is indeed a great blessing of Allah, <br>but we never even acknowledge it to be as such; not to <br>speak of thanking Almighty Allah for it and discharging <br>our duty in respect of it. <br>It is said in one hadith, \"The bounties to he accounted <br>for include the piece of bread eaten to satisfy the hunger, <br>the water drunk to quench the thirst, and the cloth used to <br>cover the body.\" <br>Once at midday when it was very hot, Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) felt famished and went out of his <br>house. Soon after his arrival in the mosque, Hadhrat Umar <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also reached there in similar con-<br>dition, and asked him how he was there at that time. \"My <br>hunger has become unbearable\", was the reply. Hadhrat <br>Umar said, \"By Allah, the same thing has compelled me to <br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>come out.\" The two were talking thus, when Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) also came there, and asked <br>them how they were there. They submitted, \"Hunger made <br>us restless and compelled us to come out here.\" Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I have come here for the <br>same reason.\" All the three then went to the house of <br>Hadhrat Abu Ayub Ansari (Radhiyallaho anho). He was not <br>in, and his wife welcomed them; she was overjoyed to have <br>them in her house. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>enquired about Abu Ayub; she replied that he had gone out <br>for something and would soon be back. After a little while, <br>Hadhrat Abu Ayub (Radhiyallaho anho) also came back. <br>On seeing them, he was overwhelmed with joy, and cut a <br>big bunch of dates to entertain them. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) remarked, \"Why did you cut the whole <br>%<br>bunch. The raw and the half-ripe dates have also been cut <br>thereby. You could have selected and plucked the ripe <br>!$ <br>ones only.\" He submitted, \"I plucked the whole bunch so <br>t N <br>that all kind of dates may be before you, and you may eat <br>the kind you may like.\" (Sometimes, one likes the half ripe <br>dates in preference to the ripe ones). Leaving the dates <br>before them, he slaughtered a small goat, roasted some of <br>its meat, and cooked the rest. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) took some bread and a piece of roasted meat, <br>and giving it to Abu Ayub said, \"Take this to Fatimah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha); she also did not get anything to eat for sev- <br>eral days.\" Hadhrat Abu Ayub (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>hastened to comply with the orders and then returned. All <br>of them ate to their hearts' content. Then Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"See, these are the bounties <br>of Allah: the bread, the meat, the raw dates and the ripe <br>ones.\" While uttering these words, tears came in his eyes <br>and' then he said, \"By Allah! Who controls my life; these <br>are the bounties about which one will he questioned on the <br>Day of Judgement.\" Considering the circumstances under <br>which these things had become available, the Sahabas felt <br>perplexed and worried that account was required to be ren- <br>dered for these things, which became available under such <br>critical conditions of helplessness. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said, \"It is necessary to express our grati- <br>tude to Almighty Allah. When you put your hand on such <br>things, say (&I +J <br>before starting to eat and <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I <br>(All praise is for Allah who feasted us to the full, and did <br>favour on us, and bestowed upon us plentifully) after you <br>finish eating. Its recitation will suffice as your expression <br>of gratitude.\" Many incidents of this nature are narrated <br>under different headings in the books of hadith. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said the same things when he <br>happened to visit the house of Abul Haitham Maaiik bin <br>Tayhaan (Radhiyallaho anho) and once when he visited a <br>I <br>I <br>Sahabi whose name was Waqfi (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) came across a <br>leper who was blind, deaf and dumb. He said to his com- <br>panions, \"Do you see any bounties of Allah on this <br>person?\" \"Apparently none,\" they replied. \"Can he not uri- <br>nate easily?\" said Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said, \"On the Day of Judgement there will be three courts. <br>In one of these, the accounts of virtues will be scrutinized, <br>in the second Allah's bounties will be counted, and in the <br>third the sins will be accounted for. The virtues will be <br>counterbalanced by the bounties of Allah, so the sins will <br>remain outstanding and their disposal will depend on <br>Allah's mercy.\" <br>All this means that a man is duty bound to show his <br>gratitude to Almighty Allah for His unlimited favours at all <br>times and under all conditions. Therefore, he should strive <br>his utmost to earn as many virtues as possible and should <br>not rest content at any stage, because it will be on the Day <br>of Judgement that he will realize how many sins had been <br>committed unknowingly through his eyes, nose, ears, and <br>other parts of the body. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) had said, \"Everyone of you will have to appear <br>before Almighty Allah, you will be face to face with Him, <br>with no curtain in between. There will be no lawyer or in- <br>terpreter to advocate your cause; there will be heaps of <br>your deeds on either side. The fire of Hell will be in front <br>of you, and therefore you should trv your best to ward off <br>this fire through sadaqah, (voluntarv charity) which may be <br>as paltry as a single date.\" It is stated in one hadith, \"On <br>the Day of Judgement, you will first be reminded how you <br>were blessed with good health and were given cold water <br>to drink\" (which implies. whether you showed gratitude <br>for these favours). According to another hadith, \"You will <br>not be allowed to move away from the court of Allah until <br>you have answered five questions: (1)How did you spend <br><br>Ch. III: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>your life? (2) How did you utilize your youth? (3)How did <br>you earn your wealth? (4) How did you spend it? (i.e. <br>whether earning and spending was in a lawful manner). (5) <br>How did you act upon your acquired knowledge?\" <br>Hadith No.4 <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) savs, <br>\"When on the night of Mi'raaj 1 met I-ladhrat Ibrahim <br>(Alayhis salaam) he asked me to convev his salam to <br>my Ummat and tell them that the soil of Paradise is <br>very fine and fertile and there is very good water to <br>irrigate it, but the land is all a virgin plain and its <br>plants are <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>so that one can plant there as much as he likes.\" <br>According to one hadith, the above Kalimah is also fol- <br>lowed by !!i!i$Yj J; <br>Y . According to another hadith it was <br>said, \"A tree for every part of this Kalimah is planted in <br>Paradise \" It is stated in one hadith, \"Whosoever recites <br>e & j A l b G  <br>, a tree is planted for him in Paradise.\" It is <br>stated in one hadith, \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was going somewhere when he saw that Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) was planting a \t tree. He asked him <br>what he was doing. \"I am planting a tree,\" was the reply. <br>Thereupon Rasulullah, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Should I tell you about the best plantation? It is <br>(9<br>ai 51j!ii!J3, UibLE+ <br>; the recitation of each of these <br>Kalimahs caises a tree to grow for you in Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) sent his salam <br>through Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to this <br>Ummat. The 'Alims' have written that whosoever hears this <br>hadith. should say in return ~<br>j<br>i<br>j<br>~<br>l<br>~<br>j<br>j<br>~<br>~<br>l<br>(May <br>peace be upon him as well as Allah's mercy and His bles- <br>sings). <br>The second thing mentioned in the hadith is that the <br>soil of Paradise is very fine and its water very sweet, which <br>can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, it is the description <br>of that place that it is extremely fine, its soil (according to <br>some ahadith) is of saffron and musk, and its water is very <br>sweet, so that everybody loves to have a house there; and <br>as it has all facilities for recreation and for planting gar- <br>dens, etc., nobody likes to leave it. The second interpreta- <br>tion is that where there is fine soil and excellent water, <br>there is always luxurious growth. In that case, it means that <br>hymning <br>once will cause a tree to be planted and <br>then, by virtue of the fertile soil and excellent water, this <br>tree will continue to grow by itself. Only the seed is re- <br>quired to be planted once: the growth afterwards is all <br>automatic. <br>In this hadith. Paradise is stated to have a treeless and <br>virgin soil. In other ahadith where Paradise has been de- <br>scribed it is stated that there are all kinds of fruit trees in it, <br>so much so that the literal meaning of the word Jannat <br>(Paradise) is \"garden\". There is thus a sort of contradiction: <br>.the (Jlarna explain that originally Paradise is a treeless <br>plain. but when it will be handed over to the various <br>people tht:y will find gardens and trees there, in accord- <br>l<br>j<br>~ <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>ance with their deeds. The second explanation by some <br>Ulama is that the gardens in the Paradise will be awarded <br>according to the deeds of good people, and as such it is the <br>deeds that are said to have caused these trees to grow for <br>them. The third explanation is that the smallest Paradise <br>that anybody will get will be bigger than the whole world, <br>and some parts of it are covered with original gardens and <br>other parts of it are without growth, so that trees will get <br>automatically planted there according to the Zikr and glori- <br>fication done by its recipient. Hadhrat Maulana Gangohi, <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) a great Shaikh and scholar, has stated <br>in his book Kaukabud Durree that all the trees are available <br>there in the form of a nursery, and are planted according to <br>the good deeds, after which they continue to grow. <br>* <br>Hadith No. 5 \t<br>8; <br>E N  <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"One <br>who is unable to toil at night i.e., he cannot keep <br>awake and pray at night, or is too miserly to spend <br>money, or is too cowardly to take part in Jihaad (fight- <br>ing in the path of Allah) should hymn (+&j &&,ex-<br>cessively, because this action is more vaiiable with <br>Allah than spending in His path a mountain load of <br>gold.\" <br>How great is the grace of Allah that even those who <br>cannot bear hardship in the path of Allah are not deprived <br>from earning virtues and huge rewards. One who cannot <br>keep awake at night, cannot spend in Allah's path and <br>cannot take part in religious fighting, because of co-wardice, <br>but still has value for Deen in his heart, and is anxious to <br>improve his life in the Hereafter, is still eligible to earn <br>Virtues of Zikr \t<br>Allah's favours. It is one's extreme misfortune if he cannot <br>do something even then. <br>Hadith No.6 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The <br>words most liked by Almighty Allah consist of four Kali- <br>mahs, viz; &i ji $ j!g A kiLIj&, which may be recited <br>in any sequence. ~ c c o r d i n ~  <br>to one hadith, these Kalimahs <br>are also mentioned in the Holy Qur'an. These Kalimahs <br>occur very frequently in the Holy Qur'an, wherein there is <br>the commandment and persuasion for their recitation, as <br>describsd in detail in Part I. In one hadith, it is stated, <br>\"Adorn the festivals of Eid with these words by their fre- <br>quent recitation.\" <br>Hadith No. 7 <br>a<br><br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>Once a group of poor Muhajirs came to Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, \"0 Rasulullah! <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) only the rich attain to the <br>higher spiritual grades, and the eternal bounties of <br>Allah fall only to their lot.\" \"How?\" enquired Kasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They replied, \"They <br>offer salaat and observe fasting in the same manner as <br>we do, but being rich they are able to perform other <br>b <br>good deeds, like giving sadaqah and freeing slaves, <br>g4<br>L <br>which we being poor are unable to do.\" Rasulullah <br>E N  <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"Should I tell you <br>something by acting upon which you may overtake <br>your predecessors and surpass your successors, and <br>nobody may be better than you unless he also acts <br>upon the same thing.\" \"Do tell us,\" said the Sahabas. <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum). \"Recite &iLi, A Ui, i,G) <br>thirty three times each after every salaat;'; said-Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They acted upon <br>his advice, but the rich of those days came to know of <br>it and started doing the same. The poor again came to <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and com-<br>plained. \"Our rich brothers have come to learn what <br>you told us, and are also acting upon it.\" Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then remarked, \"It is <br>Allah's favour which He bestows on whomsoever He <br>likes; nobody can stop Him.\" According to another <br>hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also <br>a \t<br>narrated to have said to them, \"Allah has also favoured <br>you with a substitute of sadaqah. Reciting ( a a G )  <br>once is sadaqah, saying (?.UI)<br>once is sadaqah, inter- <br>course with one's own wife is sadaqah.\" The Sahabas <br>were astonished to hear this, and submitted, \"0 Rasu-<br>lullah! (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) indulgence with <br>one's own wife is an act of satisfying one's lust, and <br>vou say this is also sadaqah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said, \"Would it not be a sin to in- <br>dulge in the unlawful?\" \"Yes\", said the Sahabas. \"In <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>the same manner, doing the lawful amounts to sada- <br>qah, and is virtuous\", explained Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). From this it is clear that to cohabit <br>with one's own wife in order to save himself from <br>adultery brings reward from Allah.\" <br>In another hadith, the reply of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) to the query by the Sahabas, (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum) that intercourse with the wife is the satisfac- <br>tion of one's lust, was \"Just tell me if a child is born as a <br>result thereof, and when he grows up to youth and be- <br>comes a centre of your expectation, he happens to die, will <br>you not hope for a reward from Allah in lieu of this loss?\" <br>Their reply was in the affirmative, and then Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) continued, \"Why this expecta- <br>tion of reward? Did you create him? Did you guide him or <br>did you sustain him? On the contrary, it was Almighty <br>Allah who created him, guided him and sustained him. <br>Similarly, you put your semen at the lawful place, then it is <br>up to Allah to make it into a child or prevent it from be- <br>coming a child.\" In short, this hadith implies that the <br>reward from Allah is for one's having become the cause of <br>the birth of the child. <br>Hadith No.8 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Whosoever hymns &iji hS;;ji<br>. . <br>L b & )  <br>33 times each, <br>and then once recites <br>after every salaat. all his sins are forgiven, even though <br>thev mav be (countless) like the foam in the sea.\" <br><br>Ch. III: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>Note: <br>That the sins are forgiven (by virtue of zikr) has <br>already been discussed under several ahadith. According to <br>the Ulamaa, it is only the minor sins that are forgiven. In <br>this hadith, it is stated that three Kalimahs should be re- <br>cited 33 times each, and then (31$!d!J> only once. Accord- <br>ing to the next hadith, two of the three Kalimahs should be <br>recited 33 times each and the third one i.e. &lj 34 times. <br>Hadhrat Zaid; (Radhiyallaho anho) is stated to have <br>narrated, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>ordered us to recite &i ii , A W'i , &I iG)thirty three times <br>each after every salaat. ~n ~ n s a i isaw in a dream that a <br>person advised reciting the three Kalimahs 25 times each <br>and then (31i! <br>also 25 times. When Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was told about this dream, he,per- <br>mitted him to recite that way. According to one hadith <br>&i <br>hi , A ui , bl b G )  should be hymned 11 times each after <br>r N <br>every &laat, a d  111 another h$d,ith it is ten times each. In <br>$ <br>one hadith, the recitation of (dlY! il!J) is ten times and that <br>of the other three Kalimahs is 33 times each. According to <br>one hadith, each of the four kalimahs should be hymned <br>hundred times each. All these ahadith are narrated in the <br>book Hisnul Haseen. The apparent difference in these ver- <br>sions is due to the different circumstances of the persons <br>who were advised by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Those who were busy with other (important) things <br>were advised the lesser number, and those who were free <br>were advised a greater number. The religious authorities, <br>however, advise that one should conform to the numbers <br>narrated in the ahadith just as the quantity of a thing that is <br>used as a medicine is also specified. <br>Hadith No.9 <br>4 . 5  *..j. i$.+ <br>hjCij<br>j & d l  dy.. i$.~J l X  plr .b i$$h ~ & jeJ j <br>jl,Jdl LG <br>SI.+!I <br>3~ +VI j~js;J&J pi, &I,&+I, +, -I 31&I <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The fol- <br>lowing words are such that one who recites them is <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>never disappointed. These are <br>&I % A .UiA! b G )  <br>which should be recited, 33, 33 and 34 times, respect- <br>ively after every obligatory salaat.\" <br>Note: <br>These Kalimahs have been termed as <br>(things<br>(.I.)*) <br>that follow), either because these are recited after the salaat <br>or because the recitation of these after sins results in <br>washing them off, or because these are recited one after the <br>other. Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated, <br>\"We have been directed to recite (At LI&, <br>33 times and (+ I;;ji) <br>33 times and& 4! ii!J,34 times aftei every salaat.\" <br>HadithNo.10 <br>is said in one hadith <br>1; <br>greater than many such mountains. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Is <br>there nobody amongst you who may be able to do, <br>everyday, good deeds equal to Uhud (a mountain near <br>Madinah).\" The Sahaba (Radhiyallaho anhum) said, <br>\"0 Rasulullah! who has the strength to do that?\" <br>\"Everybody has the strength to do it,\" said Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). \"How is it?\" enquired the <br>Sahabas (Radhiyallaho anhum). He explained, \"The <br>reward of (AIL&, <br>is greater than the mountain Uhud, <br>that of (314; ii!.j) is greater than Uhud, that of (A I;iji is <br>greater than Uhud and that of &iii) is greater than <br>Uhud.\" <br>Note: <br>It is thus stated that the reward of each of these Kali- <br>mahs is greater than the mountain of Uhud, nay. it is <br>that the reward of c!iLG) <br>and $ . W 9  fills all the Heavens <br>and the Earths. It is said in another hadith that,the reward <br><br>Ch. III: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>of ( A I ~ G )occupies half the scale-pan, the reward of <br>( A d i ,  <br>occupies the remaining half, and the reward of <br>&ail <br>fills the space between the Earth and the sky. It is <br>stated in one hadith that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) had said, \" <br>is more dear to me than all the things under the Sun.\" <br>Mullah Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) explained it to mean <br>that it is more dear than spending in the path of Allah all <br>that this world contains. It is said that once Hadhrat Sulai- <br>man (Alayhis salaam) was going somewhere on his throne, <br>when the birds spread their wings to protect him from the <br>Sun, and the armies of men and Jinn were going with him. <br>On seeing this, a worshippper praised Allah for the grand- <br>8 2  <br>eur of this vast kingdom. Hadhrat Sulaiman (Alayhis e~ <br>salaam) remarked, \"The credit in the account of deeds of a <br>i\" <br>believer for reciting ( $ L G )  once is more than the whole <br>kingdom of Sulaiman Bin Dawood, because this kingdom is <br>transitory but the reward of reciting (FJ) is everlasting.\" <br>Hadith No. 11 <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Bakhkha! Bakhkha! How weighty in the scales are <br>five things, viz. ( i t  d! d!J, , c;;ii 3), $1 b G )  , (+.W'i)and <br>exercise of patience w)by the father (or the mother) <br>over the death of his (or her) child.\" <br>The subject-matter of this hadith is narrated by many <br>Sahabas (Radhiyallaho anhum) in so many other ahadith. <br>The words (&&) (Bakhkha! Bakhkha!) are exclaimed at the <br>time of extreme joy and pleasure. These things are of great <br>joy and pleasure to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>and therefore are stressed so much by him. Is it not there- <br>fore incumbent upon us who claim to love him that we <br>should show extreme devotion to these Kalimahs, because <br>doing so also amounts to showing respect, obedience, and <br>gratitude to Him. <br>~ a d i t hNo.12 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Prophet Nooh (Alayhis salaam) said to his sons, \"I <br>give you a piece of advice and, in order that you may <br>not forget it, I say it very briefly. I advise you for doing <br>two things and forbid you from doing two things. The <br>two things which I recommend are such that Almighty <br>Allah and His noble creation are greatly pleased with <br>them. and both of these have easy access to Almighty <br>Allah. One of the two things is (j14!ii!.j,, which if it <br>were enclosed in the mighty sky, will break through it <br>and reach Almighty Allah and, if all the heavens and <br><br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>the earth were placed in one pan of the balance and <br>this kalimah were put in the other pan, the latter <br>would outweight the former. The second thing that I <br>recommend to you is the recitation of (!+j, -LS G ) ,  <br>which is the prayer of all the creation and by virtue of <br>which all the creation get their sustenance. There is <br>none among the creation that does not hymn glorifica- <br>tion of Allah, but you do not understand their speech. <br>And the two things from which I forbid you, are shirk <br>(polytheism) and arrogance, because these two keep <br>you away from Allah and His noble creation.\" <br>Note: <br>The subject matter of this hadith has also been dis- <br>cussed before when describing the virtues of$\\$ J!J,. That <br>all the creation hymn the glory of Allah is also mentioned <br>in the aayaat of the Holy Qur'an. One of these aayaat is <br>E N  <br>(There is none among the creation who does not hymn His <br>glory). <br>It is narrated in many ahadith that on the night of <br>Mi'raaj, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had heard <br>all the Heavens hymning the glory of Allah. <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) hap- <br>pened to pass by a group of men who, though halted, were <br>sitting on the backs of their horses and camels. He said to <br>them \"Do not use the backs of your animals as chairs and <br>pulpits, as so many of them are better than their riders and <br>do zikr of Allah more than the riders.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that even <br>the crops hymn the glory of Allah, and the owner gets the <br>reward for it. <br>Once a bowl of food was presented to Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), who remarked that the food was <br>hymning the glory of Allah. Somebody asked if he under- <br>stood its hymning. He replied in the affirmative, and then <br>he asked that it be taken to a certain person who also, when <br>the cup was brought to him, heard it hymning the glory of <br>Allah: In the same way, another person also heard it. Some- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>bodv requested that all those present should be allowed <br>to hear it. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"If some one fails to hear it, others will think that he is a <br>sinner.\" This sort of revelation is known as Kashf c j t s ) .  <br>which is bestowed on the Prophets, but the Sahabas (Kad- <br>hiyallaho anhum) also were able to attain it as a result of <br>their company with and their nearness to Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hundreds of incidents can be <br>cited as a proof thereof. Even the Sufis often develop this <br>quaiitv through their spiritual labour, as a result of which <br>they are able to understand what the rocks and animals <br>hymn and speak. But according to the authentic scholars, <br>proficiency in this line is not necessarily proof of one's <br>high spiritual attainment or nearness to Allah. Whoever <br>labours and strives for this can develop it, irrespective of <br>whether he attains nearness to Almighty Allah or not; <br>therefore. the true religious authorities do not attach any <br>importance to it. On the other hand, they regard it as harm- <br>ful in the respect that the novice gets so much absorbed <br>and involved into it that it acts as a hindrance to his spiri- <br>tual progress. I know this about some disciples of Maulana <br>Khalil Ahniad (Rahmatullah alaih) when they happened to <br>develop a sort of Kashf that to prevent its further progress <br>Maulana (Rahmatullah alaih), stopped them from doing all <br>sorts of zikr. FYloreover, the scholars avoid developn~ent of <br>Kashf. because it leads to the disclosure to them of the sins <br>of others, which is against their liking. <br>Allamah Sha'raani has related in his book \"Meezaanul <br>Kubra\" about Hadhrat Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) that when he happened to see somebody performing <br>ablution. he could also see the sins that were being washed <br>away in the water, so much so that he could even distin- <br>guish whether the washed off sins were major or minor <br>sins or merely undesirable deeds, just as one is able to see <br>the material things.,Clnce he happened to go into the place <br>of wudhu in the main mosque of Koofa, where a young <br>man was performing wudhu. After looking at the water <br>used by him, he quietly advised him, \"My brother! make <br>taubah from disobeying your parents,\" which he did. Then <br>he saw another person and said to him, \"My brother! re- <br>frain from adultery, it is a major sin,\" and the man made <br>taubah from adultery. He saw that the water used by yet <br>another man indicated the sins of drinking and sinful <br>amusement. He advised the man accordingly, who also <br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>made taubah then and there. Afterwards, Hadhrat Imam <br>Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah alaih) prayed, \"0 Allah! take <br>away this thing from me. I do not want to see the shortcom- <br>ings of other people.\" His prayer was accepted by Almighty <br>Allah, and he got relieved of this power. It is related that it <br>was during that earlier period that he had declared the <br>water once used for wudhu to have become polluted: when <br>he saw the dirt and bad smell of sins in it, he could not <br>regard it otherwise. After he was relieved of this power, he <br>also gave up declaring this water as polluted. <br>It is related of a disciple of our Shaikh Maulana Abdur <br>Rahim Raipuri (Rahmatullah alaih), mav Allah enlighten <br>his grave, that for days together. he could not go out to <br>answer the call of nature, because he found spiritual light <br>prevailing all over. Similarly, there are hundreds and thou- <br>sands of incidents proving beyond any doubt that those <br>who are blessed with Kashf can see hidden things, accord- <br>2 3 <br>ing to the degree of their attainment. <br>Z N  <br>Hadith No. 13 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hadhrat Umme Haani (Radhiyallaho anha) related <br>that once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) paid <br>her a visit, when she said to him, \"0Rasulullah! (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) I have grown very old and <br>weak. Tell me something that I may be able to do while <br>sitting.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said <br>to her, \"Hymn (&I 3 G )  one hundred times and you will <br>get a reward as if you set free one hundred Arab slaves; <br>hymn (?-j;;J1) <br>one hundred times, which will fetch you <br>,a reward as if you present a hu2Gred horses, fully <br>equipped, for the Jihaad; hymn @JI) <br>hundred times, <br>which is as if you sacrific~d,a,hundred camels for the <br>sake of Allah; and hymn (blYlil!9) a hundred times, the <br>reward of which will fill the whole space between the <br>earth and the sky. There is no other commendable <br>action that can surpass it.\" Hadhrat Salma (Radhiyal- <br>laho anha) the wife of Abu Raafe' (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>had also requested Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to prescribe her some zikr which may not be very <br>lengthy. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ad- <br>vised her. \"Recite &i %,ten times, because Almighty <br>Allah says in reply, \"It is for Me,\" recite(jl13G) ten <br>times. because Almighty Allah says in reply, \"It is for <br>Me\", and then recite (&4i1 ,$i) (0Allah! forgive me) ten <br>times. because then A!lah says, \"Yes, I have forgiven <br>you.\" If you recite (&+l,$i) <br>ten times, Almighty Allah <br>will also say each time, \"I have forgiven you.\" What a <br>brief and easy zikr has been proposed by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for old and weak people, <br>especially the women. It is very brief and involves <br>no labour or going about, and vet what tremendous <br>reward is promised for it. It is really a pity if we fail to <br>earn this high reward. <br>Iladhrat Umme Sulaim (Radhiyallaho anha) has narrated <br>that she also requested Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>I <br>l <br>i <br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>lam) to prescribe for her something that she should recite <br>before her supplication to Allah at the time pf*salaat, and <br>that she was told, \"Recite ( * W i F l d G )  and (7l59ten times <br>each, and then pray for what you like, Allah will say: \"Yes, <br>Yes, I accept it.\" How simple and common are these words, <br>that no effort is required to memorize them. We talk all <br>sorts of rubbish throughout the day but if, while doing our <br>business or sitting in the shop, or working on the field, we <br>hymn this zikr as well, then along with work for the earthly <br>life we can also earn a lot of wealth for the next life. <br>Hadith No. 14 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"There is a class of angels who keep going about <br>on the pathways. and wherever they find some people <br>I<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>engaged in the zikr of Allah, they call each other and <br>gather round them, and pile up over each other right <br>upto the sky. When that assembly for zikr is over. the <br>angels ascend to the Heavens and then Almighty <br>Allah. in spite of knowing everything, asks them where <br>thev had come from? They submit that they have come <br>I <br>from such and such group of His bondsmen, who were <br>busy in hymning His Glorv, His Grandeur, His Great- <br>ness and His Praise. Allah says, \"Have those people <br>seen Me?\" \"No, our Lord\", confirm the angels. \"How <br>w~ould thev have acted if they had actually seen me?\" <br>\"They would have busied themselves with even <br>greater zeal in praving to You and in hymning Your <br>praise and Glorv.\" submit the angels. \"What do they <br>demand?\" \"They want Paradise\", reply the angels. <br>\"Have they ever seen Paradise?\" says Almighty Lord. <br>i <br>\"No our Lord\" say the angels. \"If thev had seen it, how <br>\\<br>would thev have acted?\" savs Almighty Allah. \"Their <br>zeal. yearning, and their prayers for it would have been <br>even greater.\" submit the angels. \"What were they <br>seeking refuge from?\" savs Almighty Allah. \"They <br>were seeking refuge from Hell\", say the angels. \"Have <br>I<br>they seen the Hell?\" \"They have not seen it.\" \"How <br>I <br>would they have acted if they had seen it?\" says Allah. <br>\"They would have been more scared of it, and would <br>have tried more for protection against it,\" say the <br>angels. Then Almighty Allah says, \"Allright then, all <br>of you bear witness that I grant forgiveness to all those <br>present in that assembly.\" One angel says. \"0Allah! a <br>person happened to be there only by chance; he had <br>come for some other business and had not taken part <br>in what they did.\" Almighty Allah says, \"That group <br>I <br>I <br>was so blessed that whosoever happened to sit with <br>them, evell bv the way, is not deprived of the blessings <br>(and thus he is also forgiven).\" <br>It is described in several ahaadith that there is a group <br>v <br>of angels who go about in search of assemblies and individ- <br>uals engaged in zikr. and wherever they find them, they sit <br>near them and listen to their zikr. This subject matter is <br>alreadv included in Hadith No. 8 in Chapter I, wherein it is <br>I <br>also explained whv Almighty Allah praises these persons <br>I <br>in the presence of the angels. <br>The submission by an angel that there was, in that as- <br>semblv. a person who had come there on his private busi- <br><br>Ch. III: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>ness was only a statement of facts, because on that occasion <br>those angels were acting as the witnesses that those people <br>were engaged in prayers and zikr of Allah. That is why <br>they had to clarify the position, lest there should be any ob- <br>jection. But it is the extreme benevolence of Allah that, be- <br>cause of the blessed people engaged in zikr. a man who is <br>sitting near them by the way is not deprived of the bles- <br>sings. Almighty Allah savs in His Book: <br>\"0 you who believe! fear Almighty Allah and be with the <br>truthful. <br>The Sufis say. \"Remain with Almighty Allah, and if <br>'il<br>V) I.<br>this is not possible, then be in the societv of those persons <br>g<br>who remain with Almighty Allah.\" Remaining with <br>E N<br>Almighty Allah means (as given in the book of Bukhari <br>Shareef): Almighty Allah says, \"By means of non-obliga- <br>tory prayers. Mv bondman keeps on getting nearer and <br>nearer to Me, till I make him My beloved, and at that stage I <br>become his ears with which he listens, his eves with which <br>he sees, his hands with which he holds, his feet with <br>which he walks: and whatever he begs of Me I grant him.\" <br>That Allah becomes his hands and feet, etc., means that he <br>performs his actions for earning the pleasure and love of <br>Allah and that he does not do anything against the will of <br>Allah. The books of history relate the lives of many sufis <br>of this level. A booklet, known as 'Nuzhatul Basaateen' is <br>specially devoted to the account of such Sufis. <br>.Sheikh Abu Bakr Kattaani (Rahmatullah alaih) related, <br>\"Once, at the time of Hajj, there was a gathering in Mecca <br>of some Sufis, the youngest among whom was Junaid Bagh- <br>dadi (Rahmatullah alaih). In that gathering, there was a dis- <br>cussion on the subject of 'Love of Allah' and as to who is <br>the lover of Allah! Many of them expressed their views on <br>the subject, but Junaid Baghdadi (Rahmatullah alaih) kept <br>quiet. He was pressed to say something. With his head <br>bowed down and tears in his eyes, he said, \"A lover (of <br>Allah) is he who forgets his own self, remains engaged in <br>Allah's zikr with due regard to all its requirements; sees <br>Allah with the eyes of his heart, which is burnt by the heat <br>of Allah's fear; Allah's zikr intoxicates him like a cup of <br>wine, he speaks the word of Allah as if Almighty Allah <br>Virtues of Z i h  <br>speaks through his mouth; if he moves he does so under <br>the command of Allah; he derives peace of mind only <br>through obedience to Allah; and when such a stage is <br>reached, his eating, drinking, sleeping, awaking and, in <br>short, all his actions are for the pleasure of Allah; he <br>neither pays any heed to the worldly customs, nor does he <br>attach any importance to adverse criticism by the people.\" <br>Hadhrat Sa'eed bin Musayyib was a well known Ta- <br>bi'ee, and is counted as a great Muhaddith. A person <br>named Abdullah bin Abi Widaa-ah, who used to go to him <br>very often, related as follows: \"I could not go to him for a <br>few days. Then when I went, Hadhrat Sa'eed asked me <br>where I had been. I told him that my wife had died and <br>that I remained busy on that account. He said, \"Had you in- <br>formed me, I could have also joined the funeral.\" When, <br>after a little while, I got up to leave he said, 'Have you mar- <br>ried again?\" I replied, 'Who would marrv a penniless <br>person such as I am?\" He said that he would arrange it, and <br>there and then he read out the marriage serqpn and solem- <br>nised my nikaah (marriage declaration) with his own <br>daughter, fixing the mehr (jointure) at a paltry sum of eight <br>or ten annas\" (This small amount as mehr may be permiss- <br>ible according to them, as it is according to some Imams, <br>but according to Imam Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah alayh) a <br>sum less than two rupees and eight annas is not permiss- <br>ible). \"After the nikaah, I left the place. Only Almighty <br>Allah knows how overjoyed I was; in my happiness, I was <br>thinking where from to borrow the money for expenses to <br>bring the wife to my house. I remained absorbed in these <br>thoughts till it was evening. I was keeping a fast, and I <br>broke it at sunset. After the evening prayer, I reached home <br>and, lighting the lamp, I started eating my bread with olive <br>oil, when somebody knocked at the door. Who is there? <br>said I, \"Sa'eed\", came the reply. I started thinking which <br>Sa'eed it was. It did not occur to me that it could be Hadh- <br>rat Sa'eed. because for forty pears he had never been to any <br>place except the mosque and his own house. I was sur- <br>prised to see him standing outside, and submitted that he <br>should have called for me. He replied, 'It was proper for me <br>to come. I thought that since you have been married. you <br>should not be alone in your house. I have. therefore, <br>brought vour wife to live with vou. Saving this, he sent his <br>daughter in, closed the door and went away. The girl. being <br>overwhelmed with modestv, fell down on the ground. I <br>i <br>I \t<br>', \t<br>45 <br>Ch.

I told them that Hadhrat Sa'eed had <br>given his daughter to me in marriage, and that he had just <br>then himself brought her and left her in my house. 'T'hev <br>were all greatly surprised, and exclaimed, 'Is it true that <br>she is already in your house? 'Yes,' confirmed I. The news <br>spread and also reached my mother, who at once came <br>there and said, 'If you touch her for three days, I will not <br>see your face: in three days we will make all the prepara- <br>tions. After three days, when I met the girl. I found her ex-<br>tremelv beautiful. She was a Hafiz of the Qur'an. very <br>conversant with the Sunnat of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and well acquainted with her obligations <br>%<br>to her husband. For one month, neither Hadhrat Sa'eed ,, <br>came to me. nor I went to him. After one month. when I 2: <br>went to him there was a big gathering. After wishing <br>salaam to him, I sat down. When all others left, he asked <br>me how I found my wife. I replied, 'She is most excelle~lt. <br>so that friends are pleased to see her and foes become t:n-<br>vious,' He iurther said. 'If you find anything undesirable. <br>you mav use a stick to rectify it.' After I returned from <br>there, he sent me through a special messenger a gift of <br>twenty four thousand dirhams (which comes to about five<br>thousand rupees). This girl had been demanded by King <br>Abdul Malik bin Marwaan for marriage with his son, <br>Waleed, who was the crown prince. but Hadhrat Sa'eed <br>had declined the offer. In this way, he bad incurred the <br>wrath of King Abdul Malik, who on some other pretext got <br>him punished with a hundred lashes in bitter cold, J I I ~  <br>then had a pitcher of cold water poured on him.\" <br>Hadith No.15 <br>I <br>I , <br>J<br>j<br> -<br>. , 3 3,,,;i; <br>$ 2 ( t o ,  <br>. .<br>d F & d & K $ i ~ , , ~ , g , ~ ! g j ~ u<br>9 .  <br>. \t<br>. . <br>,<br>. \t<br>;vi j j a ~ ;<br>;;,e>$iL+>~j?g~i;jld& <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>45 1<br>i <br>iii & $ I \\  <br>j1<br>s &I <br>JGj WGj, Jacjy!, <br>j <br>a!, <br>&>h: <br>44 &I -. <br>>,I> <br>,!I <br>i <br>l <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever recites &i&i i!i!9 A UiAt <br>will be re-<br>warded with ten virtues for each letter thereof. Whoso- <br>ever supports an unjust party in a dispute incurs the <br>wrath of Allah, until he repents and does toubah. Who- <br>soever intercedes to prevent infliction of punishment <br>awarded according to Islamic law is considered to <br>oppose Almighty Allah, and whosoever slanders a <br>Muslim, man or woman, will in the Hereafter be im- <br>prisoned in Radghatul Khabal (a deep part of Hell), <br>until he gets exonerated from this sin, which will <br>hardly be possible there.\" <br>Backing an unjust cause has nowadays become our <br>second nature. In spite of knowing that we are at fault, we <br>become unjust and partial for the sake of our relatives and <br>our party. We are not afraid of the wrath, displeasure, and <br>punishment of Almighty Allah, when our relatives and <br>friends are involved. Not to speak of telling them that they <br>should desist from committing wrong, we cannot even <br>keep quiet and remain neutral, but we go to the extreme in <br>supporting them. If anybody P<br>uts up a claim against them, <br>we try to oppose him. If a riend of ours commits theft, <br>wrongs somebody, or indulges in adultery, we encourage <br>and help him in all possible ways. Is this according to the <br>dictates of our faith and religion? Is this accordfig to Islam <br>that we feel proud of? Do we not thus degrade our Islam in <br>the eyes of others, and degrade ourselves before Almighty <br>Allah? It is stated in one hadith that one who deals or <br>fights with somebody on the basis of sectionalism (racial- <br>ism) is not one of us. According to another hadith, section- <br>alism means to help one's own people in their wrong <br>cause. <br>\"Radghatul Khabal\" is the mud formed by the blood <br>and puss of those in Hell. How dirty and horrible would be <br>that place where such people who do slander against the <br>Muslims will be imprisoned. In this life, we take it very <br>lightly to talk against whosoever we iike, but we will re- <br>alise the gravity of our offence in the Hereafter when we <br>will be required to justify and prove whatever we have said <br>here, and the proof given there wi!l have to be acceptable <br><br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>from the Shariat point of view. Fluent talk based on lies <br>will be of no avail there. What we talk here and what the <br>actual reality is will all be known there. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"Sometimes one talks <br>merely to amuse others, but because of it he is thrown into <br>Hell to a depth which exceeds the distance between the <br>earth and the sky. A slip of the tongue is fraught with more <br>dangers than the slip of the foot.\" It is said in one hadith, <br>\"Whosoever reproaches somebody else for his sin will find <br>himself involved in it before his death.\" Imam Ahmad <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) explained that this hadith implies <br>such sins from which the sinner has done toubah. Hadhrat <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) used to pull his tongue and <br>say, \"You are the cause of our woes.\" Ibn Munkadir, a <br>famous Muhnddith, and a Taabi'ee was seen weeping when <br>he was about to die. Someone asked why he wept. He re- <br>plied, \"I do not remember to have committed any sin, but I <br>might have said something which, though ordinary in my <br>gi3 <br>opinion, may turn out to be something very serious before <br>Almighty Allah.\" <br>Hadith No 16 <br>In the closing period of his life, whenever Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) got up from a meeting, <br>he used to recite <br>\"Glory to Thee, 0 Allah, with the highest of <br>Praises; I bear witness that there is none worthy of <br>worship except Thee, 1 seek Thy forgiveness and turn <br>to Thee.\" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Someone said, \"It is only nowadays that it has <br>become customary with you to recite this prayer, but it <br>was not so before.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said, \"It is the kaffaarah (atonement) of the <br>meeting\". According to another version Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"These words <br>constitute the kaffaarah of the meeting, and were <br>taught to me by Hadhrat Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam).\" <br>Hadhrat Aa-ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) also related, <br>\"Whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) got up <br>from a meeting, he used to recite: <br>When I asked him the reason for reciting this duaa so <br>often, he said, \"If a person recites it at the end of a meeting, <br>then all his slips during the meeting are forgiven\". We are <br>all liable to do some irrelevant and useless talk during a <br>meeting. This duaa is very brief, but whosoever recites <br>either of the two versions of this duaa will get saved from <br>the adverse results of that meeting. The Almighty Lord has <br>provided so many facilities for our benefit. <br>Hadith No 17 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"When a person hymns the greatness of Allah, i.e. re- <br>cites <br>O$i<br>d\\q<br>i, <br>;\\<br>?&,<br>, , <br>-<br> u7 <br>2, && <br>< <br><br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalirnah <br>these kalimahs revolve round the Arsh with a low <br>humming tone, and mention the name of the reciter. <br>Do not you wish that there should be somebody near <br>Almighty Allah to mention and recommend you before <br>Him?\" Persons who seek an approach to the rulers, <br>and hanker after position, get overwhelmed with joy <br>and feel so proud if they are praised before a governor, <br>not to speak of the king or the minister or even the <br>viceroy, even though such a recommendation does not <br>result in any benefit to them. That no gain results is <br>clear because even if they get some lift in status, they <br>have to spend comparatively far more in getting it <br>through such recommendation. In order to approach <br>the high officials, some people squander their prop- <br>erty. get involved in debt, incur the enmity of others * <br>and thus disgrace themselves in so many ways. All this <br>is experienced during the election period. <br>ga<br>E N<br>On the other hand, just imagine the blessings and <br>honour of one's name being mentioned before the Arsh of <br>Almighty Allah, the Lord of Lords, who controls this world <br>as well as the Hereafter, and in fact everything in all the <br>universe, Who controls the hearts of the kings, Who grants <br>success or failure, gain or loss: so that, all the people of the <br>world including the rulers and the ruled, the kings and <br>their subjects, cannot harm or help anybody against His <br>will, they cannot give even a drop of water to anybody if <br>He does not will it. No worldlv wealth or honour can be <br>compared to this blessing that one's name should be men- <br>tioned with favour before such a Supreme Lord. If a person <br>attaches more importance to any worldly honour, he does a <br>great wrong to himself. <br>Hadith No.18 .., 3<br>JjLjLi JG <br>2 &&> + &, &j i>: 2 (I,+)<br>+I+@, <br>-, <br>. $&<br>fJh <br>J.~$&6%\\, yi&, <br>J$, +& .. <br>t &I<br>&+,&* <br>& j .&<br>j IX <br>~3 6 ~ 9 1  LLtj <br>i\"'4 <br>4 ,.i,<br>1_iO ,u-p 6-<br>j <br>Jli, 01 rib <br>&\\*,+I ,QI 2) ;GI <br>si;z<br>>I 2;),L 2il&jli, +,z <br>J AGY, -L L)<br>+I <br>ril j <br>U )4LyJb iul)313 y l  05, *I<br>L& &, & ;I &, i1 j& <br>9)> h ' l  c<br>b<br>l &&I <br>J >$dl &I ,pJiiU-I JG JG + j J L)<br>>Gy\\ j <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hadhrat Yaseerah (Radhiyallaho anha) one of the <br>Muhajir women, related that Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had said, \"Make it a point to hymn (w) <br>and G)k) and to sanctify Allah through reciting the <br>words u@~41<br>b ~ & )  or ejJtj iC&h +$j>$ e$) <br>and <br>counting on your fingers, because the fingers will also <br>be questioned, on the Day of Judgement, about the <br>deeds performed by them and will speak out what they <br>did. You should not neglect doing zikr of Allah, other- <br>wise you would get deprived of His Mercy. <br>Note: <br>On the Day of Judgement, the body of a person, nay, <br>his hands, feet, and every limb will be questioned about <br>the good and bad actions performed by them, as stated in <br>the Holy Qur'an at so many places. At one place, it is stated <br>The day wheh their tongues, hands and feet will stand wit- <br>ness against them about the sins they committed. <br>At another place, it is said: <br>At this place, the subject matter is decribed in several <br>aayaat, which ar,e translated as follows: <br>\"On that Day (Day of Judgement), the enemies of Allah <br>will be driven towards Hell. Then they will be checked at <br>one place, till they have all reached near the Hell. At that <br>time, their ears, eyes, skin, etc, will bear witness against <br>them, (and will tell the sins committed through these by <br>each person). At this, those people will (in utter surprise) <br>say to them, \"Why do you give witness against us?\" (it was <br>for you that, in the worldly life, we indulged in sins? These <br>organs will reply, \"Allah has given us speech, as He gave <br>speech to all the things. It is He Who created you the first <br>time, and unto Him you have returned.\" <br><br>Ch. 111:Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>There are many ahaadith that describe this sort of testi- <br>mony. In one hadith, it is stated, \"On the Day of Resurrec- <br>tion, the non-believer in spite of knowing his own sins will <br>deny that he had ever committed them. He will be told that <br>his neighbours stand witness against him. He will reply <br>that the neighbours tell lies out of enmity against him. He <br>will be told that his own kith and kin testify against him, <br>but he will say that they are also false. Then his own limbs <br>will be made to give evidence against him. According to <br>one hadith, the thigh will be the first to testify the evil <br>deeds committed by it. <br>It is stated in one hadith, \"The last one to cross the <br>Siraat Bridge will pass stumbling to this side and that side, <br>as a child does when his father gives him a beating. The <br>angels will ask him whether he would confess his sins if he <br>were helped to cmss it with ease. He will promise that he <br>&<br>will tell the real truth, and he will swear by Allah that he f~ <br>will not hide any fact. The angels will make him stand i <br>erect and pass the Siraat Bridge. When he has crossed over, <br>he will be asked by the angels to give his statement. Think- <br>ing that, if he confesses, he may be sent back to Hell, he <br>will flatly deny having committed any bad deed. The <br>angels will tell him that they can produce witnesses against <br>him. He will look around, and as there will be nobody, he <br>will think that since everybody has now reached his desti- <br>nation, no witness can be available against him, and there- <br>fore, he will agree to face witnesses. His own limbs will be <br>asked to tell the truth, and when they start speaking he will <br>be left with no alternative but to make a confession. Then <br>he will say, \"There are many serious sins that are still to be <br>told.\" Almighty Allah will then say that he has been <br>granted forgiveness. <br>It is thus a matter of necessity for us that we should <br>make our limbs do as many good acts as possible. So that <br>these may as well give witness in our favour. It is for this <br>reason that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had or- <br>dered (his followers) to count zikr on the fingers. For the <br>same reason, it is ordered in another hadith that we should <br>go to the mosque very frequently, so that the foot-prints <br>will bear witness in our favour, and reward is granted for <br>these. <br>How fortunate are the people against whom there is <br>nobody to stand witness, either because no sins are com- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>~nitted or because these were washed off through toubah, <br>etc, and who (on the other hand) have hundreds and thou-<br>sands of witnesses to testify their good deeds and virtues. <br>The easy way to become one of such people is: Firstly, if a <br>sin happens to be committed, it should be got wiped out at <br>once by means of toubah (because in this way the sin be- <br>comes extinct, as stated in Hadith No 33 of Section 11, <br>Chapter 11) and secondly, the virtues should be accumu- <br>lated in the account of deeds and there should be witnesses <br>to testify to them, the limbs used for good deeds will all <br>stand witness in one's favour. <br>Counting (of zikr) on the fingers by Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) himself is mentioned in various <br>words in several ahaadith. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Amr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) related that the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) used to hymn Allah's glory with <br>counting on his fingers. <br>111 the hadith under discussion, there is warning <br>against neglecting zikr of Allah, which deprives one of His <br>Mercy. It is thereby learnt that the people who neglect zikr <br>are ignored in respect of the Mercy of Almighty Allah. It is <br>said in the Holy Qur'an, \"You remember Me, then I will re- <br>member you (with My Mercy).\" Almighty Allah has thus <br>conditioned His granting of favours on doing His zikr. The <br>Holy Qur'an says: <br>\"And a person who intentionally closes his eyes <br>against Allah's zikr (which may be recitation of the Qur'an <br>or any other zikr), We appoint a devil on him, who remains <br>with him all the time and who (with other such devils) <br>keeps on misleading all such people (as have become blind <br>to Allah's zikr), and yet they deem they are rightly guided.\" <br>It is stated in one hadith that a devil is appointed to <br>remain with every person. In the case of a non-believer, he <br>takes part in everything he does, he is with him even when <br>he eats, drinks and sleeps. In the case of a believer he re-, <br>mains at some distance, but is always on the lookout for a <br>chance to attack him unawares when he is not doing zikr of <br>Allah. Allah says at another place in the Holy Qur'an: <br><br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>\"0,you who believe! Let not your wea!th or your chil- <br>dren (and other similar things) distract you from remem- <br>brance of Allah. Those who do so are the losers. And spend <br>of that wherewith We have provided you, before death <br>overtakes one of you and then he says, My Lord: if only <br>Thou wouldst give me respite for a little while, then I <br>would give alms and be amongst Thy good bondsmen, But <br>Almighty Allah reprieves no soul when its time has come <br>and Allah is aware of all that you do.\" <br>There are some people who do not neglect remem-<br>% <br>brance of Allah at any time. Hadhrat Shibli (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) writes, \"I happened to see a lunatic on whom some <br>E N2<br>boys were throwing stones. I reprimanded the boys, who <br>said. \"This man claims that he sees Allah.\" I went near <br>him and found that he was murmuring something. On lis- <br>tening to him attentively, I heared him saying, \"You have <br>done so well to have set these boys after me.\" I said to him, <br>\"TChese boys accuse you of something.\" \"What do they <br>say'!'\" enquired he. I said, \"They say that you claim to see <br>Allah.\" He yelled a shriek and said, \"0 Shibli, I swear by <br>Him, who has made me mad in His Love and Who keeps <br>me wandering restlessly sometimes near Him and at times <br>away from Him, if I were to lose sight of Him even for a <br>while, my heart would burst into pieces on account of the <br>pangs of separation.\" He said this, and ran away reciting <br>the following couplet: <br>Your appearance is constantly before my eyes, your re- <br>membrance is always on my tongue, your abode is in my <br>heart, then where can you hide from me. <br>When Junaid Baghdadi (Kahmatullah alaih) was about <br>to die someone advised him to recite the kalimah. He said, <br>\"I have never forgotten it any time; (you should remind it <br>to someone who may have neglected it). When Hadhrat <br>Mumshaad Dinwari (Rahmatullah alaih) was about to die <br>some one prayed to Allah for the grant of such and such <br>blessings to him in Paradise. He smiled, and said, \"For the <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>last thirty years, the Paradise with all its blessings has been <br>appearing before me, but I have not even once diverted my <br>attention from Almighty Allah towards it.\" <br>When somebody reminded Hadhrat Royam (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) at the time of his death, to recite the kalimah, he <br>said, \"I <br>have no acquaintance with anyone except <br>Almighty Allah.\" When Hadhrat Ahmad bin Khidhrwayh <br>was about to die, somebody asked him something. With <br>tears in his eyes he said, \"For the last ninety five years, I <br>have been knocking at a door which is now about to open. I <br>am not aware whether it will mean good or bad fortune for <br>me; I am too absorbed to talk to anybody at this time.\" <br>Hadith No. 19 <br>Hadhrat Juwairiah (Radhiyallaho anha) related, <br>\"When Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) left my <br>house for the morning prayer, I was sitting on the <br>prayer-mat (busy in Allah's zikr). When he came back <br>after Chaasht prayer (just before midday), I was still <br>sitting in the same position. He asked me whether I <br><br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>had continued in that position right from the time he <br>left in the morning. I replied in the affirmative. He <br>then said, \"After I left you, I recited four kalimahs <br>three times which, if compared to all that you have re- <br>cited since the morning, will be found to outweigh it. <br>These kalimahs are: <br>Glory and praise be to Allah equal in number to his <br>creation, according to His will and pleasure, equal in <br>weight to His Arsh and equal in dimensions to His <br>World).\" <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad (Radhiyallaho anho) accompanied Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to the house of a Sahabi <br>bul L <br>woman, who had before her some datestones and pebbles, <br>g 3<br>E<br>on which she was counting her zikr. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said to her, \"May I tell you something <br>which may be easier (or better) than this? <br>I glorify Allah equal to the number of His creation in <br>the Heaven, I glorify Allah equal to the number of His cre- <br>ation on the earth, and I glorify Allah equal to the number <br>of His creation in between the two (i.e. between the Heaven <br>and the Earth), and I glorify Allah equal to the number <br>of things He is to create. Likewise I hymn &hi) <br>c+*Li.i, <br>and ( j t  j!i!J) each the same total number of times.\" <br>Mulla Ali Qari has written that the zikr in the words <br>mentioned above is more rewarding because one concen- <br>trates on Allah's attributes mentioned therein, and then <br>meditates over them. It is evident that the more one medi- <br>tates and contemplates over the zikr one does, the better it <br>is. For this very reason, the recitation of even a few aayaat <br>of the Qur'an, with proper contemplation on what is read, <br>is far better than considerably more recitation done without <br>proper understanding. <br>Some Ulama consider that this zikr is superior because <br>there is in it an expression of one's utter helplessness in re- <br>spect of counting the praises and favours of Almighty <br>Allah, which is the best form of submission to Him. It is for <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>this reason that some Sufis say that we commit countless <br>sins, but we recite the name of Allah a limited number of <br>times by counting. This does not mean that we should not <br>count zikr: if it were so, then counting in particular cases <br>would not have been stressed in the ahaadith. In many of <br>the ahaadith, special rewards are promised for doing a par- <br>ticular zikr a specific number of times. It really means that <br>one should not feel contented after completing the speci- <br>fied number, and that after completing the zikr specified <br>for particular timings of the day, one should still remain <br>engaged in other various forms of zikr in one's vacant <br>periods, because zikr is such a precious wealth that it <br>should not be confined to any number or any other limita- <br>tion. <br>These ahaadith also indicate the propriety of using a <br>tasbeeh (i.e. a string of beads) for counting the zikr. Some <br>people think this to be an innovation, but this is not cor- <br>rect,! because Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw <br>others counting zikr on pebbles and date-seeds. but did not <br>object to it, which proves its justification. Stringing or not <br>stringing these together does not make any difference. <br>Therefore all scholars and jurists have been using it. Mau- <br>lana Abdul IIay wrote a book narned Nuzhatul Fikr on this <br>subject. According to Mullah Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>also the above mentioned hadith provides a complete argu- <br>ment in favour of the commonly used string of beads, be- <br>cause Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw his <br>companions counting on date-seeds and pabbles, and did <br>not disapprove it, which proves its justification, and string- <br>ing or not stringing the beads does not make any difference. <br>Therefore, the statement of the people who call this prac- <br>tice an innovation is not reliable. In the terminology of the <br>Sufis, the string of beads is called a scourge for Satan. <br>Someone, once saw a tasbeeh (rosary) in the hands of <br>Hadhrat Junaid Baghdadi (Rahmatullah alaih) at a time <br>when he was at the height of his spiritual glory, and ques- <br>tioned him about it. He replied that he could not give up a <br>thing by means of which he had attained nearness to Allah. <br>It .is narrated about many Sahabas (Radhiyallaho anhum) <br>that they kept date-seeds and pebbles for counting zikr. It is <br>related about a Sahabi named Abu Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that he used to count zikr on small pebbles or stones. <br>It is related about Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqaas (Kad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that he used (both) datestones as well as <br><br>Ch. 111: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>pebbles. Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) is also <br>reported to have used pebbles for counting zikr. It is given <br>in Mirqaat that Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>used to count on a string with knots on it. It is mentioned <br>in Sunan Abi Dawood (a book of ahaadith) that Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) used to keep a bag full <br>of date-stones and pebbles for counting zikr on these, and <br>that when the bag would get emptv, his maid-servant <br>would put these back into the bag and place it near him <br>again. The bag would get empty because the stones after <br>counting were placed outside the bag, till all the stones <br>would get finished, when the maid-servant would put the <br>same stones again into the bag and place it near him. It is <br>also narrated about Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that he had a bag containing Ajwah date-seeds, on <br>which he would commence zikr after the morning prayer <br>and would continue till all the seeds were finished from <br>gs<br>the bag. <br>E N<br>Hadhrat Abu Safiyyah (Radhiyallaho anho) a slave of <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to have a <br>piece of skin with pebbles spread on it before him, and he <br>would recite zikr on these from morning to mid-day, when <br>this skin with pebbles used to be removed from there, then <br>he would attend to his other needs. After the noon-praver, <br>the skin was again spread before him, and he would (:on- <br>tinue zikr on the pebbles till the evening. <br>The grandson of Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Kadhiyallaho <br>anho) narrated that his grandfather used to have a string <br>with two thousand knots in it, and that he would not go to <br>bed until he had completed doing zikr on these. Tht: <br>daughter of Hadhrat Imam Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rate'd about Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) that she <br>had a thread with knots, on which she used to count her <br>zikr. <br>In the termillology of the Sufis, the tasbeeh is also <br>known as muzakkirah (that which reminds), becduse when <br>it is held in one's hand there is a sort of urgt: for doing zikr. <br>and therefore it is termed as suc:h. In this c:onnec.tioll a <br>hadith is also narrated through Hadhrat Ali [liadhiyallaho <br>anho) that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaiht: wiisnllam) hncl <br>said, \"What a good muzakkirah (reminder) is the tasl~t!t:h.\" <br>In this connection, a haclith is 11arratt:tl l)y Mi~ula~ia <br>Abdul Hay (Rahmatullah alaih) \"Every Sheikh If:nc:llc?r in <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i<br>my line right upto a pupil of Hadhrat Junaid Baghdadi had <br>bestowed a tasbeeh on his pupil and recommended him to <br>do zikr on it. The pupil of Hadhrat Junaid (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) had stated 'On seeing a tasbeeh in the hand of my <br>Sheikh, I enquired if he still needed the tasbeeh after <br>having reached such a spiritual height. He replied that he <br>had seen this tasbeeh in the hand of his Sheikh, Sirri Saqati <br>(Rahmatullah alaih), and had put the same question to him, <br>and Hadhrat Sirri Saqati (Rahmatullah alaih), had also re- <br>plied that on seeing a tasbeeh in the hand of his Sheikh, <br>Hadhrat Ma'roof Karkhi (Rahmatullah alaih), he had put <br>the same question to his Sheikh Hadhrat Bishr Haafi, (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) who said that he had also put the question <br>to his Sheikh Umar Makki, (Rahmatullah alaih) who had <br>also stated that he had asked the same question from his <br>Sheikh Hadhrat Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) as to why <br>he kept a tasbeeh in his hand in spite of his having attained <br>such spritual heights, to which the Sheikh had replied, \"It <br>had proved very useful in my initial stages of Tasawwuf <br>and I had made progress by virtue of it; I do not want to <br>leave it in the last stage, when I want to use my heart, <br>tongue, hands, and everything in doing zikr of Almighty <br>Allah.\" The Muhaddith however have questioned its use. <br>Hadith No. 20 <br>- / <br>6- 2 &,& <br>@U <br>Li <br>id,SCkij <br>$, <br>ti;,% A >  &?I <br>,j,, ~ + j g  &&{,'j<br>@>{ <br>$ > 52, $ $36<br>.: . * '  <br>' <br>,&,, <br>&.I ,*GG <br>&, 31J j4 +*.

Hadhrat Ali said, \"She used to grind the corn <br>herself, as a result of which there were marks of cal- <br>luses on her hands. She herself used to fetch the water <br>in a skinbag, the string of which left an impression on <br>her chest. She swept the house herself, so that her <br>clothes remained dirty. Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) received a few slaves, both men and <br>women, and I persuaded Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>to go to her father and ask for a servant who could help <br>her in her work. She went but, on seeing a big crowd <br>with Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), she came <br>back. The next day, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) came to our house and asked her why she had <br>gone to him the previous day. She kept silent (out of <br>modesty), so I said, \"0 Rasulullah! (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) her hands have become worn out on ac-<br>count of working the grindstone, the skinbag used by <br>her for fetching water has left an impression on her <br>cl.sst, and her clothes remain dirty because of sweep- <br>ing the house herself. Therefore, I had sent her to ask <br>for a slave so that she would get some relief in her <br>work. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"0 <br>Fatimah! keep fearing Almighty Allah, discharge your <br>duties to Him, do all the work in the house yourself <br>and at the time of going to bed recite G<br>) 33 <br>times, <br>&i) <br>33 times and &i <br>34. times, be- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i <br>cause it is better for you than a servant.\" She said, \"I <br>submit to the Will of Allah and the advice of His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>According to another hadith, a similar story is related <br>by two cousins of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>who, along with his daughter, Fatimah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha), went to him, and told him of their hardships and <br>asked for a servant, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>replied to them, \"As for giving you a servant, the orphans <br>of the battle of Badr deserve preference over you; but I can <br>tell you something that is better than a servant. After every <br>Salaat, recite the three Kalimahs (i.e. tasbeeh, tahmeed and <br>- takbeer) thirty-three times each and then recite once <br>This will he more useful than a servant.\" <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recommended <br>this zikr especially to members of his household and his <br>relatives. According to one hadith, he would advise his <br>wives to recite (bl S G )  , ( A - U i )  and &i ii)33 times each at <br>the time of going to bed. ' <br>In the hadith undgr consideration, he recommended <br>this zikr to face worldly labour and hardship. The reason is <br>apparent that the worldly lahow and hardship is not a <br>matter of serious consequence for a Muslim; he is always <br>anxious to provide for the comforts and joys in the life after <br>death. It was therefore that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) diverted the attention of his dear ones from the <br>hardships and worries of this life to making provision for <br>the comforts in the Hereafter. <br>That this particular zikr is most rewarding in the Here- <br>after has been described in the hadith given in this chapter. <br>The other reason why Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) recommended these Kalimahs for zikr is that, in ad- <br>dition to spiritual and religious gains, these Kalimahs bring <br>many worldly benefits as well. There are many things in <br>the Book of Allah and in the sayings of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) which result not only in spiritual <br>gains but also in worldly benefits. Thus, it is said in one <br>hadith that during the time of Dajjaal the food of the believ- <br><br>Ch. III: Ahadith on Virtues of Third Kalimah <br>235 <br>ers will be the same as of the angels, i.e. reciting (+ILG) <br>etc., Almighty Allah will satisfy his hunger. This hadith <br>proves that in this life also one can live upon the zikr of <br>Allah, and without eating and drinking anything. When <br>such proficiency can be acquired by the common believers <br>at the time of Dajjaal, it is no wonder that the distinguished <br>ones attain this blessing even at this time. This suggests <br>that instances of some saints having lived without (or on <br>insufficient) food for days together should not be disbe- <br>lieved or refuted. <br>It is stated in one hadith that, when fire breaks out <br>anywhere <br>@%) <br>should be recited excessively, because <br>it is helpful in extinguishing the fire. It is written in the <br>book His-nu1 Haseen that if somebody feels difficulty or <br>weariness in doing some job and requires additional <br>c, <br>strength to overcome his shortcoming, he should recite <br>8 3  <br>(&I <br>33 times, <br>(Aljii) 33 times and <br>&iii) 34 <br>A<br>times, before going to-bed, or each of the three Kalimahs <br>should be recited 33 times or any one of the three may be <br>said 34 times. <br>Hafiz Ibn Taimiyah (Rahmatullah alaih) has deduced <br>from the ahaadith, in which Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) instead of giving a servant to Hadhrat Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallabo anha) advised her to recite these Kalimahs, <br>that one who does this zikr with constancy will not get <br>tired while doing laborious jobs. Hafiz Ibn Hajar has stated <br>that, even if he feels somewhat tired, it will not harm him <br>in any way. Mulla Ali Qari stated that it had been well- <br>tried that the recitation of this zikr before going to bed <br>eliminates weariness and increases the strength. <br>Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatultah alaih) has written in his <br>book Mirqaatus-Sa'ood that the fact that recitation of these <br>Kalimahs is better than a servant is true in respect of the <br>life in the Hereafter as well as in the worldly life; of course. <br>the benefits that will accrue in the Hereafter as a result of <br>this zikr cannot be compared to the meagre usefulness of a <br>servant in )his world, and also the strength acquired <br>through doing this zikr enables one to accomplish more <br>than is possible even with the help of a servant. <br>According to one hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said, \"There are two routines which if fol-<br>lowed by a Muslim will enable him to enter Paradise. Both <br>the routines are very easy, but there are very few people <br>who act according to them. One is to recite these three Ka-<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>limahs ten times each after every salaat. In this way, one <br>glorifies Allah one hundred and fifty times, and thereby <br>earns one thousand and five hundred virtues every day. <br>The second routine is to recite cLbv+) and (A+l;;ji, <br>33 times each, and & <br>34 times betore going tb bed <br>every day. In this way, one does one hundred good deeds, <br>I<br>but actually earns one thousand virtues.\" Someone asked <br>the reason why only a few people are able to act upon this? <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"At the time <br>of salaat, the devil comes and reminds him of something, <br>which actuates him to get up and go away, and at night the <br>devil reminds him of other necessities, which makes him <br>neglect to recite these Kalimahs.\" <br>In these ahaadith, there is one thing specially note- <br>worthy: that Hadhrat Fatimah (Radhiyallaho anha) who <br>would be the leader of women in Paradise, and the daugh- <br>ter of the leader of mankind in both the worlds, used to <br>grind corn flour herself (as a result of which her hands de- <br>veloped calluses on them, would herself fetch the water in <br>the skin waterbag, which left impressions on her chest and <br>would sweep the house herself, so that her clothes re-<br>mained dirty, and did all other household duties, like <br>cooking meals and preparing bread, etc. Do our womenfolk <br>perform that much labour, or even half of it, with their own <br>hands? It is certainly not so, and our lives have little resem- <br>blance with the lives of those whom we profess to be our <br>leadefs. It ought to have been that we who claim to be the <br>servants should put in more labour than our masters, but it <br>is a matter of great disappointment that the actual position <br>is quite the reverse. <br><br>EPILOGUE <br>Virtues of Salaatut Tasbeeh and Method of Performing <br>Now I will describe something that is really very <br>grand, and thereby conclude this part of the book. The Ka- <br>limahs mentioned above are very important and very <br>useful from the wordly as well as spiritual points of view, <br>as mentioned in the ahaadith given above. As these Kali- <br>mahs are very important and rewarding. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) prescribed a special prayer, which is <br>known as Salaatut Tasbeeh (i.e. salaat of these Kalimahs). It <br>is called Salaatut Tasbeeh, because these Kalimahs are re- <br>$<br>cited 300 times during this salaat. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>8 3<br>alaihe wasallam) greatly stressed this and persuaded the <br>gz<br>believers to offer this salaat, as is evident from the follow- <br>ing ahaadith: <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i<br>(1) Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to <br>his uncle, Hadhrat Abbaas, (Radhiyallaho anho). \"0, <br>Abbaas, my uncle! I want to make a special gift to you <br>i.e. to tell you something special, so that if you act <br>upon it Almighty Lord will forgive all your sins, <br>whether old or new, intentional or unintentional, <br>minor or major, open or secret. That action is to offer <br>four rakaats of nafl salaat, and during each rakaat, after <br>you have recited Surah Fatihah, and one more surah, <br>then you should say: <br>15 times, while standing still, then repeat it 10 times <br>when you are in h k u ,  10 times when you rise from the <br>ruku, 10 times in the first sajdah, 10 times when you <br>rise from the first sajdah, 10 times in the second <br>sajdah, and ten times when you sit up after the second <br>sajdah. The total in each rakaat comes to 75 times. If <br>I <br>possible, you should offer this salaat once everyday, <br>and if you cannot do it daily, then offer it on every <br>Friday, or once a month, or once a year or at least once <br>in your lifetime.\" <br>I <br>I <br>(2) A Sahdbi narrated. \"Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said to me, 'Come to me tomorrow morning, <br><br>i<br>EPILOGUE: Virtues of 'Salaat-ut-Tasbeeh' <br>I will grant you something; I will give you a special <br>gift.' I thought that I would be given some thing of ma- <br>terial value. When I went to him he said to me 'Offer <br>four rakaats of salaat after midday'. Then Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) explained the method of <br>offering this Salaat (as given in the last hadith). Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) also told me that <br>even if I were more sinful than all the other people of <br>the world, my sins would be forgiven. I asked him <br>what I should do if, for some reason, I am not able to <br>offer this salaat at the given time. He told me to offer it <br>whenever I could during day or night.\" <br>(3) \t Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had sent his <br>cousin, Hadhrat Ja'far, (Radhiyallaho anho) to Ethio- <br>pia. When he returned from there and reached Madina, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) embraced him, <br>kissed him on his forehead, and said to him, \"Shall I <br>give you something, give you good tidings, give you a <br>gift, grant you a present?\" He replied, in the affirm- <br>ative, and then Rasfillulah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>asked him to offer four rakaats in the manner ex-<br>plained already. In his hadith, the four kalimahs are <br>also followed by <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>(4) Hadhrat Abbaas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated, \"Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to me 'Should <br>I grant you a present, give you a gift, bestow something <br>on you?' I thought that he wanted to give me some ma- <br>terial thing such as had not been given to anybody <br>else.,Then he taught me the method of offering four ra- <br>kaats, as explained above. He had also told me that <br>when I sit for tahiyyaat I should repeat the kalimahs <br>before reciting at-tahiyyaatu . . . \" <br><br>EPILOGUE: Virtues of 'Salaat-ut-Tasbeeh' <br>242 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>(5) \t Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mubaarak and many other <br>scholars, while narrating the virtues of this Salaatut <br>Tasbeeh, also narrate the following method of offering, <br>this salaat. \"After reciting thanaa and before starting <br>Surah Faatihah repeat these kalimahs fifteen times. <br>Then start with (A4 i;ii) and (h+)and, after complet- <br>- , . - .<br>ing Surah Faatihah and some surah, these kalimahs <br>should be repeated ten times before the ruku, ten times <br>during the ruku, ten times after rising from the ruku, <br>ten times in each sajdah and ten times while sitting be- <br>tween the two sajdahs. This completes seventy five <br>times in one rakaat (so that the kalimahs need not be <br>recited ill the sitting position after the two sajdahs. In <br>the ruku & j <br>and in sajdah (>i\\ ;;jb G )  <br>should be recited before reciting the kalimahs.\" (This <br>method is also narrated to have been advised by Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>(1)The Salaatut Tasbeeh is a very important salaat, as <br>is evident from the ahaadith given above, wherein Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) enjoined it as a matter of <br>great kindness and favour and stressed its importance. As <br>such, the scholars, Muhaddiths, jurists, and Sufis through- <br>out the past centuries have been particular in offering this <br>salaat. Haakim (Rahmatullah alaih) who is an authority on <br>hadith, has written that the authenticity of this hadith is <br>supported by the fact that, right from the second generation <br>after the Sahabah to our times, all the great teachers of re- <br>ligion have been offering this salaat with constancy and <br>have been advising the people to do so. Abdullah bin Mu- <br>baarak is also one of them. He was the teacher of the teach- <br>ers of Imam Bukhari. Baihaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) stated <br>that, even before Ibn Mubaarak, Abul Jauza (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), an authentic Taabi'ee (one who had seen the Saha- <br>bah) and whose narrations are considered to be reliable, <br>used to be very particular in offering this salaat. Daily, as <br>soon as he heard the azaan for the noon prayer, he would <br>go to the mosque and would complete this salaat before the <br>noon salaat. Abdul Aziz bin Abi Rawwaad who was the <br>teacher of Ibn Mubaarak, and who was a great devotee, <br>saint, and pious man, stated that one who desires to go to <br>Paradise should be very constant in offering Salaatut Tas- <br>beeh. Abu Uthman Hairee (Rahmatullah alaih) who was a <br>great saint, stated that nothing is as effective as Salaatut <br><br>EPILOGUE: Virtues of 'Salaat-ut-Tasbeeh' <br>Tasbeeh in providing relief from misfortunes and sorrows. <br>Allama Taqi Subki (Rahmatullah alaih) stated, \"This salaat <br>is very important, and one should not get misled if some <br>people happen to deny its importance. One who ignores it <br>even after learning about its reward, is negligent in relig- <br>ious matters, fails to act like virtuous people, and should <br>not be considered as a reliable person.\" It is stated in Mir- <br>qaat that Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbaas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) used to offer this salaat every Friday. <br>(2) Some scholars do not accept this hadith to be au- <br>thentic, because they cannot reconcile that there could be <br>so much reward, especially forgiveness of major sins, for <br>offering only four rakaats. But since it has been narrated by <br>many Sahabas (Radhiyallaho anhum), its authenticity <br>cannot be denied. However, according to many aayaat and <br>$ <br>other ahaadith, taubah is an essential condition for the for- <br>8 $ <br>giveness of major sins. <br>:-gE;i<br>P <br>(3) In the ahaadith given above, two slightly different <br>ways of offering this salaat have been described. One is <br>that: <br>should be recited fifteen times, after recitation of Surah <br>Faatihah a?d one surah while standing, ten times after re- <br>citing (@\\ s jb G )  in the ruku, ten times after rising <br>from ruku, ten times after reciting ($Y\\ s jb G  in each <br>sajdah, ten times while sitting between the two sajdahs and <br>ten times after the second sajdah, when after saying ($ih\\) <br>one should repeat it ten times before standing in the first <br>and third rakaats and before reciting <br>in the second <br>and fourth rakaats. According to the second way of offering <br>this salaat, the kalimahs should be recited fifteen times <br>after reciting ($1 <br>UG) and before starting Surah Faati- <br>hah, ten times after reciting Surah Faatihah and a surah, <br>and the rest is like the first method, except that it is not <br>necessary to re~ite this kalimah after the second sajdah in <br>any rakaat. The scholars have stated \"It is better if this <br>salaat is offered sometimes in one way and sometimes in <br>the other way.\" As this salaat is not in general practice, a <br>few instructions are mentioned below for the facility of <br>those who offer it: <br>(1) In this salaat, no surah is particularly specified. Any <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>surah may be recited. But some scholars have stated <br>that four out of the five surahs, namely Hadeed, Hashr, <br>Saf, Jumu'ah, and Taghaabun should be recited. <br>According to some ahaadith at least twenty aayaat <br>should be recited. According to some, it should be any <br>of the surahs, Asr, Kaafiroon, Nasr, and Ikhlaas. <br>(2) \t Counting should not be done by word of mouth, as this <br>act will spoil the salaat. Counting on the fingers or by <br>I <br>. means of a string of beads is permissible but not desir- <br>able. The best way is that the fingers should be kept in <br>their position, but should be pressed one by one for <br>counting. <br>(3) If \t one forgets to recite the kalimah at any stage, he <br>should make up the number in the next act of salaat, <br>except that no such deficiency should be made up after <br>rising from ruku, between the two sajdahs or after the <br>second sajdah. In these three positions, one should <br>recite the kalimahs as specified and then make up the <br>deficiency in the next act. For instance. if one forgets <br>recitation of the kalimah in the ruku one should make <br>up this deficiency in the first sajdah. Similarly, the <br>deficiency of the first sajdah should be rnade up in the <br>second sajdah and that of second sajdah in the second <br>rakaat while standing or, if one forgets to do so, then in <br>the last rakaat while sitting and before reciting <br>(43 \t If for some reasor:, sajdatus sahw is required to be <br>done, the kalirnah is not to be recited then, because the <br>number of 300 has already been completed. If however <br>the total has been less than 300, the deficiency can be <br>made up in sajdatus sahw as well. <br>(5) \t According to some ahaadith the following duaa should <br>be recited after <br>and before the salaam: <br>EPILOGUE: Virtues of 'Salaat-ut-Tasbeeh' <br>1<br>\"0 Allah! I pray to you for granting me righteous- <br>ness (as) of those who are on the right path, actions (as) <br>of those who are true Believers. sinceritv (as) of those <br>who do taubah, constancy (as) of the contented ones, <br>b<br>precaution (as) of those who fear You, yearning (as) of <br>those who love You, devotion (as) of pious devotees, $2 <br>E N<br>and knowledge (as) of religious scholars, so that 1 may <br>fear You. 0, Allah! grant me such fear as may prevent <br>me from doing any wrong, so that, through submission <br>to You, I may do such deeds as may earn for me your <br>pleasure and your approval, and so that I map do <br>taubah with sincerity out of Your fear, and I may <br>become truely sincere out of Your love, and I may rely <br>on You, because I may always hope for better (things) <br>from You. O! The Creator of noor. You are above all <br>defects. 0 !  our Sustainer, grant us complete light <br>(noor) and forgive us; no doubt You have complete <br>control over everything. O! You, the Most Merciful, <br>grant my prayer out of Your Mercy.\" <br>(6) \t Except the three forbidden times, this salaat can be of- <br>fered at any time of the day or night.

Since ignorance of <br>law is no excuse under any government, then why should <br>it be accepted by the Lord of all rulers? They say, making <br>excuses for crime is worse than crime itself. Similarly, the <br>excuse of the scholars that no one listens to them does not <br>hold water. They boast of representing the great spiritual <br>leaders and divines of the past, but never consider how <br>many troubles and hardships they bore to preach the true <br>religion! Were they not pelted with stones? Were they not <br>abused and oppressed to the extreme degree? But in spite <br>of all these obstacles and hardships, they fulfilled their re- <br>sponsibilities about preaching, and they propagated the <br>message of Islam regardless of any opposition. <br>Generally, the Muslims have limited Tabligh to the <br>scholars only, whereas every Muslim has been commanded <br>by Allah to stop people from doing forbidden things. If we <br>admit for a moment that Tabligh is the duty of Muslim <br>scholars only who do not perform it properly, then it is the <br>particular duty of every Muslim to preach Islam. The em- <br>phasis that has been laid on Tabligh by the Qur'an and <br>Hadith, will be proved by the Qur'anic verses and sayings <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that are <br>going to be quoted in the following pages. Therefore, you <br>cannot confine Tabligh to scholars only, nor can it be an <br>excuse for you to neglect the same. I would request every <br>Muslim to devote his time and energy to Tabligh as much <br>as he can: <br>\"Consi jer, the time at your disposal. a blessing; <br>for none knows what his end will be.\" <br>You need not necessarily be a perfect scholar to preach <br>Islam and good morals to humanity. Whatever little knowl- <br>edge of Islam you possess, you must impart it to others. <br>Whenever a morally wrong or a forbidden thing is done in <br>your presence, then as a Muslim it is your duty to stop the <br>transgressor, as far as it lies in your power. I have described <br><br>all the important things about Tabligh briefly in seven <br>chapters, and I hope that every Muslim will benefit from <br>them. <br>HAFlZ MOHAMMAD ZAKARIYYA <br>SHEIKH-UL-HADITH <br>MADRASAH MAZAHIR-UL-ULUM, <br>SAHARANPUR. <br><br>CHAPTER I <br>VERSES OF THE HOLY QUR'AN CONCERNING <br>TABLIGH <br>First of all, I want to mention a few verses of the Holy <br>Qur'an concerning Tabligh. From these verses, the readers <br>can easily see how important Allah considers the preach- <br>ing of Islam. I have come across as many as sixty verses on <br>this particular subject, and Allah knows how many more <br>verses could be found by another keen observer. I quote <br>here a few of them for the benefit of every true believer. <br>\"And whose words can be better than his, who <br>calls (people) towards Allah, and performs good deeds, <br>and says: 'I am one of those who submit to Allah!'\" <br>Certain commentators have written that whoever in- <br>vites people to Allah through any means deserves the <br>honour mentioned in the above verse. For instance, the <br>prophets call people to Allah by means of miracles. and su- <br>pernatural actions, the scholars invite them by preaching <br>and arguments, the Muslim warriors [mujahids) call them <br>by means of the sword: and the muazzins cat1 them 'bv <br>means of the azaan. In short, whoever invites people to <br>good deeds deserves this reward, whether he calls them to <br>the formal observances of Islam or to the internal improve- <br>ments of the spirit, like the mystics who stress the purifica- <br>tion <br>of <br>the heart <br>and the realization <br>of <br>Allah's <br>attributes. <br>In the concluding verse quoted above some com-<br>mentators say such a person should also be proud of the <br>honour bestowed on him by Allah, of being categorised as a <br>Muslim, and he should proclaim this honour in words. <br>Some other commentators interpret that he should not <br>be proud of being a preacher, but should consider himself <br>as an ordinary Muslim. <br>. l  <br>i <br>I <br>( e o  ' <br>-,, <br>&& &pl\\yij ( Y )<br>+$\\ <br>I<br><br>Ch. I: Verses of Qumn <br>\"(0Prophet! Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) preach to <br>them (the Truth), for preaching proves very beneficial <br>for the Believers.\" <br>I <br>The commentators have written that by preaching is <br>meant instructing the believers through the verses of the <br>Holy Qur'an, for these would guide them to the Right Path. <br>But such a preaching can be useful for the disbelievers <br>also, for thereby they may become believers. Alas! in this <br>age, preaching is not performed regularly and properly. <br>Generally the object of the preachers is to show off their <br>ability and eloquence to the listeners, whereas the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"Whoever learns the art of declamation in order to <br>attract the people towards himself, his prayers and ob- <br>servances, whether obligatory or optional, will not be <br>accepted on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>8 3  <br>\"And command your family to observe the pray- f $<br>ers, and also perform these yourself regularly. We do <br>not ask you for sustenance. We will give you suste- <br>nance; and the ultimate success is for the God-fearing.\" <br>Numerous traditions say that whenever anyone com- <br>plained of poverty to the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), he recited this verse, and advised him to per- <br>form his prayers regularly, as though pointing to the fact <br>that regularity in prayers will lead to ample provision. <br>It has been stressed in this verse to do a thing yourself <br>before giving instructions to other, because this is a more <br>effective and successful method of preaching. That is why <br>all the prophets themselves first did what they preached to <br>others. Thus they became examples for their followers, <br>who would not then think that the teaching of their relig- <br>ion are so difficult to carry out. <br>Moroever. Allah has promised ample provision for <br>those who perform the prayers regularly, so that they <br>should never feel that prayers can interfere with the earn- <br>ing of their livelihood, whether through trade, service, etc. <br>Thereafter it is stated as a rule, that ultimate success and <br>salvation will be attained by the God-fearing only. <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>\"0 son! Perform thy prayers regularly; and com- <br>mand people to do good deeds, and prevent them from <br>forbidden things, and bear patiently whatever befalls <br>you (in the preaching of Truth): undoubtedly this de- <br>mands courage! \" <br>(Surah Luqmaan: 17) <br>In this verse, several important things for a Muslim <br>have been mentioned, which can be a means for our salva- <br>tion; but we have neglected these very badly. Not to speak <br>of the lack of preaching the truth, we have neglected even <br>the prayers, which is a basic principle of Islam, in fact the <br>most important after faith. There are so many people who <br>do not perform their prayers at all; but even those who do, <br>hardly perform it with all its requisites, such as congrega- <br>tional prayers. It is the poor only who perform the prayers <br>with congregation in the mosque, while the rich feel it <br>below their dignity to be present in the mosque. Ah! my <br>complaint is only to Allah! <br>\"0 careless person! What is an insult for you, is a <br>matter of pride for me.\" <br>\"0 Muslims! there must be a group among you <br>who would invite people to Good; and would com-<br>mand them to do good deeds, and would prevent them <br>from forbidden things; and these are the people who <br>will attain salvation.\" <br>(Surah Aali Imraan: 105) <br>In this verse, Allah has clearly commanded the Mus- <br>lims to prepare a group or party which would preach Islam <br>throughout the world: but we see that the so-called Mus- <br>lims have totally neglected this commandment. On the <br>other hand, the non-Muslims, are preaching their religion <br>day and night. For instance, parties of Christian mission- <br>I <br>1I <br>aries have been specially assigned to propagate their relig- <br>ion in the whole world; similarly other communities are <br>trying their best to preach their own religions. But the <br>question is, is there such an organization among the Mus- <br>lims? The answer, if not in the negative, cannot be in the <br>affirmative either. If any individual or any party among the <br>so-called Muslims arises for the preaching of Islam, un- <br>reasonable objections are raised against them, instead of <br>giving them help and co-operation, whereas it is the duty <br>of every true Muslim to help those who preach Islam, and <br>to remove shortcomings where necessary; but these people <br>neither do anything themselves to preach Islam, nor help <br>those who have devoted their lives to this sacred cause. <br>Thus the result is that even the sincere and unselfish <br>preachers are disappointed, and give up their efforts in this <br>regard. <br>\"0 Muslims! you are the best of peoples, who <br>have been selected for the guidance of mankind; you <br>enjoin them to do good deeds, and prevent them from <br>forbidden things; and you have firm faith in Allah.\" <br>(Surah Aali Imraan: 10) <br>That the Muslims are the best of all nations, has been <br>asserted in certain sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) also; and there are some verses of the <br>Holy Qur'an that corroborate this. Even the above-men- <br>tioned verse bestows the honour of 'Best Nation' on us, <br>provided we preach Islam, command people to do good <br>and prevent them from evil. <br>The commentators have written that in this verse, the <br>preaching of truth and prevention of evil has been men- <br>tioned before faith even, whereas faith (Imaan) is the root <br>of all Islamic beliefs and actions. The reason is that faith <br>has been a common factor among all the nations of the <br>world, but the special thing that has particularly distin- <br>guished the Muslims is the mandate enjoining people to do <br>good, and to prevent them from evil. So, this is the real <br>basis for the superiority of the Muslims, whenever they ful- <br>filled it; and since in Islam good actions are of little value <br>without faith, it is therefore specifically mentioned at the <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>I <br>end of the verse. In fact, the real object in this verse is to <br>emphasise the importance of enjoining people to do good <br>deeds, and this is the distinguishing feature of the Muslim <br>Ummah. It is not sufficient to enjoin good and to prevent <br>from evil only now and then, but this practice should con- <br>tinue at all times and on all occasions regularly. Reference <br>to the task of preaching the truth are found in earlier relig- <br>ions, but the distinguishing merit of the Muslim Ummah <br>lies in taking it up as a regular assignment. This is not a <br>temporary work, but a permanent one. <br>\"In the talk of an assembly of common folk there <br>is no good at all, except those who command people to <br>I <br>give charity (to the poor) or instruct them to do good <br>things, or make peace between people (they will be re- <br>warded by Allah). And whoever does this only to <br>please Allah, soon he will receive a great reward from <br>Allah.\" <br>(Surah Nisaa: 114) <br>In this verse, Allah has promised a great reward for <br>those who @each truth; and how great and honourable can <br>be the reward that has been called 'great' by Allah. <br>In this context, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>I<br>sallam) has said, \"A man's words may be a burden (sin) for <br>him, except those that he has spoken for giving instructions <br>for good deeds, and preventing others from forbidden <br>things, or for remembering Allah.\" <br>In another hadith, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said, \"Shall I tell you a virtue better than op- <br>tional prayer, fasting and charity?\" His Companions said, <br>\"You must tell us that virtue, 0 Messenger of Allah!\" (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). He said: \"To make peace between <br>people, for hate and mutual conflict uproot good deeds, <br>just as a razor removes the hair.\" <br>I<br>There are many more verses of the Holy Qur'an and <br>sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>that instruct us to make peace between people. What we <br>mean to emphasise here is that to make peace between <br>people is also another form of instructing them to do good <br>and preventing them from evil. To introduce peace and co- <br>operation in the society should therefore be given due im- <br>portance. <br><br> <br>CHAPTER 2 <br>SAYINGS OF THE HOLY PROPHET (SALLALLAHO<br>ALAIHE WASALLAM) CONCERNING TABLIGH <br>In this chapter, I will quote certain sayings of the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that explain the <br>meaning of the above-mentioned verses of the Holy Qur'an. <br>It is not the intention to encompass all the relevant ahaa- <br>dith. If I quote all the verses and the ahaadith on this sub- <br>ject, I fear no one will read them, for now-a-days people <br>hardly spare time for such things. So, to place before you <br>how important Tabligh is in the eyes of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and what serious conse-<br>quences follow from its neglect, I give below a few sayings <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>It is reported by Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: \"Whoever sees a forbidden thing being <br>done, he must prevent it by the use of his hand; and if <br>he has no power for this action, then he should pre- <br>vent it with his tongue; and if he cannot do this even, <br>then he should at least consider it a vice in his heart, <br>and this is a very low level of one's faith.\" <br>In another hadith, it has been said that if a person <br>can prevent evil with his tongue then he should so pre- <br>vent it; otherwise, he should at least think it evil in his <br>heart and thus stand exonerated. Another hadith says <br>that if anyone hates sin within his heart, he is a true <br>believer, but this is the weakest form of faith. This <br>topic has occurred in many other sayings of the <br>Prophet. Now think well how many Muslims there are <br>who act upon this hadith in a practical way. How <br>many of us prevent evil forcibly, how many with the <br>tongue, and how many seriously hate it within our <br><br>I<br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>I <br>heart? We have to take stock of ourselves on these <br>issues. <br>flI.& SI~I;&I +j&9 &I & J6 &; ~ & J I9 (y) <br>I<br>+dl L a  &,0 > *  <br>e * ,<br>J! <br>w, b$i <br>e<br>+<br> <br>jG * & <br>J. <br>a 9 2<br>,& ,#i <br>* .  . @,, <br>0: 3 & <br>&j\\ $ <br>I;\\ , , <br>.-<br>(+b$Ij 6,WI <br>0Ij,) <br>19,1sGJji 3 ljkl <br>It has been reported by Nu'maan bin Basheer <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: \"There are people who do not <br>transgress the limits (laws) of Allah, and there are <br>others who do so. They are like two groups who <br>boarded a ship; one of them settled on the upper deck. <br>and the other, on the lower deck of the ship. So, when <br>the people of the lower deck needed water, they said: <br>'Why should we cause trouble to the people of the <br>upper deck when we can easily have plenty of water <br>by making a hole in our deck.' Now if the people of the <br>upper deck do not prevent this group from such fool- <br>ishness, all of them will perish - but if they stop them <br>then they all will be saved.\" <br>(Bukhari& Tirmizi) <br>Once the Companions of the Ffoly Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasal!am) asked him: \"0 Messenger of Allah! (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasgllam) can we people be destroyed even <br>when there are certain pious God-fearing persons among <br>us?\" He answered: \"Yes, when evil deeds predominate in a <br>society.\" <br>Nowadays the Muslims are generally anxious about the <br>decline and fall of this Ummah, and they suggest certain <br>plans to stop this decline, but they ]:ever consider as to <br>what is the main cause of our decline. They fail to identify <br>the true reason of our spiritual and rcoral decline. particu- <br>larly when the proper remedy has been told by Allah and <br>:he Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). It is a pity <br>that because of the wrong diagnos~s, incorrect remedies, in- <br>cluding continued neglect of Tabligh, are leading to the fur- <br>ther decline of the Ummah. In fact, the main cause of our <br>decline is that rye do not pay attention to Tabligh nor do <br>we help those who devote themselves to this sacred mis- <br>sion. <br>Ch. 11: Sayings of the Prophet <br>2 2 *Alpj~<br>j3 <br>*<br>D J>, JG Jd ?+ <br>. ~ (y)<br>i\\. <br>+ pb<br>ti;jll J!

So, when <br>this state of affairs began to prevail, Allah caused their <br>hearts to be accursed in the same manner.\" (i.e. the <br>hearts were also affected with the disobedience of the <br>transgressors). Then in support of this, the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited a verse of <br>the Holy Qur'an, which says: 'The disobedient and the <br>transgressors among the Bani Israa-eel were accursed <br>by Allah.' On this, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) emphatically instructed his Companions: <br>\"(To avoid such decline) you people must enjoin upon <br>others to do good deeds and prevent them from doing <br>forbidden things: you should restrain every tyrant from <br>tyranny and invite him towards truth and justice.\" <br>Another hadith says that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was reclining comfortably when, sud- <br>denly overcome with emotion, he sat up and said: \"I swear <br>by Allah that you people cannot attain salvation, unless <br>you prevent the tyrants from tyranny.\" <br>Another hadith says that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said: \"You people must preach truth, and <br>prevent the sinners from doing forbidden things, and check <br>the tyrants, to bring them towards the right path, otherwise <br>you will be accursed and your hearts will be corrupted, just <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>as Allah did with Bani Israa-eel.\" The Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) read certain relevant verses of the <br>Holy Qur'an to emphasize this subject. Bani Israa-eel were <br>condemned because among other things, they did not pre- <br>vent others from doing forbidden things. <br>Nowadays it is considered a virtue to be at peace with <br>all, and to please everyone on every occasion. They say it is <br>a requirement of good manners with the evildoers. <br>Obviously, this is a wrong policy, because at most <br>there may be some religious sanction for keeping quiet in <br>extreme case, but never for falling in line with the tyrants <br>and transgressors. At the very least, every one must instruct <br>those people to do good whom he easily can influence for <br>instance: his subordinates, his servants, his wife, his chil- <br>dren, and his relations. In such circumstances, to be abso- <br>lutely silent about Tabligh is unpardonable before Allah. <br>Hadhrat Sufyaan Thowri says: \"Whoever is very popu- <br>lar with his relations and neighbours, we suspect him to be <br>cotnpromising in preaching the true teachings of religion.\" <br>Numerous traditions say that when a sin is committed <br>secretly, its harm is generally limited to the sinner only; <br>but when a sin is committed openly, and those possessing <br>the capability do not prevent it, then it ultimately affects <br>all the people around. <br>Now everyone can see for himself, how many sins are <br>committed before him every day, and he, in spite of having <br>the power to prevent them neglects to do so. And it is a <br>pity that, if anyone gets up to put the wrong down, the ig- <br>norant and shameless people oppose him instead of co-op- <br>erating with him. <br>Those who do wrong will come to know by what a <br>great reverse they will be overturned. <br>- * a *  <br>.

Not to speak of strangers, we generally do not <br>prevent even our own family and our subordinates from <br>wrong-doing. We do not even make up our minds to pre- <br>vent evil, much less doing something practical about it. <br>Whatever our own son does against the Commandments of <br>Allah, we do not check him even; but if he takes some in- <br>terest in politics, or mixes up in a certain political party, <br>we are seriously anxious not only about him, but about our <br>own safety and honour. Then we warn him and also think <br>about some plans to be safe and secure from any harm; but <br>on the other hand, when he transgresses against Allah's <br>Commandments, we are never anxious about the life in the <br>Hereafter, and about the Reckoning of the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Sometimes you know full well that your son is ad- <br>:5 <br>dicted to some idle pursuits and is very lax in his prayers, <br>9 2<br>but you have no courage to prevent him from such habits. <br>.k+ p<br>or to chastise him, although Allah has clearly commanded <br>you to be severe in uprooting such evils and even sever re- <br>lations with the transgressor. There is many a father who <br>would be angry with his son, because he is lazy and does <br>not attend to his studies or services or business properly, <br>but is there anyone who is angry with his son, because he <br>does not perform the fundamental observances of Islam? <br>As a matter of fact, the adverse effect of this negligence <br>is not limited to the great loss in the Hereafter but it is a <br>pity this evidently extends to our worldly affairs and inter- <br>ests also, which are so dear to us. This blindness of ours is <br>horrible, for Allah says: <br>\"Whoever is blind in this world, he will be surely <br>blind in the Hereafter.\" <br>And such transgressors have taken leave of their senses <br>because <br>.*! j <br>A <br>&k~ , ~ 4 , ~ , w + j ~ ; > , ~ & , & ~<br>( V  ' i+\") <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>\"Allah has sealed up their hearts, and on their ears and <br>eyes there are veils (so they neither hear nor see the <br>truth).\" <br>It has been reported by Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said: \"So long as a person says \"La ilaaha <br>illallaah\" (no one is worthy of worship but Allah), he <br>receives spiritual benefits, and is saved from miseries <br>and calamities, unless he neglects its rights.\" His Com- <br>panions said: \"0 Messenger of Allah (Sallaho alaihe <br>wasallam)! how are its rights neglected?\" He answered: <br>\"When sins are committed openly, and the person who <br>recites the kalimah does not prevent the sinners from <br>wrongdoings.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>Now you can yourself cohsider how very often sins are <br>committed during these times, yet there is no serious at- <br>tempt to check or prevent them. In such a dangerous and <br>ungodly atmosphere, the very existence of the Muslims in <br>the world is a great blessing of Allah, otherwise we are in- <br>viting ruination through all possible means. Hadhrat Aa- <br>ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) asked the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), \"When the punishment of Allah be- <br>falls the inhabitants of any locality, does it affect the pious, <br>just as it affects the guilty?\" The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) answered: \"Yes, it does affect all of them <br>in this world, but at the Resurrection the pious will be sep- <br>arated from the guilty.\" Therefore, those people who are <br>simply satisfied with their own piety, and do not partici- <br>pate in improving others should not rest assured that they <br>are safe from the punishment of the Almighty. If any chas- <br>tisement is inflicted by Allah, they too will be involved in <br>it. <br>i <br>I <br>I' <br>'<br>Hadhrat Aa-ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says: \"Once the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) entered the <br>house and I guessed from his face that something of great <br>importance had happened to him. He did not talk to <br>anyone, and after making wudhu (ablution) he entered the <br>mosque. I stood behind the wall to hear what he said. He <br>sat at the pulpit and after praising'Allah, he said, \"0Mus-<br>lims! Allah has commanded you to call people to good <br>deeds, and prevent them from committing sins; otherwise a <br>time will come when you will pray to Him, but He will not <br>listen to you; you will ask your needs of Him, but He will <br>not grant them; you will demand His help against your ene- <br>mies, but He will not help you.\" After saying this, he came <br>2,<br>'a Ol<br>down from the pulpit.\" <br>Particularly those persons should consider this hadith <br>.=g<br>well whq want to fight the enemies of Islam, but neglect <br>the performance of the requisites of Islam; they forget that <br>the strength and stability of the Muslim Nation depends <br>upon the propagation of Islam. Hadhrat Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who is a distinguished Companion of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: \"You must <br>command people to do good, and restrain them from evil; <br>otherwise Allah will cause such a tyrant to rule over you, <br>who will not respect your elders, and will not have mercy <br>on your youngsters. Then you people will pray to Him, but <br>He will not accept your prayer; you will ask Him for help, <br>but He will not help you, you will seek His pardon but He <br>will not pardon you; for Allah Himself says: <br>\"0Believers! if you help Allah, then will He help <br>you, and will make your feet firm (against your ene- <br>mies).\" <br>Says Allah in another verse: <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>I<br>I <br>\"0 Believers! If Allah helps you, then no one can <br>overpower you; and if He does not help you, then who <br>can come to your help? and only in Allah should the <br>Believers trust.\" <br>It has been reported by Hadhrat Huzaifah (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said on oath: <br>\"You must command people to do good deeds, <br>and prevent them from doing forbidden things; other- <br>wise Allah will inflict a severe punishment upon you, <br>and then even your prayers will not be accepted by <br>Him.\" <br>Here my respected readers should consider well how <br>many times they violate the commandments of Allah; then <br>they will know why their attempts to reform the nation fail, <br>and why their prayers are of no avail, and they instead of <br>sowing the seeds of progress, cause its decline. <br>It has been reported by Abu Hurairah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) said, \"When my followers will begin to adore <br>the worldly benefits, their hearts will be deprived of <br>the dignity and love of Islam; and when they stop the <br>preaching of truth, and preventing transgression, they <br>will be deprived of the blessings of the Revelation; and <br>when they will abuse each other, they will fall from <br>the esteem of Allah.\" <br>(Tirmazi) <br>The well-wishers of the nation should ponder why <br>their efforts result in failure instead of success. If vou <br><br>Ch. 11: Sayings of the Prophet <br>2 1<br>people believe your Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>I <br>and his teachings to be true and educative, then why do <br>you take those things as useful that are declared harmful by <br>him. He says such and such thing will aggravate your dis- <br>ease, but you think they will bring health to you. The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"None of you can be a true Muslim, unless his de- <br>sires are subject to the religion that I have brought.\" <br>But contrary to this, you think that religion is an obstacle <br>in the way of your individual and national progress on the <br>lines of other nations. Says Allah in the Holy Qur'an: <br>\"Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We <br>ant increase in his harvest; and whoever desires the <br>Exvest of this world we give him the fruit thereof but <br>there is no portion for him in the Hereafter.\" <br>3 s  <br>A hadith of this meaning says: <br>.-I{F<br>P -<br>\"The heart of a Muslim whose object is the life Here- <br>after does not care for the worldly pleasures, yet the <br>world is brought to his feet; on the other hand, who- <br>ever goes after the world, he is overpowered by mise- <br>ries and calamities, yet he cannot receive more than <br>his allotted portion.\" <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) read the <br>above-mentioned verse, and said: Allah says: \"0 son of <br>man! devote yourself to My worship, and I will free your <br>bosom from the worldly anxieties and will remove your <br>poverty, otherwise I will fill your heart with a thousand <br>I <br>worries and will not remove your poverty.\" <br>These are the words of Allah and the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), but you foolishly think that <br>religion and the teachings of Mullahs (religious divines) are <br>a hindrance in the path of your (worldly) progress. Don't <br>you think that your worldly progress can be very helpful to <br>the Mullahs, for then you would be in a better position to <br>serve them. Then why should they oppose you, to their <br>own loss? As a matter of fact, they are sacrificing their own <br>worldly interests by speaking the truth, by preaching Islam. <br><br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>in order to bring you to the Right Path. When whatever <br>your religion scholars tell you is in fact based on the teach- <br>ings of the Holy Qur'an, then is it sensible for you to turn <br>away from them? And if you deny them, then can you be a <br>true believer? Your religious preachers might have some <br>personal faults but, so long as they are conveying to you <br>the commandments of Allah from the Holy Qur'an and the <br>sayings of the Holy Prophet, (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>you are bound to listen to them and to obey their instruc- <br>tions; and if you don't obey them, you have yourself to <br>answer for your disobedience to Allah. Not even a fool <br>would say that the official orders should not be obeyed, <br>simply because they were communicated by a lowly ser- <br>vant. <br>Never make such a sweeping statement that those who <br>have devoted themselves to the sacred cause of Islam <br>hanker after worldly gains and interest. True preachers of <br>Islam are never selfish, and never ask anything for them- <br>selves; the more they worship Allah, (and devote them- <br>selves to the work of religion) the less attention they pay to <br>worldly offerings. Nevertheless, if they ask help of you, it <br>will be entirely for the sake of religion (to preach Islam and <br>the Holy Qur'an); and therein they find more satisfaction <br>than in any personal cause. Then why should you hestitate <br>to help them? <br>A question is generally raised stating that Islam does <br>not prescribe giving up of worldly interests and in this con- <br>nection the verses of the Holy Qur'an are often misunder- <br>stood, for instance, there is a verse that says: <br>\"Our Lord! grant us good in this world, and good in <br>the Hereafter; and save us from the chastisement of the <br>Fire (of Hell).\" <br>(Al-Baqarah:210) <br>Some ignorant people stress that in this verse the <br>worldly good is favoured and appreciated by Islam, as <br>much as the good in the Hereafter. In other words, there is <br>no renunciation of the world in Islam. Such people claim <br>to be perfect scholars after having seen only some transla- <br>tions of the Holy Qur'an. The true meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an can be properly understood by those only who have <br>looked deep into its verses and are well-informed on this <br>subject. Different interpretations of the above-mentioned <br><br>Ch. 11: Sayings of the Prophet <br>verse that have been explained by the Companions of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and the scholars <br>of Islam are as follows: <br>Hadhrat Qatadah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"By 'good <br>in this world' is meant peaceful existence and necess- <br>ary livelihood\". <br>Hadhrat Ali (Karramallahu wajhahu) says that by 'good <br>in this world' is meant a pious wife. <br>Hadhrat Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) says that by <br>'good in this world' is meant knowledge of Islam and <br>prayer'. <br>Hadhrat Suddi (Rahmatullah alaih) says that by <br>'good in this world' is meant lawful earnings. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that <br>by 'good in this world' is meant righteous children and <br>goodwill of other human beings. <br>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) says that by <br>%= <br>\"good in this world\" is meant good health, honest <br>g s  <br>living, knowledge of the Holy Qur'an, victory over the <br>enemies of Islam, and the company of the pious.\" <br>f <br>I would add that if \"good in this world\" meant our ma- <br>terial progress, even then the emphasis in the verse is on <br>praying to Allah for such a \"good\" but not on completely <br>busying ourself in this pursuit. Asking from Allah, even if <br>it be the mending of a shoe is in itself a part of religion. Ue- <br>sides, if it means honest living, or to be prosperous and <br>self-sufficient, that too is not forbidden in Islam; by all <br>means make your living in this world consistent with relig- <br>ion. The point is that our endeavours in the cause of relig- <br>ion should at least be as much as those for worldly gains, if <br>not more, because Islam teaches us to value both this lift: <br>and the Hereafter. <br>Please consider also the following verses of the Holv <br>Qur'an, which lay more stress and importance on the lift: <br>Hereafter: <br>\"Whoever desires the harvest of the life Hereafter. <br>We will certainly increase his harvest. <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>Whoever desires this present world (and its ben- <br>efits), We shall soon grant him whatever he desires: <br>then We will make Hell his destination, wherein he <br>will be thrown headlong, with disgrace. And whoever <br>desires the Hereafter, and makes an effort to attain it. <br>and he is a true believer-those are the people whose <br>efforts will be rewarded.\" <br>(Bani Isra-eel: 18-19) <br>\"And amongst you are those who desire this world <br>only; and amongst you are those who desire the life <br>Hereafter.\" <br>(Aali Imraan: 152) <br>\"These are the benefits of the life of this world: <br>but with Allah is a very good abode.\" <br>(Aali Imraan: 14) <br>\"(0Prophet! Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) say: <br>\"The benefit of this world is very little; but the life <br>Hereafter is much better for those who fear Allah.\" <br>(An-Nisaa: 77) <br>\"The life of this world is nothing but a game and <br>sport, and the House of the Hereafter is much better for <br>the pious.\" <br>(Al-An'aam:32) <br>I<br>Ch. 11: Sayings of the Prophet <br>\"And leave aside those who have made a jest of <br>their religion, and they have become puffed up with <br>this worldly life.\" (Al-An'aam: 70) <br>\"You people desire the benefits of this present world <br>only, but Allah desires the Hereafter (for you).\" <br>(Al-Anfaal-67) <br>Are you pleased with the worldly life instead of the <br>Hereafter? But the benefits of the life of this world are <br>as nothing, when compared to the Hereafter.\" <br>(At-Towbah-38) <br>\"Whoever desires the life of this world, and all its <br>adornments, we make their attempts therein fruitful, <br>and nothing is decreased' from their due. For them <br>there is nothing but Fire in the Hereafter, whatever <br>they performed (of some good deeds) in the world has <br>been destroyed, for whatever they did was absolutely <br>false.\" <br>(Hud- 16) <br>\"And they have become pleased with the worldly life <br>only; but the worldly life, when compared to the Here- <br>after, is but a small benefit.\" <br>(Ar-Ra'd-26) <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>\"On them fell the wrath of Allah, and for them is a <br>great chastisement. It is because they preferred the life <br>I<br>of this world to the Hereafter.\" <br>I <br>(An-Nahl-107) <br>There are many other verses in which the life of this <br>world and the Hereafter have been compared. I cannot <br>mention all of them, but I have quoted a few of them as ex- <br>amples. Basically, the moral of all the verses is that those <br>who prefer this world to the Hereafter will be losers in the <br>long run. If you cannot properly deal with both the worlds, <br>then the life Hereafter is preferable, and you should fulfil <br>its requirements. I admit that this world and the requisites <br>of the life here are unavoidable needs, yet note that no sen- <br>sible person would keep sitting in the toilet, even though <br>one is compelled to visit the toilet. <br>If we carefully study the Shariat, we will have to admit <br>that it has prescribed a proper place for our worldly activi- <br>ties and religious duties. We have been commanded to <br>devote one half of our time to the prayers, and we may <br>spend the rest of our time in our worldly pursuits, whether <br>we devote it to rest or to earning our living. According to <br>this plan, we can maintain a balance between the two, and <br>can carry out our duties about our religion as well as about <br>our worldly 'life. So, if we devote ourselves wholly or <br>mainly to the worldly requirements, then we are unjust and <br>negligent. The sense of justice requires that we should be <br>faithful to both, that is, to the requisites of life as well as to <br>the hereafter, so that both are catered for because Islam <br>does not advocate withdrawal from this world. This is <br>what is meant by the verse: <br>\"0 Lord! give us good in this world and in the Here- <br>after, and save us from the Fire (of Hell).\" <br>(Al-Baqarah: 201) <br>In this chapter, my real object was to quote the sayings <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) about the <br>Tabligh work. And the seven that I have quoted above are <br>sufficient for true believers; as for the disbelievers. Allah <br>says: <br><br>Ch. 11: Sayings of the Prophet <br>2 7 <br>\"Those who do wrong will come to know by what a <br>(great) reverse they will be overturned.\" <br>Some sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) indicate that there will come a time when every- <br>one will follow his own wishes and temptations, and no <br>one will pay heed to the teachings of religion or to the com- <br>mandments of Allah. In those times, the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) has advised us to mind our own <br>business and to worship Allah, rather than deliver sermons <br>to the people. But the divines of the nation say that such a <br>period has not yet come; therefore, try your best to reform <br>yourself and to instruct others, before such a time comes. <br>We must avoid those shortcomings pointed out by the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) above as these are the <br>doors through which will occur corruption in our personal <br>life as well as in the society. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has counted these shortcomings among the <br>causes of our destruction. <br>* <br>*I$, <br>* <br>I <br>3. <br>\"0 Allah! save us from the trials of evil, whether it be ex- <br>ternal or internal.\" <br><br>CHAPTER 3 <br>I <br>PRACTISE WHAT YOU PREACH <br>I <br>In this chapter it is intended to draw attention to a sig- <br>nificant shortcoming. Just as most educated Muslims and <br>scholars of the day have neglected the duty of Tabligh <br>work, similarly there are those who preach Islam to others <br>through speech and by writings, but they neglect practising <br>what they say. In fact they, as preachers, should attend to <br>reforming themselves more than to reform others. The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has strictly forbidden <br>such persons to preach who are themselves guilty of trans- <br>I<br>gression. <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on the <br>night of Mi'raaj (ascension) saw a group of persons whose <br>I <br>lips were being clipped with fiery scissors. On asking who <br>they were, Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) told him that these <br>I <br>persons were preachers from among your followers who <br>did not act on what they preached. A hadith says: \"Some of <br>the residents of Paradise will ask those in Hell: \"How are <br>you people here, whereas we followed your preachings, <br>and thereby we got into Paradise?\" They will answer: \"We <br>did not practise ourselves what we preached to others.\" <br>Another hadith says: \"The punishment of Allah will <br>descend more speedily upon the wicked scholars than on <br>the common sinners. They will be astonished to see this, <br>and will say: \"Why is the punishment of Allah inflicted on <br>us before the idolaters even?\" They will be answered thus: <br>\"Those who transgressed in spite of having knowledge of <br>religion are more guilty than those who had not this knowl- <br>edge.\" The Muslim divines have written that the sermons <br>of those who do not practise the religious observances <br>themselves, cannot leave an impression on others. That is <br>why the religious speeches, writings and the journals in <br>this age fall flat on the listeners and the readers! <br>I <br>Says Allah in the Holy Qur'an: <br>I <br>Ch. 111: Practise what you Preach <br>\"Do you command people to do good, but forget <br>your own souls, although you read the Book? Do nor <br>you understand?\" <br>The Holy Prophet says: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, no one will be per-<br>mitted to move away a single step until he is put these <br>four questions: (1)How did you spend your period of <br>life? (2) What use did you make of your youth? (3) <br>How did you earn your wealth, and where did you <br>spend it? (4) How far did you act upon your knowl- <br>edge?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) is a distin-<br>guished Comparlion of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). He says: \"The thing I fear most is the question <br>that will be put to me on the Day of Judgement in the pres- <br>ence of all the people: Did you act upon the knowledge that <br>you possessed?\" <br>A certain Companion of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) asked him: \"Who is the worst of all crea- <br>tures?\" He answered: \"Don't ask me a question about bad <br>things, but ask me a question about good things. The worst <br>of all creatures are the wicked scholars. (i.e. those who do <br>not practise what they say).\" <br>Says the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in <br>another hadith: \"Knowledge is of two kinds: one, which re- <br>mains on the tongue only and does not affect the heart and <br>so is in fact an accusation from Allah; and the other which <br>penetrates into the heart and revives the spirit: that is <br>indeed useful.\" What we mean to say is that a Muslim <br>should not acquire only that knowledge which concerns <br>the formal observances, but also the spiritual knowledge <br>which would purify his heart and enlighten his brain; <br>otherwise it would be a cause for questioning on the Day of <br>judgement as to how far it was acted upon. Similar warn- <br>ings are contained in several other ahaadith. <br>Therefore I would solemnly request all the mission- <br>aries and preachers to reform themselves outwardly and in- <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>wardly, and to practise themselves what they preach to <br>others, otherwisemere preachment without practice cannot <br>be accepted by Allah, as has been shown by various verses <br>of the Holy Qur'an. as well as sayings of the Holy Prophet. I <br>pray to Allah that He should enable me also to improve <br>myself externally and internally and practise what I <br>preach, for I entirely depend upon His favours to hide my <br>deficiencies. <br>I<br>CHAPTER 4 <br> <br>THE IMPORTANCE OF IKRAAM IN TABLIGH <br>This chapter concerns another very important require- <br>ment for Tabligh, which through a little carelessness of the <br>preachers, can do harm instead of good. For instance, when <br>trying to prevent someone from wrongdoing, or save him <br>from a bad habit, you should advise him privately and not <br>openly disgrace him in the eyes of others; a Muslim's dig- <br>nity is a valuable asset; as explained in the following say- <br>ings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>It has been reported by Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho <br>+ <br>anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- gs<br>lam) said: \"Whoever conceals the sins of a Muslim, <br>\"Zj <br>Allah will conceal his sins in this world and in the <br>g g<br>Hereafter: and Allah helps His servant so long as he <br>helps his brother Muslim.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>It has been reported by Ibn Abbaas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: \"Whoever conceals the wrong-doings of a <br>brother Muslim. Allah will conceal his wrong-doings <br>on the Day of Judgement, and whoever will publicise <br>the wrong-doings of a brother Muslim, Allah will dis- <br>close his wong-doings to the people, so much so that <br>he will be disgraced sitting in his own house.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>Similarly, there are many other traditions on this sub- <br>ject, therefore, the preachers of Islam should always have a <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>great regard for conniving at faults and maintaining the dig- <br>nity of brethren in Islam. Another hadith says: \"Whoever <br>does not help his brother Muslim, when he is being dis- <br>honoured, Allah will not pay heed to him when he himself <br>is badly in need of help.\" Still another hadith says: \"The <br>worst form of usury is dishonouring a Muslim.\" <br>In numerous traditions like this, the dishonouring of a <br>Muslim has been strictly forbidden; therefore, the mission- <br>aries should be particularly cautious on this subject. The <br>correct method is to advise people secretly on the sins that <br>come to knowledge secretly: and take corrective measures <br>openly on the sins that are committed openly. Even the <br>advice should be given in such a manner that the transgres- <br>sor is not dishonoured, lest the advice produces the oppo- <br>site effect. In short, the transgressors must be checked <br>strictly, according to the commandments of Allah, but let <br>us not forget the instructions given above to respect the <br>dignity of every Muslim. <br>Moreover, a preacher must be polite and courteous <br>when he addresses his audience: for ill temper and bitter <br>words have just the opposite effect. A preacher spoke <br>harshly to the Caliph Ma'moon ar-Rasheed. He said: <br>\"Please be polite and courteous to me, for Fir'own was a <br>worse fellow than me, and Moosa (Alayhis salaam) was a <br>much better person than you, but when he and Haroon <br>(Alayhis salaam) were sent to instruct Fir'own, Allah said: <br>\"Speak to him in soft words, that he may turn to the <br>Right Path, or perchance he may fear Me!\" <br>(Taahaa-44) <br>A youth (from the outlying regions) came to the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and said: \"Please <br>permit me to commit adultery.\" The Companions of the <br>Holy Prcphet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) took this very <br>ill, and were enraged at his words; but the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to him: \"Come nearer to <br>me. Would you like anyone to commit adultery with your <br>mother?\" He said: \"Not at all.\" The Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Then other people will also <br>never tolerate such a shameful act with their mothers.\" <br>Then the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>him the same question about his sister. aunt etc., and he <br><br>answered each time in the negative. Then the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam] put his hand on his chest and <br>prayed: \"0 Allah! purify his heart, forgive his sins, and <br>guard him against adultery.\" The reporters say that, after <br>this, nothing was more hateful to him than adultery. <br>To be brief, .the preachers should always be kind, <br>polite and sympathetic towards their listeners, and should <br>treat them as they would themselves like to be treated. <br><br>I <br>CHAPTER 5 <br>IMPORTANCE OF IKHLAAS (SINCERITY) IN TABLIGH <br>I would particularly request the missionaries to base <br>all their speeches, writings and actions on sincerity. Even a <br>small good deed based on sincerity will be greatly re-<br>warded by AlIah, whereas without sincerity it will fetch no <br>reward in this world or in the Hereafter. <br>Says the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in this context: \"Allah does not look towards your <br>faces, or towards your riches; but He sees (the sincerity <br>of) your hearts, and the nature of your deeds.\" <br>(Mishkaat) <br>On another occasion; the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) was asked as to what is the meaning <br>of 'Eemaan'. He answered: \"It means sincerity.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyallaho anho) was given com- <br>mand in Yemen. When he was about to depart. he asked for <br>advice from the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>who said: \"Observe sincerity in all your religious beliefs <br>and actions. for it will increase the reward of your good <br>deeds.\" Another hadith says: \"Allah accepts only those <br>deeds of His servants, which are based on complete sincer- <br>ity to Him.\" <br>Another hadith says: \"Allah has proclaimed: 'I am <br>the most self-respecting and self-sufficient of all partners; <br>therefore whoever brings forth a partner to Me in any <br><br>action, I entrust him to the same partner, (and do not <br>help him at all). Then I have no value for his actions, <br>which are all given to the partner.'\" <br>It has been stated in another hadith that it will be pro- <br>claimed on the Day of Judgement: \"Whoever has brought <br>forward a partner to Allah in any action, he should demand <br>his reward from the same partner; for Allah is far above <br>needing any partner.\" <br>Another hadith says: <br>\"Whoever performs prayer for show, he becomes <br>guilty of false worship; and whoever observes fasts for <br>show, he also becomes guilty of false worship; and <br>whoever gives alms for show, he also becomes guilty of <br>false worship.\" <br>(..1 <br>(Mishkaat) <br>P S6 <br>z a  <br>To be guilty of false worship here means that he does <br>.= g <br>not perform such good deeds sincerely to please Allah <br>only, but by making a show of them he wants to win the <br>favour and appreciation of human beings, which is to set <br>up partners to Allah indirectly. <br>Another hadith says with this meaning: <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>Certain categories of people will be called first of <br>all for reckoning on the Day of Judgement. A martyr <br>will be asked by Allah, \"Did I not bestow such and <br>such favours on you?\" He will admit those boons and <br>favours. Then Allah will ask him: \"How did you make <br>use of My favours?\" He will answer: \"I went to the <br>Holy War to please You, and was killed therein.\" Allah <br>will say: \"You lie; you participated in the Holy War to <br>be called a hero by people, and this has been done.\" <br>Then he will be thrown headlong into the fire of <br>Hell. Next, a scholar will be called and the same ques- <br>tions will be put to him. In reply he will admit the <br>favours of Allah. Then he will be asked: \"How did you <br>make use of My favours?\" He will answer, \"I acquired <br>knowledge of Islam and taught it to others, simply to <br>please You.\" Allah will say: \"You lie; you attained <br>knowledge in order to be called an aalim and recited <br>the Holy Qur'an to be called a qaari.\" Then he too will <br>be thrown headlong into the fire of Hell. Thereafter a <br>rich man will be called, and the same questions will be <br>put to him. He will say: \"I always spent money to <br>please Thee.\" Allah will say: \"You lie; you spent <br>money in order to be called a generous man, and this <br>has been said.\" Then he will also be thrown headlong <br>into the fire of Hell. <br>(Mishkaat) <br>Therefore, our preachers of Islam should always avoid <br>show and vanity, and should render their services only to <br>please Allah. They should follow the Sunnah of the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and should not desire <br>to win fame, or favour and appreciation of people. If such a <br>vain desire is suspected in their mind, they should seek the <br>refuge of Allah, and should ask His pardon. May Allah <br>grant us sincerity to serve His religion to the best of our ef- <br>forts. <br><br>CHAPTER 6 <br>RESPECT FOR LEARNING AND <br>THE LEARNED IN ISLAM <br>In this chapter, I would make a few submissions to the <br>Muslims in general that they may know how to respect the <br>scholars and the preachers of Islam. Today it is usual to <br>have unfounded misgivings and objections jigain>t.,Jhe <br>preachers and the learned men of the nation. this is very <br>harmful from the religious point of view. In every circle <br>and every institution of the world, there are good as well as <br>bad people; and if there are a few bad persons amongbthe <br>scholars also, it is no wonder. Two important consider- <br>ations are here noteworthy. Firstly. you should not form <br>any definite opinion about the character of anyone, unless <br>you have a solid proof about it. <br>Says Allah in the Holy Qur'an: <br>& ; <br>,<br>,<br>,<br>,<br>j<br>,<br>,. . <br>O<br>>. <br>.M1 <br>= a<br>a y <br>gp <br>\"And do not take practical steps regarding anything, <br>about which you have no knowledge; for everyone will <br>be questioned as to how he used his ears and eyes and <br>the heart.\" <br>And obviously it is unjust to reject the (good) advice of <br>a preacher, simply because you have some unconfirmed <br>doubts about him. <br>The Jews translated their scriptures into Arabic, and <br>used to read them out to the Muslims; but the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was so cautious about giving <br>his decision on this subject that he said: \"0 Muslims! you <br>should neither confirm what they say. nor reject them; <br>rather you should say: 'Whatever Allah has revealed, we <br>believe in all that.\"' In other words, he prohibited con-<br>tradiction of even an unbeliever's narration without proper <br>investigation. But contrary to this precept, we reject those <br>instructions of preachers that are against our wishes, with- <br>out any arguments on our part, and attack their reputation <br>even when we know them to be righteous. <br>CI <br><br>I<br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>Another thing that you must keep in mind is that even <br>the righteous scholars and preachers of your nation are also <br>human beings, and as such they too can have some weak- <br>nesses. The responsibility of their good or bad deeds really <br>rests on them and the final reckoning belongs to Allah: but <br>I hope that by His mercy and immense generosity He will <br>forgive them for after all they have been serving His Relig- <br>ion and Faith at great personal sacrifice throughout their <br>lives. In short, either to entertain doubts and objections <br>against the religious preacher himself, or spread them <br>amongst others, will take people away from religion and be <br>the cause of geat distress for those who participate in such <br>affairs. <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has <br>said: <br>\"Whoever respects the following three, he really pavs <br>respect to Allah: (1)An aged Muslim, (2) One who <br>teaches and preaches the Holy Qur'an without any <br>excess, (3)And a ruler who is just to the people.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>Also the following saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>iaho alaihe wasallam) tells us: <br>\"He is not among my followers, who does not respect <br>our elders, is not merciful to our youngsters, and does <br>not pay due reverence to our scholars.\" <br>\"Whoever belittles the following three persons is not a <br>Muslim but a hypocrite: first, an aged Muslim: second, <br>a scholar (of religion); and third, a just ruler.\" <br>The Holv Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also <br><br>said: \"I fear particularly for three shortcomings in my fol- <br>lowers. First, due to increasing worldly benefits and <br>achievements. they will envy one another; second, dis- <br>cussion of the Holy Qur'an will become so common that <br>even the ignorant will claim that they know the meanings <br>of the Holy Qur'an, although many meanings are such that <br>cannot be understood by anyone except the well versed <br>scholars of that Book, who say: \"We have a firm faith in it, <br>and that it is from Allah\", so how much more careful <br>should be the common people; third, the religious scholars <br>will be neglected and will not be patronized properly.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>Many similar traditions are found in the books of <br>hadith. It has been mentioned in 'Fataawa Aalamgiri' that <br>the sort of derogatory words that are generally used today <br>by the ignorant people about the scholars of Islam ma3 se- <br>riously damage their faith. Therefore, people must be care- <br>ful to avoid such words. Suppose for a moment there are <br>no true and sincere scholars of Islam in the world (and the <br>majority consists of corrupt people), even then nothing is <br>gained by branding them as evil scholars. Rather, it is the <br>religious and moral duty of every Muslim to form such an <br>Islamic society that would give birth to sincere servants of <br>Islam. Only when such a body of persons is in existence we <br>should rest content. <br>Of course, there have always been some differences of <br>opinion among the Muslim scholars, mostly about minor <br>problems, for which they cannot be maligned. There is a <br>hadith that says: \"The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa-<br>sallam) gave his shoes to Abu Hurairah (Radhivallaho <br>anho), and said: \"Take my shoes as a sign, and proclaim <br>among the Muslims that whoever will say 'La ilaha illallah, <br>Mohammadur Rasul-ullah' from the bottom of his heart, he <br>will certainly enter Paradise.\" Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) met Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) in the way <br>and asked him where he was going. He told him the mess- <br>age of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), yet <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was annoyed. for he <br>did not agree with such a proposition; therefore he hit the <br>messenger in the chest, who fell back. Yet no one raised ob- <br>jections against Hadhrat Umar (Radhivallaho anho), nor <br>was any demonstration arranged against him because of <br>this difference of opinion. Many differences of opinion <br>existed among the Sahabah and later the four Imaams of <br>Fiqh differed among themselves in numerous details. <br><br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>There have been many minor differences of opinion <br>about prayers among the four Imaams; I myself know of <br>about two hundred, but this does not mean that their fol- <br>lowers should doubt the faith of one another, and call each <br>other 'infidel'. The fact is that the common people are <br>mostly unaware of the finer points on which various schol- <br>ars differ in their views; these differences are a blessing in <br>disguise. As a matter of fact, good preachers and sincere <br>servants of Islam do not attach any importance to such tri- <br>fling things, but continue their attempt to bring people to <br>the Right Path. We know that doctors differ among them- <br>selves and lawyers differ in their advice, nevertheless <br>people continue to make use of their services. But those <br>who are ignorant, selfish and lazy, they simply use their <br>difference of views to raise objections against the religious <br>scholars. Anyhow, it has been enjoined on every Muslim to <br>listen to those scholars of the Holy Qur'an, whom he re- <br>spects and knows to be the followers of the Sunnah, and <br>should avoid reproaching those whom he does not like. <br>Anyone who has no proper knowledge of Islam and the <br>Holy Qur'an, has no right to raise objections against the <br>scholars. The scholars of Islam should always keep this <br>saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in <br>mind and act accordingly: \"It is to waste knowledge to ad- <br>dress those who are not fit for it.\" <br>In this corrupt age, when even the commandments of <br>Allah- and the sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) are being criticised, I have no reason to <br>wonder if the sermons of Muslim scholars are not heard <br>and the Qur'an not followed. Says Allah in the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>\"And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, <br>surely these are the unjust.\" <br><br>CHAPTER 7 <br>KEEPING COMPANY WITH THE RIGHTEOUS DIVINES <br>In this last chapter, which really completes the sixth <br>one, I would remind the Muslims to follow the Sunnah of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasalla'm), and to keep <br>the company of those who devote themselves to Islam and <br>remember Allah day and night, for this will make them <br>steadfast in Islam. Even the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) was commanded to keep such company; says <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)-on this sub- <br>ject: <br>\"Shall I tell you a thing by which you can attain good <br>C0 <br>8 9<br>in this world and the Hereafter? Remember, it is the gs<br>company of those who remember and glorify Allah day <br>S <br>and night.\" <br>(Mishkaat) <br>Now it is up to you to search for and to recognize the <br>true lovers of Allah and these are the followers of the <br>Sunnah, for Allah has sent his beloved Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) as a model for the guidance of the Mus- <br>lims. Says Allah in the Holy Qur'an: <br>0 Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! say: \"If you <br>people (really) love Allah, then follow me; so that <br>Allah will love you, and will pardon your sins; and <br>Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\" <br>Therefore, whoever follows the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) faithfully is nearer to Allah, and <br>whoever does not follow him is far away from Allah and <br>cannot win His favours. The commentators of the Holy <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>Qur'an have written that whoever claims to be a lover of <br>Allah, but does not follow the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he is a liar; for it is a requisite <br>of love that everything associated with the beloved must <br>be loved. A poet has quoted the words of the famous Qais- <br>'Aamir, the lover of Laila: <br>\".Whenever I pass through the city of Laila, I love <br>every door and wall of it. Really I do not love the city <br>as a city, but rather love the people in it who are asso- <br>ciated with Laila.\" Another poet says: <br>\"You pretend to be a lover of Allah, and yet you <br>do not obey His commandments! And I swear, in prac- <br>tise this i strange. If you were a true lover, you would <br>never dil<br>obey Him, for a lover always follows the <br>orders of his beloved.\" <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said: \"All my followers will enter Paradise, but not <br>those who have denied me.\" The Companions said: <br>\"Who would deny you?\" He said: \"Those who follow <br>me would enter Paradise, but those who disobey me, <br>they in fact deny me.\" <br>In another hadith, the Prophet (Sallailaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said. \"No one of you can be a true <br>Muslim unless his wishes are subordinate to that <br>which I have brought, that is the Holy Qur'an.\" <br>I <br>(Mishkaat) <br>I<br>I <br>One can hardly believe that those who claim to be <br>well-wishers of Islam and the Muslims would disobey <br>Allah and His Prophet. When we say that such and such <br>thing is against the Sunnah, they feel very annoyed; then <br>how can they be among the followers of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? <br><br>Ch. VII: Keeping company with the Righteous <br>Sa'di (Rahmatullah alaih) has said: <br>\"Whoever treads a path contrary to the Sunnah of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he will <br>never reach his destination.\" <br>Therefore, whoever keeps the company of true lovers <br>of Allah and followers of the Sunnah, in order to obtain <br>spiritual benefits. he will certainly progress towards salva- <br>tion. <br>On this particular subject, please consider the follow- <br>ing sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam): <br>\"Whenever you people pass through the Gardens <br>of Paradise, partake of their fruits.\" The Companions <br>asked: \"What are the Gardens of Paradise?\" The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) answered: \"The <br>assemblies wherein knowledge of Islam and the Holy <br>Qur'an is taught.\" <br>8,\" <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) $? <br>also said: \"Luqmaan instructed his son in these words: <br>\"Keep the company of scholars, and listen attentively <br>to the words of the wise, for therewith Allah revives <br>the dead hearts, just as He revives the dead earth with <br>heavy rains; and the wise alone understand the relig- <br>ion.\" <br>A Companion asked the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) \"Who can be the best companion for <br>us?\" He answered: \"Such a person that, when you see <br>him, you remember Allah; when you listen to him, <br>your knowledge of Islam is increased; when you see <br>his actions, you are reminded of the life Hereafter.\" <br>(Targheeb) <br>Again, \"The most devoted servants of Allah are <br>such that, when you see them you remember Allah.\" <br>Savs Allah in the Holy Qur'an: <br>Virtues of Tabligh <br>\"0 those who believe! Fear Allah, and be with the <br>truthful (faithful) people!\" <br>The commentators have written that by 'truthful' are <br>meant the mystics and the true lovers of Allah, for whoever <br>attaches himself to them and listens to their sermons, he at- <br>tains very high standards of spirituality. <br>Sheikh Akbar has written: \"You cannot get rid of the <br>evil wishes of yourself, though you may strive for it for <br>your whole life unless your desires are subjected to the <br>commandments of Allah and the Sunnah of the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). So, when you find a <br>true lovsr of Allah, serve him well and follow his instruc- <br>tions as though you have no will of your own; obey him in <br>all your spiritual, religious and personal problems, even <br>those concerning your occupation, so that he may lead you <br>to the right path and take you nearer to Allah.\" <br>Says the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) \"When a group of people remember Allah in a <br>meeting, then the angels surround that gathering, <br>Allah's mercy descends on them and Allah remembers <br>them in the assembly of Angels.\" What honour can be <br>greater for the believers than that Allah remembers and <br>appreciates them? Says the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam): \"An angel is sent to those who re- <br>member Allah sincerely, and he says 'Allah has for- <br>given your past sins, and has converted your bad deeds <br>into good ones'.\" <br>In another hadith, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) says: \"Any assembly of Muslims, <br>who do not remember Allah, (do not) send salutations <br>to His Messenger (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), will <br>face disappointment on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>There is a prayer of Hadhrat Dawood (Alayhis <br>salaam) in the following words: \"0 Allah! if you see <br>me neglecting the assembly of those who remember <br>Thee, and attending the assembly of transgressors, then <br>break my feet (that I may not be able to walk towards <br>them).\" <br>A poet has said, <br><br>Ch. VII: Keeping company with the Righteous <br>\"When I do not listen to Him and see His face, it is <br>better to be deaf and blind.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: <br>\"An assembly wherein Allah is remembered and glori- <br>fied, shines for the heavenly creatures, just as the stars <br>shine for the earthly creatures.\" <br>Once, Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>went to a bazaar and proclaimed to the people: \"0 <br>brethren! You are sitting here, and the legacy of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is being dis- <br>tributed in the mosque.\" The people ran to the <br>mosque, but as nothing material was being distributed <br>there, they returned disappointed. Hadhrat Abu Hurai- <br>rah (Radhiyallaho anho) asked them. \"After all what <br>was being done there?\" They answered: \"A few people <br>were reading the Holy Qur'an, and a few others were <br>engaged in praising and glorifying Allah.\" He said: <br>\"This is what we call the legacy of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>Imam Ghazali (Rahmatullah alaih) has mentioned <br>many similar traditions. Even the Holy Prophet (Sallal- 'ij3 -2'<br>a<br>laho alaihe wasallam) has been commanded by Allah: <br>,= <br>&d, +, Lj&> <br>$,j& gj$+& $j, <br>s g<br>3,; <br>&>,,+ <br>*,:, <br>u$i > @ &,> *5, GjJ, <br>& <br>* s o ,  <br>F J  , , <br>-j 4 fw <br>' >' <br>, > e  <br>, , <br>( Y *  &J\\) <br>&) 091is,L> <br>\"0Messenger! keep the company of those who pray to <br>Allah every morning and evening, and they desire only <br>His pleasure; and do not turn your eyes from them to <br>the attractions and adornment of the worldly life: and <br>do not follow him whose heart We have turned away <br>from our remembrance, and who follows his desires, <br>and (therefore) he has broken the limits (of true re!@- <br>ion).\" <br>Numerous traditions indicate that the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to thank Allah for pro- <br>ducing such pious people among his followers that he was <br>commanded to keep their company. And in the same verse, <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has been <br>commanded to avoid the company of those who are slaves <br>of passion and tresspass the limits laid down by Allah. He <br>has been instructed again and again not to follow their vain <br>desires. <br>Virtues o<br>Now all those who blind<br>godly and transgressing peop<br>should search their hearts an<br>lievers.

It is a month in which Allah has made Fasting compulsory by day. And has made sunnah the Taraaweeh by <br>night. Whosoever intends drawing near to Allah by performing any virtuous deed, for such person shall be the <br>reward like the one who had performed a fardh in any other time. And whoever performs a fardh, shall be blessed <br>with the reward of seventy faraa-idh in any other time. <br>This is indeed the month of patience, and the reward for true patience is Jannah (paradise). It is the month of <br>sympathy with one's fellowmen. It is the month wherein a true believer's rizq is increased. Whosoever feeds another <br>who fasted, in order to break the fast at sunset, for the feeder there shall be forgiveness of sins and emancipation <br>from the fire of Jahannam (hell}, and for such feeder shall be the same reward as the one who Fasted (who he fed) <br>without that persons reward being decreased in the least.\" <br>Thereupon we said, \"0 messenger of Allah, not all of us possess the means whereby we can give a fasting <br>person to break his fast.\" Rasulullah (SAW) replied, \"Allah grants the same reward to the one who gives a fasting <br>person to break the fast a mere date, or a drink of water, or a sip of milk.\" <br>\"This is a month, the first of which brings Allah's mercy, the middle of which brings His forgiveness and the <br>last of which brings emancipation from the fire of Jahan-nam.\" <br>\"Whosoever lessens the burden of his servants (bonds-men) in this month; Allah will forgive him and free him <br>from the fire of Jahannam.\" <br>\"And in this month four things you should continue to perform in great number, two of which shall be to <br>please your Lord, while the other two shall be those without which you cannot do. Those which shall be to please <br>your Lord, are that you should in great quantity bear witness that there is no deity to worship except Allah (i.e. <br>recite the Kalimah Tayyibah Laa llaaha illallaah) and make much Istighfaar beg Allah's forgiveness with <br>Astagirfirul-laah).\" And as for those without which you cannot do, you should beg of Allah, entrance into paradise <br>and ask refuge in Him from Jahannam.\" <br><br>\"And whoever gave a person who fasted water to drink, Allah shall grant that giver to drink from my fountain, <br>such a drink where after that person shall never again feel thirsty until he enters Jannah.\" <br>Reported by ibn Khuzaimah in his 'Saheeh. <br>COMMENTARY <br>All the points which this Hadith draws attention have been further emphasized in numerous other Ahaadith on <br>the great virtues of Ramadan. Quite a number of important points are brought to our notice. <br>Firstly, it should be noted that Rasulullah (SAW) delivered this sermon at the end of the month of Sha-baan the <br>obvious reason being that he intended to put into our minds the great importance of Ramadan so that we could <br>remember and not allow one second of this month to go by without giving it the full importance it deserves. <br>Thereafter attention is drawn to Laylatul Qadr, about which more is said later. Then attention is drawn to the fact <br>that fasting has been made compulsory by Allah who also made Sunnah the Taraaweeh 'salaah by night. <br>From this Hadith it is noted that the command for Taraaweeh prayers too comes from Allah Himself. Besides <br>this in all the Ahaadith wherein Rasulullah (SAW) says, I have made it sunnah\", is mainly to emphasize its <br><br>importance. All the authorities of the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa'ah are agreed upon the fact that Taraaweeh is <br>Sunnah. (Bur-haan mentions that only the Rawaafidh deny this.) <br>Maulana Shaah Abdulhaq Dehlawi wrote in his book: \"Maa Thabata Bis sunnah\" that should the people of any <br>town fail to perform Taraaweeh prayers, the Muslim ruler should make them do so by force. <br> HADITH No. 2 <br>Abu Hurayrah relates that Rasulullah (SAW) said, \"My Ummah was given five things for Ramadan which <br>was not given to anyone except them. For them, the smell from the mouth of a fasting person is more sweeter to <br>Allah than the fragrant smell of musk. On their behalf the fish in the sea seek forgiveness for the fasting persons <br>until they break their fast. Allah prepares and decorates a special garden in Jannah everyday and then says (to it), <br>\"The time is near when faithful servants shall cast aside the great trials of the world and come to you\". In this <br>month (for them) evil-minded Shaytaan is chained so as not to reach unto those evils to which they normally <br>reach during other months besides Ramadan. On the last night of Ramadan they are forgiven\". <br>The Sahaabah R.A. thereupon enquired, \"0 Messenger of Allah, is that last night Laylatul Qadr? Rasulullah <br>(SAW) replied, \"No. But it is only right that a servant should be given his reward on having completed his <br>service\". <br>Reported by Ahmad, Bazzaar and Bayhaqi <br>HADITH No. 3 <br> <br>Kaab bin Ujra relates, \"Rasulullah (SAW) said, \"Come near to the mimbar\". And we came near to the mimbar. <br>When he ascended the First step of the mimbar he said \"Aameen\". When he ascended the second step of the <br>mimbar he said, \"Aameen\". When he ascended the third step he said, \"Aameen\".  <br>When he descended we said, \"0 Rasul of Allah, we have heard from you today something which we never <br>heard before\". He said, When I ascended the first step) Jibra-eel A.S. appeared before me and said, \"Woe to him <br>who found the blessed month of Ramadan and let it pass by without gaining forgiveness\", upon that I said, <br>\"Aameen\". When I ascended the second step, he said \"Woe to him before whom thy name is mentioned and then <br>does not read Durood (salaat alan Nabi) on you\". I replied \"Aameen\". When I ascended the third step he said, \"Woe <br>unto the person in whose presence both parents or one of them attain old age, and (through failure to serve them) is <br>not allowed to enter Jannah\" I said \"Aameen\". <br><br>Reported by Haakim. <br>HADITH NO. 4 <br>Ubaadah bin Saamit (Radhiallaahu \u00c1nhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said one day when <br>Ramadan had drawn near; \"The month of Ramadan, the month of blessings has come to you, wherein Allah turns <br>towards you and sends down to you His special Mercy, forgives your faults, accepts prayers, appreciates your <br>competition for the greatest, good and boasts to the angels about you. So, show to Allah your righteousness; for <br>verily, the most pitiable and unfortunate one is he who is deprived of Allah's Mercy in this month. <br>COMMENTARY <br>In this Hadith, we read about the spirit of competition among the believers, each one trying to do more good deeds <br>than the other. In our own home, I am greatly pleased on seeing how even the womenfolk vie with each other, the <br>one trying to recite more of the Qur\u2019an than the others, so that, in spite of domestic responsibilities, fifteen to <br>twenty 'juz' (Parts) of the Qur\u2019an are read by each one daily. I mention this only out of a sense of gratitude to Allah, <br>mentioning His favor, and not to boast of it. May Allah accept their deeds and ours, and increase us all in good <br>deeds.  <br><br> <br>HADITH NO.5 <br>Abu Saeed Khudri (Radhiallaahu anhu) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: \"During each day <br>and night of Ramadan, Allah sets free a great number of souls from Hell. And for every Muslim, during each day <br>and night, at least one prayer is certainly accepted.\"  <br>COMMENTARY <br>Apart from this Hadith, there are many others stating that the 'Du'aa' of a fasting person is accepted (Mustajaab). In <br>one Hadith, we read that the 'Du\u2019aa\u2019 is accepted at the time of 'Iftaar', but we are generally so absorbed in eating <br>that we neglect this opportunity. The well-known 'Du\u2019aa' at 'Iftaar' is:  <br>\"O Allah for You have I fasted, in You do I believe, and on You do I rely, and now I break this fast with food <br>coming from you.\"  <br>Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiallaahu anhu) used to make the following 'Du\u2019aa' at 'Iftaar':  <br>O Allah I beg You, through Your infinite Mercy, which surrounds all things, to forgive me.' <br>In some books we read that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) used to say: <br>\"O You who are Great in Bounties, forgive me.\" <br>Many other prayers have been indicated for 'Iftaar', but no special 'Dua' is fixed. This time (at Iftaar) is one when <br>'Du\u2019aa' is accepted; submit before Allah all your needs (and, if you remember, then make \"Du'aa' for me too.)  <br>HADITH NO. 6 <br>Abu Hurayrah (Radhiallaahu anhu) reports: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: \"There are three people <br>whose \"Du'aa\" is not rejected; the fasting person until he breaks the fast, the just ruler, and the oppressed person, <br>whose 'Dua' Allah lifts above the clouds and opens unto it the doors of heaven, and Allah says: \"I swear by My <br>honor, verily I shall assist you, even though it may be after some time.\"  <br>COMMENTARY <br>In 'Durr Manthur' it is reported from Aa'isha (Radhiallaahu anha) that when Ramadan appeared the color of<br><br>In Durr Manthur  it is reported from Aa isha (Radhiallaahu anha) that, when Ramadan appeared, the color of <br>Rasulullah's face used to change. He then used to increase his \"Salaat\", become even more humble in his \"Duaas\" <br>and exhibit even more fear of Allah. According to another report, he hardly ever lay down in bed until Ramadan <br>came to an end. Further, it is stated that the angels carrying the Throne are commanded in Ramadan to leave aside <br>everything else and recite \"Aameen\" to the \"Duaas\" of those who fast. Numerous are the Ahaadith stating that the <br>fasting person's 'Duaas' are answered. When Allah has so promised. and his truthful 'Nabi' (Sallallaahu alaihi <br>wasallam) has informed us, there should be no doubt whatsoever about the truth of these reports. Yet it is strange <br>that, in spite of this, we still find such people who apparently do not get what they pray for. They ask and do not <br>receive; but this does not mean that their prayers have been rejected. One should at this point understand the <br>significance of a 'Dua' being answered. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) has informed us that, when a Muslim prays for anything from Allah, on the <br>condition that he does not pray for breaking off from his near of kin or for anything sinful, he definitely receives <br>one out of the following three things: he gets the exact thing which he asked. If that is not received, then Allah <br>either removes from his path some great calamity in exchange for what he desired, or the reward for that thing for <br>which he prayed is stored for him in the Hereafter. Another Hadith states that on the day of \"Qiyaamah\", Allah will <br>call his servant, and say to him: \"O my servant, I used to command you to ask of Me and promised to answer. Did <br><br>you beg of Me? The servant will answer: \"Yes I did.\" Then Allah shall reply: \"You did not put forth any prayer <br>which has not been accepted. You prayed that a certain calamity should be removed, which I did for you in the <br>worldly life. You prayed that a certain sorrow should be cast off you, but result of that prayer was not known to <br>you. For that, I fixed for you such and such a reward in the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) says <br>that the man shall again be reminded of each and every prayer and he shall be shown how it had been fulfilled in <br>the world or else what reward had been stored for him in the Hereafter. On seeing that reward, he shall wish that <br>not a single prayer of his had been answered on Earth, so that he could receive the full reward only in the Hereafter.  <br>Yes, prayer is indeed very important, and to neglect it at any time is a matter of great loss. Even when the outward <br>signs seem to indicate that our prayer is not answered, hope should not be lost. Even from the lengthy Hadith at the <br>end of this booklet, it is clear that Allah in answering prayers considers first of all our own good and welfare. <br>Should Allah find that granting us what we beseech from Him is in our welfare and interest, He grants it, otherwise <br>not. Actually it is Allah's favor on us that we do not always get what we ask for because very often, due to our lack <br>of understanding, we beg for things that are not beneficial at a particular time.  <br>Here I must draw your attention to the fact that men as well as women suffer from a bad habit of cursing their <br>children in their anger and affliction. Beware of this. As preordained by Allah, there are certain occasions when <br>whatever prayer be made is immediately answered. So sometimes, due to our own stupidity, the child is cursed and <br>when the effect of that same curse comes upon the child and lands him into a calamity, the parents go about crying <br>and wailing. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) commanded us not to curse ourselves, our children, <br>possessions, or servants. It is just possible that the curse is uttered at a time when all requests are granted, especially <br>in Ramadan, which is replete with such special \"Mustajaab\" (accepted) moments. Hence, in this month, great care <br>should be taken. <br>Ibn Masood (Radhi Allaho anhu) reports that on every night of Ramadan, a crier from the heavens calls out: \"O you <br>seeker of good, come near; O You seeker of evil, turn away (from evil) and open your eyes.\" Thereafter that angel <br>calls out: \"Is there any seeker of forgiveness, that he may be forgiven? Is there anyone with a prayer, that his prayer <br>may be heard? Is there anyone wanting anything, so that his wish may be fulfilled?\"  <br>Lastly, it should be borne in mind that there are certain conditions under which prayers are accepted; in the absence <br>of these, prayers may be often rejected. Among these is the use of 'Halaal' food: When 'Haraam' is consumed, the <br><br>, p y<br>y<br>j<br>g<br>,<br>prayers are not accepted. Rasulullah said: \"Many a greatly distressed person lifts up his hands to the heavens. <br>praying and crying: 'O Allah, O Allah.' But the food he eats is \"Haraam\", what he drinks is \"Haraam\", his clothes <br>are of \"Haraam\"; then in such cases how can his prayer be accepted?'  <br>A story is related about a group of people in Kufa, whose prayers used to be always accepted. Whenever a (bad) <br>ruler was placed over them, they used to pray for a curse upon him, which quickly came to destroy him. When <br>Hajjaaj became ruler there, he invited these people amongst others, to a feast. After they had all eaten, he said: \"I <br>am no longer afraid of the curse upon me from these people, because \"Haraam\" food has now entered their <br>stomachs.\" (At this stage, let us ponder over how much \"Haraam\" is being consumed in these times, when people <br>are even trying to make permissible the taking of interest money. We find out people going so far as to think that <br>bribery and what is obtained through it is permissible, while our merchants very often justify their deceiving people <br>when trading with them.)  <br>HADITH NO. 7 <br>Ibn Umar (Radhi Allaho anhu) relates: Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: 'Verily Allah and His <br>Malaa'ikah send Mercy upon those who eat 'Sehri' (sower-Suhoor).\"  <br><br>COMMENTARY <br>How great is Allah's favor upon us that even the partaking of food before dawn for fasting is so greatly rewarded. <br>There are many Ahaadith in which the virtues of \"Sehri\" are expounded and the rewards mentioned. Allaamah Ain <br>- Commentator on Bukhari - has quoted the virtues of \"Sehri\" from seventeen different 'Sahaabah' and all the <br>\"Ulama\" are agreed on its being \"Mustahab\" (desirable). Many people are deprived of this great reward because of <br>their own laziness. Some even go so far as to finish 'Taraaweeh', eat (what they suppose to be \"Sehri'!) and go to <br>bed. What great blessings do they lose! \"Sehri\" actually means partaking of food shortly before dawn. Some <br>authorities say that the time for \"Sehri\" commences after half the night has passed (Mirquat). The author of Kash-<br>shaff (Zamakhshari) divided the night into six portions, stating that the last one of these is the time of \"Sehri\"; so <br>that, when the night (from sunset till dawn) extends over twelve hours, the last two hours would be the correct time <br>for \"Sehri\". Then it must also be remembered that to eat at the latest possible time is better and greater in reward <br>than eating earlier, subject to the condition that no doubt remains as to whether \"Sehri\" had been eaten before the <br>time of dawn. The Ahaadith are full of virtues of \"Sehri\".  <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: 'The difference between our fasting and that of the Ahlul-Kitaab <br>(Jews and Christians) lies in our partaking of food at \"Sehri\" which they do not.\" The Prophet has said, \"Eat Sehri, <br>because in it lie great blessings; and again.\u201dIn three things, are the great blessings: in \"Jamaa\u2019ah\" (company), in <br>eating \"Thareed\" and in \"Sehri\". In this Hadith, the use of the word \"Jama'ah\" is general, wherefrom we deduce that <br>it includes \"Salaat\" with \"Jamaa'ah\" and all those righteous deeds done in company, as thus Allah's help comes to <br>them. \"Thareed\" is a tasty preparation, in which baked bread is cooked with meat. The third thing mentioned in this <br>Hadith is \"Sehri\". When Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) used to invite any of the companions to eat <br>\"Sehri\" with him, he used to say: \"Come and partake of blessed food with me.\" One Hadith says: \"Eat 'Sehri' and <br>strengthen yourself for the fast. And sleep in the afternoon (Siesta), so as to gain assistance in waking up in the <br>latter portion of the night (for \"Ibaadah\").\" Abdullah bin Haarith (Radhiallaahu Anhu) reports that one of the <br>Sahaaba said: \"I once visited Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) at a time when he was busy in partaking of <br>'Sehri'. Rasulullah then said: \"This is a thing full of blessings, which Allah has granted you. Do not give it up.\" <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) in urging us repeatedly for 'Sehri' has said: \"Even though there be no food, <br>then one date should be eaten or a drink of water taken.\" Thus, when there are definitely great advantages and <br>reward in 'Sehri', Muslims should endeavour to observe this practice as much as possible. However, in all things <br>moderation is important, and going beyond the bounds of moderation is harmful: neither should so little be eaten <br>that one feels weak throughout the period of fasting, nor should so much be eaten that it causes discomfort. <br><br>Repeatedly, we have been prohibited from filling the stomach excessively.  <br>In his commentary on \"Sahih Bukhari\", Ibne Hajar has mentioned various reasons for the blessedness of \"Sehri\":  <br>\u2022 <br>Because in it, the 'Sunnah' is followed.  <br>\u2022 <br>Through \"Sehri\", we differentiate ourselves from the ways of Ahlul-Kitaab, which we are at all times called <br>upon to do.  <br>\u2022 <br>It provides strength for \"Ibaadah\"  <br>\u2022 <br>It promotes greater sincerity in \"Ibaadah\"  <br>\u2022 <br>It aids in elimination of bad temper, which normally comes about as result of hunger.  <br>\u2022 <br>'Sehri' is the time when prayers are accepted.  <br>\u2022 <br>At the time of 'Sehri', one gets the opportunity to remember Allah, makes Dhikr and lifts up the hand to <br>Him in prayer.  <br>These are a few of the major reasons; there are many others as well. Some 'Sufis' are in doubt as to whether the <br>eating of 'Sehri' conflicts with the object of fasting or not. They maintain that the object of fasting is to stay away <br><br>from food, drink and sexual desires, therefore 'Sehri' is against the object of fasting. In my opinion the amount to be <br>eaten varies according to different persons and their activities. Foe example, for those students who are busy <br>seeking knowledge of 'Deen', too little food at 'Sehri' as well as 'Iftaar' will be harmful; for them it is better not to <br>have too little, because they seek 'Deeni' knowledge, which is very important (for the preservation and spread of <br>Islam). similar is the case of those who are busy with 'Dhikr' and other 'Deeni' activities. Other people who have no <br>such hard work to do should eat little at 'Sehri'. <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) announced to those proceeding for 'Jihaad': 'There is no virtue in <br>fasting while travelling.' That was in the month of Ramadan, when some Sahaaba were fasting. Allamah Sha'raani <br>mentions in Sharh Iqna: 'A covenant was made with us that we shall not fill our stomachs (completely) when <br>eating, especially in the nights of Ramadan.' It is better that one should eat less in the nights of Ramadan than on <br>other nights. After all, what is the utility of fasting after having filled oneself at 'Sehri' and 'Iftaar'? the religious <br>divines have said, 'Whoever remains hungry in Ramadan shall remain safe from the evil of 'Shaytaan' throughout <br>the year, until the next Ramadan.' <br>Sharah Ihya Ulumuddin mentions the experiences of some saints, such as Sahl bin Abdullah Tastari, who used to <br>eat only once every fifteen days, while in Ramadan he ate only one morsel; but in order to follow the Sunnah, he <br>used to have a drink of water daily for 'Sehri' and 'Iftaar'. Shaykh Junayd always used to fast throughout the year. <br>However, when his noble friends would visit him occasionally, he used to break his fast and eat with them, saying, <br>'The virtue of breaking fast and eating with (such noble) friends is not less than that of 'Nafl' fasting. <br>Similarly, we can mention the experiences of numerous saints who through eating less used to discipline their <br>inner-selves, but let us bear in mind that it should not be carried to such extremes that the'religious' activities and <br>responsibilities are neglected, as a result of weakness of the body.  <br>HADITH NO. 8 <br>Abu,Hurayra (Radhiallaahu \u00c1nhu) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said: \"Many of those who <br>fast obtain nothing through such fasting except hunger, and many a one performs \"Salaat\" by' night but obtains <br>nothing by it, except the discomfort of staying awake.\" <br>COMMENTARY<br><br>COMMENTARY <br>With regard to this Hadith, the \"Ulama\" have mentioned three different interpretations: First, this Hadith may refer <br>to those who fast during the day and then for \"Iftaar\" eat food that is \"Haraam\"; all the reward for fasting is lost <br>because of the greater sin of eating 'Haraam' and nothing is gained except remaining hungry. Secondly, it may mean <br>those who fast duly but, during fasting, engage themselves in backbiting and slandering others (see later). Thirdly, <br>the person referred to may be one who, while fasting, did not stay away from evil and sin. In this Hadith all such <br>possibilities are included. Similar is the case of the person performing 'Salaat' all night voluntarily; because of <br>backbiting or any other sinful act (e.g. missing, Fajr salaat or keeping Awake for show), his night of devotion goes <br>unrewarded.  <br>HADITH NO. 9 <br>Abu Ubaidah (Radhiallaahu \u00c1nhu) reports: \"I have heard RasuluLlah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) saying: <br>\"Fasting is a protective Shield for Man, as long as he does not tear up that protection'  <br>COMMENTARY <br>\"Protective shield\" here means just as a man protects himself with a shield, similarly fasting protects him from his <br>well-known enemy - 'Shataan'. In other Ahaadith, we are told that fasting saves one from Allah's punishment and <br><br>Hellfire in the Hereafter. Once somebody inquired from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam), \"What causes <br>the fast to be rent?\" He replied: 'Telling lies and backbiting.'  <br>This Hadith, when read in conjunction with so many others, actually tells us to avoid such actions which cause <br>fasting to be wasted. In our times, we are fond of whiling away the time with unnecessary conversations. Some <br>\"Ulema\" are of the opinion that lies, backbiting, slander, etc., actually undo the fast just like eating and drinking, <br>but the great majority of \"Ulama\" believes that the fast is not totally undone, but loses its blessings. The \"Ulama\" of <br>Islam have mentioned six things, about which care should be taken in fasting:- First, one should keep the eyes away <br>from any place where one should not look; some go so far as to prohibit looking at one's own wife with desire, let <br>alone another woman. Similarly, looking at any evil action or where evil is committed should be avoided. <br>Rasulullah(Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said: 'The glance is like an arrow from 'Shataan' Whosoever, out of fear <br>for Allah, prevents himself from lookig at evil, Allah shall grant him such light of faith, the taste and ecstacy of <br>which he will feel in the heart.\" The 'Sufis' interpret the above saying to mean that those sights which should be <br>avoided include all such places and things that distract the mind from the remembrance of Allah.  <br>Secondly, one should guard the tongue against lies, unnecessary conversation, backbiting, arguments, swearing, etc. <br>In Bukhari, we read that fasting is a shield for the fasting person; for this reason, those who fast should avoid all <br>useless talk, joking, argument, etc. Should anyone pick an argument, then say: \"I am fasting.\" In other words, one <br>should not start an argument and if someone else starts it, then too, one should avoid taking it up. When the person <br>who starts an argument is not an understanding person, then at least one should remind oneself that: \"I am fasting.\" <br>During the time of our Nabi (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam), two women were fasting and suffered the pangs of <br>hunger to such an extent that the fast became unbearable and both were on the point of death. The \"Sahaaba\" <br>brought this to the notice of our Nabi (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam), who sent a bowl commanding them to vomit <br>into it. When they both vomitted in the bowl, pieces of meat and fresh blood were found in it. The \"Sahaaba\" were <br>greatly surprised, upon which our Nabi (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said: \"They fasted with 'Halaal' food from <br>Allah, but partook of 'Haraam' food by backbiting other people.\" From the above, it also becomes clear that, by <br>backbiting during fasting, the fast becomes so much more harder; for this reason, both women were near death. <br>Similar is the case with other sinful acts, and experience shows that for the faithful, Godfearing persons, fasting is <br>no hardship, whereas the sinful find it too hard to bear. One should therefore stay away from sins and especially <br>from major sins, like backbiting and slander, which are often indulged in to while away the time. Allah says in the <br>Qur\u2019an that backbiting is tantamount to the (actual) eating of the flesh of one's dead brother. We find this also <br>\u00c1<br><br>narrated in various Ahadith. Once the Prophet, (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam), on seeing some people, asked them <br>to pick their teeth. They said that they had not tasted any meat that day, on which the Prophet (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi <br>Wasallam) said, \"So and so's flesh is sticking to your teeth.\" It transpired that they had been backbiting. May Allah <br>keep us safe from this evil, because we are very neglectful of this warning. All are guilty of this; not to speak of the <br>common man, even the people of importance indulge in it, even the religious people in their gatherings do not avoid <br>backbiting. Worst of all is the fact that we do not even realize what backbiting is; even when we suspect ourselves <br>of this, we try to cover it up as narration of some event. One of the 'Sahaaba' inquired from Rasulullah (Sallallaahu <br>\u00c1layhi Wasallam) \"What is backbiting?\" Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) replied: \"To mention something <br>about your brother behind his back, which he would resent.\" The 'Sahaabi' then said: \"And is it still backbiting if <br>the thing mentioned about him is really true?\" Our Nabi (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said: 'In that case (if that <br>which was mentioned is really true) it is precisely backbiting; but if what is mentioned is false, then you have in <br>fact slandered him.\" Once our Nabi (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) passed by two graves. He said: \"On both the <br>inmates of these graves, punishment is being inflicted in the grave. One is being punished because of backbiting, <br>the other because of not having taken precautions (to stay clean) when passing urine. Rasulullah ((Sallallaahu <br>\u00c1layhi Wasallam) also said: \"There are more than seventy degrees of evil in (Usury) interest. The lowest form of it <br>is comparable to committing incest with own mother; and taking one 'Dirham' of interest is a worse evil than having <br>fornicated thirty five times. The worst and most evil degree of taking interest is the slandering of a Muslim.\" In <br><br>various Ahaadith we are strongly warned against backbiting and slandering a Muslim. I very much wanted to write <br>down here a number of such Ahaadith, because all our gatherings and conversations are generally filled with these <br>evils (backbiting and slander). However I finally decided not to do so, because the topic under discussion here is <br>something else - not actually backbiting. So I once again pray that Allah may keep us safe from this evil. And I beg <br>of my friends and brothers to pray for me too; we are full of inner faults.  <br>'What ailment is there O Allah that is not in me,  <br>Heal me from every illness and grant me my needs <br>Verily I have a heart that is sick <br>Verily you are the Healer of the sick' <br>Thirdly, we should be careful that the ears are kept away from listening to anything undesirable (Makrooh). It is <br>equally unlawful to listen to anything that should not be said. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) has said, <br>'In backbiting, both the bickbiter and the one who listens to it are equal partners in sin.' <br>Fourthly, the rest of the body should be kept away from sin and unlawful things. Neither should the hands touch it, <br>nor the feet walk towards it. With the stomach, special care should be taken, especially at the time of \"Iftaar\", that <br>no such thing enters it about which there is any doubt of it being \"Halaal\". When a person fasts and, at.\"Iftaar\" time, <br>breaks his fast with \"Haraam\" food, he is like a sick person who takes medicine as a cure, but also adds a little <br>poison, which destroys him. <br>Fifthly, after having fasted, it is not advisable to fill the stomach completely even with \"Halaal\" food at \"Iftaar\", <br>because then the purpose of fasting is defeated. Fasting seeks to diminish one's carnal desires and increase one's <br>faith and spiritual powers. For eleven months, we eat and drink freely enough, in Ramadan this should be cut down <br>to a minimum. We have a bad habit of filling our bellies at \"Iftaar\" to make up for what was lost, and again at <br>\"Sahi\" in preparation for the day, thus actually increasing our average consumption. Ramadan for such people gives <br>an edge to their appetite. Many such items of food are eaten that we normally do not eat at other times. This type of <br>eating habit is completely against the spirit of Ramadan and the true spirit of fasting.  <br>Imaam Ghazaali asks the same question: \"When the object of fasting is to conquer our carnal passions in opposition <br>to 'Iblees' (Satan), how can this possibly be done by eating excessively at \"Iftaar\"? Actually in that case we have<br><br>to Iblees  (Satan), how can this possibly be done by eating excessively at Iftaar ? Actually in that case we have <br>only altered the times of eating, and not really fasted. In fact by having various types of delicacies, we consume <br>even more than in normal times. The result is that, instead of lessening the carnal desires, these are considerably <br>increased. The real benefit of fasting comes as a result of actual hunger in the 'true sense. Our Nabi (Sallallaahu <br>\u00c1layhi Wasallam) said: 'Shataan\" flows through the body of man like blood; so, close up his path by remaining <br>hunqry,\" i.e. when the body is hungry, the spirit receives strength.  <br>Apart from hunger, fasting gives us an opportunity to appreciate the condition of the poor and destitute, and thus <br>engenders sympathetic feelings towards them. This too can be attained by remaining hungry and not by filling the <br>stomach with delicious foods at 'Sehri\", so that one does not feel hungry until \"Iftaar\". Once a person went to Bishr <br>Haafi, whom he found shivering in the cold, in spite of having warm clothes lying at his side. That person inquired: <br>\"Is this a time for taking off the clothes?\" Bishr replied: \"There are numerous poor and needy ones; I am unable to <br>sympathise with them; the least I could do is to be in their condition.\" The 'Sufis' plead for the same attitude in <br>fasting and so do the \"Fuqahaa\" (Jurists).  <br>In Maraqiul Falaah, it is written. \"Do not eat excessively at \"Sehri\", as this is a way to lose the object of fasting.\" <br>Allama Tahtaawi writes: \"When hunger is really felt, the reward for fasting becomes definitely more. Similarly, a <br><br>feeling is developed for the poor and hungry ones\". Our Nabi (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) himself said: 'Allah <br>does not dislike the filling of anything to the brim more than He dislikes the filling of the stomach. On another <br>occasion, the Prophet ((Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said, \"A few morsels should suffice which can keep back <br>straight.\" The best way for man is that one third should be filled with food, one third with drink while the other <br>third remains empty.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) himself used to fast for days on end, without <br>eating in between.  <br>I have seen my ustaaz (teacher) Maulana Khalil Ahmad eating only slightly more than one thin (hand-made) bread <br>(roti) at 'Iftaar' and 'Sehri', during the whole month of Ramadan. When any of his near ones used to urge him to eat <br>more, he would reply: \"I am not hungry.  <br>I merely sat down to eat because of my friends.\" About Maulana Shah Abdurraheem Rajpuri, I have heard that in <br>Ramadan, for days on end, he used to fast, drinking at 'Iftaar' and 'Sehri' only a few cups of tea without milk and <br>nothing else. Once his most trusted follower (and Khalifa) Maulana Shah Abdulqaadir remarked with anxiety: <br>\"Hazrat, you will become very weak if you do not eat anything.\" To this, Maulana Shah Rajpuri replied: \"Praise be <br>to Allah, I am experiencing something of the ecstasy of Jannah.'May Allah grant us all the ability to follow those <br>Pious souls.Aameen'. <br>The sixth point is that, after fasting, one should always have some anxiety as to whether one's fast had been <br>accepted by Allah or not. This should be the case with all forms of 'Ibaadah' (worship). One never knows whether <br>some important part may have been left out, of which no notice was taken. One should always fear that Allah may <br>reject one's deeds. Rasulullah (Sallallaahu \u00c1layhi Wasallam) said: 'Many reciters of the Qur'an are being cursed by <br>the Qur'an.' He also said: 'On the day of 'Qiyaamah', (judgement) one of those with whom Allah shall reckon first <br>shall be a \"Shaheed\" (martyr in the path of Allah). Allah shall call him and remind him of all His favours to him, <br>which he shall admit.  <br>He shall then be asked: \"What have you done by way of expressing gratitude for these favours?\" The 'Shaheed' <br>shall reply: 'I fought in Your cause till I became a 'Shaheed\". Allah shall reply:\"It is not so; you fought so that you <br>can be called a brave man; and so it has been said\" Thereafter, it shall be commanded that he be dragged face on the <br>ground and cast into \"Jahannam.\" Thereafter, an 'Aalim' (Scholar) shall be called. He too shall be reminded of <br>Allah's favours and asked the same question. He shall reply: \"O Lord! I sought to acquire knowledge, taught others <br><br>q<br>p y<br>g<br>q<br>g ,<br>g<br>and for Your sake recited the Qur\u2019an.\" Allah shall say: \"This is not true.  <br>You did all that, merely so that, it may be said that you are learned; and so, it has been said.' Then it shall be <br>commanded that he too be dragged, face on the ground, and cast into \"Jahannam.\" Thereafter a rirh man shall be <br>called. After being reminded of Allah's favours, and admitting them, in reply to Allah's question as to what he did <br>fo express His gratitude, he shall reply: \"There was no worthycause wherein I did not spend in charity for Your <br>sake.\" Allah's reply shall be: 'Not true. You did all that, so that it may be said that you are very generous. And so it <br>has been said.\" Then it shall be commanded that he too be dragged, face on the ground, and cast into \"Jahannam\". <br>Many such incidents are related in Ahaadith. So, a fasting person should not only be sincere but also hope that <br>Allah will accept it.  <br>These above mentioned six things are compulsory for all truly righteous persons. As for the exceptionally pious <br>ones, a seventh point is added. That is, during fasting, the heart should not be turned towards anyone except Allah, <br>so much so that during the course of the fast there should be no worry as to whether there shall be something to eat <br>for 'Iftaar'.  <br><br>Some Shaikhs even consider it a fault to think about food for 'Iftaar', or that one should endeavour to acquire <br>something, because this shows lack of faith in Allah's promise of being responsible for the granting of \"Rizq\". In <br>the commentary of 'Ihya Ulumid Deen, the author goes so far as to relate that, should something for \"Iftaar\" arrive <br>from somewhere before the time of 'Iftaar', the \"Mashaikh\" would give it to somebody else, for fear that for the rest <br>of that day the heart may be distracted from Allah by keeping it. This can of course, only be carried out by the <br>exceptionally pious ones. We cannot even imagine having such strong faith. Should we try to follow without it, we <br>may destroy ourselves. <br>The Qur\u2019an commands: \"Fasting has been prescribed for you.\" The commentators of the Qur\u2019an say that from this <br>verse it is deduced that fasting is made compulsory for every part of the body. Thus, fasting of the tongue means to <br>avoid falsehood, etc. fasting of the ears means not listening to evil, fasting of the eyes means not to look at any <br>form of evil and sirl. Similarly, fasting of the self means to be free from all carnal desires. Fasting of the heart <br>means casting out from it the love of worldly things. Fasting of the mind means avoiding thoughts about anything <br>other than Allah. <br>Our Faults in Ramadan <br>At this point we should ponder over our i'baadah. How much importance do we attach to it in Ramadan? How <br>many nafl do we perform? As for fardh deeds, we observe how numerous people who after having eaten sah'ri get <br>back into bed with the result that the Fajr 'salaah is neglected. Many perform it, but not with Jamaa'ah. It gives the <br>impression that we give thanks to Allah for the food we had eaten for sah'ri by not performing the most important <br>fardh or by not performing it with Jamaa'ah. Such a 'salaah has been termed defective. Rasulullah (SAW) said that, <br>\"There is no 'salaah for those near the musjid except in the musjid\". <br>In the kitaab 'Mazhaahire Haq' we find that there is no reward for the 'salaah for persons who do not perform 'salaah <br>with Jamaa'ah without any valid reason or excuse. <br>Similarly, in numerous cases at the time of if'taar (boeka) Maghrib 'salaah is missed, and many who do not come to <br>the musjid miss the Takbeer at the beginning or miss the first raka'ah. Many people hasten to get over the <br>Taraaweeh 'salaah early and even perform the 'ishaa' 'salaah before the time of 'Ishaa' commences. (Some do not <br>pay any attention to 'salaah even in Ramadan.)<br><br>pay any attention to salaah even in Ramadan.) <br>That is the way we look after our very important fardh 'salaah in Ramadan. Sometimes in the process of performing <br>one fardh, three others are destroyed. How often do we see even the time of Zhuh-r 'salaah going by because we are <br>asleep, while time of A'sr goes by because we are too busy buying, selling or cooking to prepare for if'taar. <br>If such is the case with the faraa'idh, then we can imagine how much less importance is given to the nafl actions. <br>One finds that because of sleep, the time of 'salaatul Ishraaq (after sunrise) and 'salaatul Dhuhaa (before noon) go <br>by.  <br>Then what about 'salaat Awwaabeen (just after Maghrib)? Here we find ourselves busy with If'taar and when <br>thinking about Taraaweeh after about an hour this 'salaah too is wasted. Further we find that for 'salaatul Ta-hajjud <br>the time is the same as that for sah'ri with the result that this too goes by. One may make a thousand excuses for not <br>finding time for these nawaafil. These are all excuses for not performing these 'salaah. <br>We see that there are many who do find the time to do all these 'ibaadahs during these precious moments. I <br>personally had observed my ustaaz Maulana Khalil Ahmad during many a Ramadan. He was a weak sickly person <br><br>and of advanced age but in spite of these drawbacks he used to read one and a quarter juz of the Qur'an in nafl <br>namaaz after Maghrib. Thereafter he used to have meals for about half an hour. After performing all other <br>necessities in preparation for Taraaweeh 'salaah he used to stand in Taraaweeh for about two and a half hours when <br>he was in India, and when he was in Madinah Munawwarah the duration was three hours.  <br>Thereafter he used to sleep about two or three hours (according to the season). Then he used to again recite the <br>Qur\u2019an in Tahajjud 'salaah until about half an hour before Fajr. Then he ate sah'ri. From that time until Fajr he <br>remained busy with reading the Qur\u2019an or reciting of wazifas. With the greyness of dawn he performed Fajr 'salaah, <br>thereafter he remained in meditation (muraa-qabah) until Ishraaq. Having performed Ishraaq he used to write his <br>famous kitaab, 'Baziul Majhood', commentary on Abu Dawood. Then he normally attend to letters and dictating <br>replies up to mid-day. Then he used to rest up to Zhuh-r 'salaah. Between Zhuh-r and A'sr he used to recite the <br>Qur\u2019an. <br>From A'sr Namaaz until Maghrib he used to be busy with tasbeeh and answering the queries of those who visited <br>him. When he completed 'Baziul Majhood' then part of the morning used to be spent in tilaawah and studying some <br>monumental religious works, especially Baziul Majhood and Wafa al Wafa. This was his daily programme for nafl <br>'ibaadah throughout the year.  <br>In Ramadan however, he used to spend a bit more time in his i\u2019baadah, making the rak'aats longer. For the ordinary <br>person to observe the special programmes the other pious elders had for Ramadan would be difficult. Shaikhul <br>Hind Maulana Mahmoo-dul Hasan (Rahmatullah alaihi) used to remain in nafl 'salaah from after Taraaweeh until <br>Fajr, while also listening to the Qur\u2019an recited by various huffaazh one after the other. <br>Maulana Shah Abdurraheem Raipuri (d 1963) remained busy with tilaawah (recitation) of the Qur\u2019an day and night <br>through Ramadan. There used to be no time for attending to correspondence or meeting visitors. Only his special <br>ones were allowed to wait on him after Taraaweeh for a short period while he drank a cup of tea. <br>ADVICE FOR RAMADHAAN <br>The reason for mentioning the manner in which these saintly ones spent their Ramadan is not that we may just read <br>without deriving any benefit or pass a casual remark It is written with the object that we in our way may build up<br><br>without deriving any benefit or pass a casual remark. It is written with the object that we in our way may build up <br>courage and to the best of our ability endeavor to copy and follow their noble examples. Every pious elders <br>programme had its particular specialty. <br>How wonderful would it be if those who are not forced by worldly necessities try their utmost to mend their <br>religious life in this one month after having allowed eleven months of the year go by to destroy themselves. <br>As for those who have to be in their offices and be present at eight, nine or ten in the morning, what difficulty will <br>it be for them if they at least in Ramadan, spend the time from Fajr until their hours of employment in reciting the <br>Qur\u2019an. After all our worldly needs we do find time in spite of office hours. <br>For those engaged in farming, who normally are not bound to others nothing prevents them from reciting the <br>Qur\u2019an on their farm or adjusting their daily routine. Then come the businessmen, shopkeepers and merchants.  <br>Nothing prevents them in Ramadan from reciting their Qur\u2019an during their shop hours or cutting short trading time <br>in order to make time for recitation thereof. After all there is very strong link between Ramadan and the Tilaa-wah <br>of the Qur\u2019an. Almost all Allah's great scriptures were revealed in this month. Similarly, in this month the Qur\u2019an <br><br>was brought down from the Lowhul Mahfoozh to the Samaa'ud Dunyaa, from where it was revealed bit by bit to <br>Rasulullah (SAW) in a span of twenty three years. <br>Nabi Ibrahim (A.S.) received his scriptures on the first and third of this sacred month. Nabi Dawood (A.S.) received <br>the Zaboor on the twelfth or eighteenth. Nabi Moosa (A.S.) received his Towrah on the sixth. Nabi Essa (A.S.) <br>received the Injeel on the twelfth or thirteenth. From this we note the great connection between the divine scriptures <br>and the month of Ramadan.  <br>For this reason, as much ti-laawah of the Qur\u2019an as possible should be made during this month. Such was the habit <br>of our saints. Jibraeel (A.S.) used to recite the whole Qur\u2019an to our Nabi Muhammad (SAW) in the month of <br>Ramadan. In some reports it is stated that Rasulullah (SAW) used to recite and he (Jibraeel) used to listen. From <br>joining these reports the 'ulama have said that it is mustahab to read the Qur\u2019an in such a manner that while one <br>recites the other listens. Thereafter another recites while others listen. So recite the Qur\u2019an as much as possible. <br>Whatever time remains thereafter should not be wasted. <br>Rasulullah (SAW) drew our attention to four more things and advised that we should practice them as much as <br>possible. They are the recitation of Kalimah 'Tayyibah, Istighfaar, begging for Jannah and seeking refuge from Ja-<br>hannam. Therefore it must be regarded an honour to spend as much as available in these recitations. This will be the <br>true appreciation of the teachings of Rasulullah (SAW). What is so difficult about keeping the tongue busy with the <br>recitation of Durood ('salawaat) or  <br>Laa ilaaha illallaah while being engaged in our daily tasks? <br>In the same Hadith Rasulullah (SAW) said a few more things, Ramadan is the month of patience. Hence even if <br>great difficulty is experienced in fasting one should bear it with patience. One should not complain as people are <br>fond of doing during hot days. <br>If by chance sah-ri is missed then lamentations begin early in the day. Similarly, should difficulty be experienced at <br>the same time of Taraaweeh, it too should be borne with patience. Do not consider it a great calamity or trial, <br>otherwise these deeds may be void of blessings. When we turn our backs on worldly things, forsake our very eating <br>and drinking, then in the face of Allah's pleasure what are these difficulties? <br><br>Sympathy for the unfortunate <br>Further, the Hadith states that it is the month of sympathy, especially for the poor and destitute. Sympathy should <br>be of a practical nature. When ten things are placed before us for if'taar, at least two or four of them should be set <br>aside for the poor and needy. In fact they should be treated preferentially, if not then at least equally.  <br>They should certainly be remembered. In showing sympathy for the poor, as in all other matters, the Sahaabah R.A. <br>were living examples, and in this, it is our duty to follow or at least try to follow them. In the matter of sacrifice and <br>sympathy only the courageous can emulate the Sahaabah. There are numerous instances, if they are cited, will only <br>leave one in astonishment. <br>Let us see the following example, Abu Jahm (RA) relates that: \"During the battle of Yarmouk he went in search of <br>his cousins, taking with him a water bag to give him to drink and also wash his wounds if he was found alive or <br>wounded. He found him lying among the wounded. When I asked him whether he wanted some water, he indicated <br>'yes'.  <br><br>At that moment someone near him moaned. My cousin pointed to that person indicating that I should first quench <br>the thirst of the neighbour. I went to him and found that he too needed water, but just as I was about to give him <br>water, a third person groaned near him.  <br>The second one pointed to this third person meaning that I should give the third one to drink first.  <br>I went to the third person but before he could drink, I found out that he had passed away, whereupon I returned to <br>the second one only to find that he too had passed away. When I came to my cousin, he too had become a martyr\". <br>Virtues of I\u2019tikaf <br> <br>I'TIKAAF - SECLUSION IN THE MASJID <br>The meaning of 'I'tikaaf' is to seclude oneself in the Mosque, with the express intention (Niyyat)of 'I'tikaaf'. <br>According to the Hanafi school of thought, this may be of three different types: <br>a) Waajib I'tikaaf (Obligatory I'tikaaf) <br>I'tikaaf becomes compulsory when a person makes it obligatory upon himself. For example, when a person makes a <br>vow to Allah that if Allah fulfils a certain wish of his, he shall perform so many days 'I'tikaaf', in this case, the <br>moment his wish is fulfilled, the I'tikaaf becomes compulsory. Or a person may just make an unconditional vow, <br>whereby he makes I'tikaaf Waajib upon himself for a certain number of days; this becomes obligatory for him from <br>that moment onwards. <br>b) Sunnat I'tikaaf <br>This was the general practice of the Holy Prophet (SAW). It means to seclude oneself in the Masjid for the last ten <br>days of Ramadan. <br>c) Nafl I'tikaaf <br>For the third category i.e. Nafl I'tikaaf, no special time and no specific number of days are fixed. A person may <br>make a Niyyah (intention) for any number of days at any time, even for his whole life. <br><br>While Imaam Abu Hanifa states that I'tikaaf must be for not less than a full day, Imaam Muhammad states that <br>there is no limit as to the minimum period of time. The 'Fatwa'confirms this latter view. Therefore, it is desirable <br>for anyone entering a Masjid to make the 'Niyyah' (intention) of I'tikaaf for the period that he will remain in the <br>Masjid; so that, while he is in Ibaadah, he also earns the reward of I'tikaaf. <br>OBJECTS OF I'TIKAAF AND ITS ADVANTAGES <br>In view of the above, it is advisable that everyone entering the Masjid to join the congregational prayer should, on <br>entering the Masjid, make the Niyyat for 'I'tikaaf', in thatcase it means that aslong as he remain busy with Salaat, <br>Zikr, listening to lectures or sermons he also receive reward for the I'tikaaf. I always observed that my late father <br>used to make 'Niyyat' for I'tikaaf whenever he entered the Masjid. Occasionally, by way of teaching and reminding <br>his followers, he would raise his voice when reciting when reciting the words for 'Niyyah'. The reward for I'tikaaf is <br>great as indicated by the fact that the Holy Prophet (SAW) always used to perform I'tikaaf. The example of him <br>who resides in the Masjid in I'tikaaf is that of a person who, having gone to a certain place to appeal for something, <br>remains there until it is granted. When someone comes begging at our door and then refuses to leave until he has <br>been granted his request. I am sure that even the person with the hardest heart amongst us will eventually give in to <br>his request. How much more Merciful is Allah, and when someone persistently sits at His door, what doubt can <br><br>there be in the fulfilment of his wishes. Allama ibn Qayyim, in explaining the significance of I'tikaaf writes that the <br>actual aim is to divert the heart away from everything except Allah, and to make it come near to Allah, thereby <br>forming a complete spiritual connection with the Creator. All wordly connections are thus cut off, for the sake of <br>gaining Allah's attention and all thoughts, desires, love and devotion become centred around Him. As a result, an <br>attachment with Allah is attained - a love and friendship that will be the only support in loneliness of the grave. One <br>can possibly imagine the great ecstacy with which that time in the grave will be spent. <br>In Maraaiqul Falaah, the author writes that I'tikaaf, when properly and sincerely performed, is among the most <br>virtuous deeds. One cannot possibly enumerate all the great advantages and benefits in it. In actual fact, what takes <br>place in I'tikaaf is that the heart is drawn away from everything else except the Creator, while the soul is actually <br>laidat His door-step. All the time, one remains in a state of 'Ibaadah', even when one is asleep, one is still in His <br>worship striving for nearness to Him. And Allah says (according to a Hadith): \"Whoever draws near to Me (the <br>length of) one hand, then I draw nearer to him (the length of) two hands, and whoever draws near to Me by <br>walking, I draw nearer to him by running.\" Moreover, in I'tikaaf one seeks refuge in the house of Allah, and is safe <br>therein from all enemies. <br>WHERE TO PERFORM I'TIKAAF <br>The best of places for I'tikaaf is the Masjidul Haram in Makkah. <br>The next besi is the Masjidun-Nabawiy in Madinah, and the next best is Baytul Muqaddas. Thereafter, comes the <br>Jaama Masjid in one's own time, and last but not least, the Masjid nearest to one's home. Imaam Abu Hanifa <br>stipulates that the Masjid should be one wherein the five daily Salaatare regularly performed, while Imaam Abu <br>Yusuf and Imaam Muhammad agree that any Masjid acceptable to the Shari'ah can be entered for I'tikaaf. <br>The above applies to the males. As for the females, they should perform It'ikaaf in the prayer room (Masjid set <br>aside in their homes). Where, however, no such demarcated place exists, any one room or part of the house should <br>be set aside for this purpose. I'tikaaf is thus in fact an easier task for women. The domestic duties can be performed <br>by daughters or servants under her supervision and the woman in I'tikaaf, while remaining in a section of her own <br>house, is spiritually rewarded for it. It is so very unfortunate that, in spite of this relative ease, our womenfolk still <br>remain deprived of the blessings of I'tikaaf. <br><br>Virtues of Laylatul Qadr (6&7) <br> <br>HADITH NO. 6 <br>Ubaadah bin Saamit (Radhiallaho anhu) reports that he asked the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) about <br>\"Laylatul Qadr\". He replied: \"It is in Ramadan, during the last ten days, on the unevenly numbered nights, either the <br>21st 23rd, 25th, 27th, 29th or the last night of Ramadan. Whosoever stands in \"Ibaadah\" on this night, with sincere <br>faith and with genuine hopes of gaining reward, his previous sins will be forgiven. Among the signs of this night is <br>that it is a serene, quiet, shining night, neither hot, nor cold but temperate as if a moon is shining clear, and no <br>meteors are shot at the \"Shayateen\" on that night; it lasts until the break of the dawn. Another sign is that at morn, <br>the Sun rises without any radiant beams of light, appearing rather like the moon in it's fullness. On that day, Allah <br>prohibits the \"Shayateen\" from rising up with the Sun.\" <br>COMMENTARY <br>Part of what has been mentioned in this Hadith has already been dealt with. Some signs are here mentioned about <br>the actual night. These signs are clear and need no further elucidation. Apart from these, there are other signs too, <br><br>as mentioned in the Ahadith or in the experiences of those who had the good fortune to experience \"Laylatul Qadr.\" <br>The sign that is, however; most specific in the Hadith is the rising of the sun, 'without any radiant beams of light.' <br>Other signs are not always there. One Sahaabi, Ab'da bin Abi Lubaaba (Radhi Allaho anhu) says: \"On the evening <br>of the 27th , I tasted the water of the sea and it was sweet.\" Ayub bin Khalid said: 'I once had to bathe myself with <br>sea water, and on tasting it, found, it sweet. This was on the 23rd night.\" Some of the \"Mashaaikh\" (religious <br>divines) wrote that, on the evening of \"Laylatul Qadr\", everything prostrates itself before Allah, so much so that <br>trees fall flat on the ground, then return to their normal position; these are however spiritual phenomena not visible <br>to the ordinary person. <br> <br>HADITH NO. 7 <br>Aaisha (RadhiAllaho anha) reports: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), should I find <br>myself the \"Laylatul Qadr\", hat shall I pray. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) replied: say, Allaahumma <br>innaka afuwwun tohibbu al'afwa fa'fu anna \"O Allah, Thou art the One who grants pardon for sins. Thou lovest to <br>pardon, so O pardon me.\" <br>COMMENTARY <br>This is indeed such an all-inclusive prayer, wherein one begs that Allah in His infinite Grace should forgive his <br>sins. If that has been obtained, the path to the Hereafter is secure. What more would one require? Imaam Sufyaan <br>Thowry used to say that to keep oneself busy on this night with 'Du\u2019aa' (invocations to Allah) is better than any <br>other form of worship (Ibaadah). Ibne Rajab says that one should not only remain busy with 'Du\u2019aa', but should <br>also take part in all other form of 'Ibaadah', e.g. recitation of the Holy Qur'an, 'Salaat', contemplation, etc. This <br>latter opinion is most correct and nearer to what Rasulullah (Sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) had said, as already <br>mentioned in the previous Ahaadith.  <br> <br> <br><br> <br><br>Muslim De<br>and its On<br>Translation o<br>Musalmano-ki-Mawjoo<br>Maulana Ihtishaam<br>tran<br>Malik H<br><br>egeneration <br>nly Remedy <br>of the Urdu Book <br>odah-pasti-ka-Waahid-llaaj <br>by <br>mul Hasan Kaandhlawi <br>nslated by <br>Haq Nawaz <br><br>Muslim Degenemtion a<br>AUTHOR'S P<br>For the high devotion, ke<br>Hadhrat Mohammad Ilyas (Ra<br>due to the profound zeal shown<br>pjous personages among Musli<br>rently in progress for the pro<br>Islamic way of life.

It <br>enlightened Muslims and created in them the urge for tak- <br>ing the right counsel, which would ultimately bring them <br>their salvation. By following the right path and the guid- <br>ance emanating from that light, the Muslims moved from <br>success to success and attained the highest pinnacle of <br>glory in history. For centuries, they ruled on this earth with <br>such grandeur and strength that no contemporary power <br>had the courage to challenge them and, if someone dared to <br>do so, he did that at the risk of being annihilated. This is <br>the historical truth, which cannot be-erased. But, alas! this <br>fact of history has only become a myth, an ancient tale, to <br>narrate which may sound meaningless and ridiculous, par- <br>ticularly in the context of the present day life of Muslims, <br>which obviously is a blot on the brilliant performance and <br>achievements of their ancestors, the early followers of <br>Islam. <br>THE DISEASE <br>The history, even up to the end of the thirteenth cen- <br>tury Hijri, will reveal that the Muslims were the sole pos- <br>sessors of honour, dignity, power and grandeur, but when <br>one turns his eyes away from the pages of the history books <br>and looks at the Muslims of today, one sees the picture of a <br>people sunk in misery and disgrace, a people who possess <br>no real strength or power, honour or dignity, brotherhood <br>or mutual love, and reflects no virtues or moral character <br>worth the name. One cannot find any sign in them of those <br>Name of hills around Mecca (Saudi Arabia). <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>noble deeds which at one time used to be the symbol of <br>each and every Muslim. Now-a-days, there can hardly be a <br>living person who can be said to have the purity or the sin- <br>cerity of conscience. On the contrary, Muslims are sunk in <br>vice and sin. They have wandered away so much from the <br>path of virtue which at one time used to be their \"hall- <br>mark\", that the enemies of Islam talk and discuss their <br>affairs with delight, contempt and ridicule. Unfortunately, <br>the matter does not end here. The Muslim youth of the new <br>generation, which has been affected and influenced by the <br>so-called modern trends or the Western way of life, take <br>pleasure in laughing at the very ideals of Islam and openly <br>criticize the sacred code o.f \"Shariat\" as being out of date <br>and impracticable. One wonders at such behaviour and <br>finds that a people, who once gave strength, happiqess, <br>honour and peace to the entire mankind, have now become <br>completely demoralised, apathetic, shallow and helpless. <br>Those who had once taught the world the golden lessons of <br>etiquette and culture are today found wanting in these very <br>adornments. <br>EARLIER ATTEMPTS TOWARDS IMPROVEMENT <br>For a long time, some distinguished thinkers and <br>preachers of Islam have been seriously pondering over this <br>unfortunate plight of their people and have been striving <br>hard to reform the Muslim society, but alas! <br>(The treatment only aggravated the disease). <br>The situation is fast deteriorating and the future looks <br>darker still. Inaction and complacency on our part in these <br>circumstances will be an unforgiveable sin and crime. But, <br>before deciding what is to be done, it will be necessary to <br>I \"  <br>look closely at the root cause of this sad state of affairs. <br>kp$ <br>J a <br>- <br>People have assigned several causes to this degenera- <br>tion and have adopted numerous measures for arresting the l z  <br>rot, but unfortunately all efforts so far have only brought <br>further frustration. Instead of improvement, despair and <br>confusion have resulted, particularly so in the ranks'of <br>learned preachers and \"ulema\". The basic truth of all this <br>is that the root cause of the real disease has not been diag- <br>nosed. Until this is done, no proper treatment can be pre- <br>scribed or administered, hence no cure or improvement <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>can be expected. Any step lacking proper diagnosis and <br>correct treatment would a=ount to making a chronic situa- <br>tion more chronic, and further increase confusion and <br>despair. <br>THE APPROACH <br>It is the proven claim of Islam that the \"Shariat\" is the <br>Divine Code, which lays down a complete way of life out- <br>lining every possible measure for advancing and progress- <br>ing on the path of true success and righteousness. It very <br>clearly describes the proper course of action and indicates <br>methods to check and re-orientate in the event of losing di- <br>rection or going astray. In other words, \"Shariat-e-Muham- <br>madiah\" assures its followers their spiritual and material <br>well-being and advancement for their whole life in all situ- <br>ations, right up to the last day of life on this earth. Ob- <br>viously, therefore, it would be futile to look for the cause <br>and the cure for the prevailing degeneration outside the <br>dictates of \"Shariat\". For this, of necessity, we must look <br>closely into the \"Quran-i-Hakim\" which is the fountain <br>source of \"Shariat\" and of all knowledge and guidance for <br>the whole of mankind. In fact, it is the only source of wis- <br>dom for man. We ought to seek its help in finding out what <br>our troubles are and how they are to be removed, if we <br>really desire to attain full recovery. Once we come to know <br>about that, we must.cling to the solution and solemnly re- <br>solve-to adopt it. Certainly, the wisdom and guidance from <br>the \"Quran\" will never fail us, particularly at the critical <br>juncture and in the difficult times through which we are <br>passing nowadays. Let us look and search for the right sol- <br>ution in the \"Quran\" and \"Sunnah\". <br>THE DIAGNOSIS <br>The Creator of the universe, Allah Ta'ala, remains <br>avowedly  commit^ that the kingdom and His vicegerency <br>on earth are only meant for the true Muslims (momineen). <br>This is clear from the following verse: <br>. . <br>. . <br>(a a ,A\\ <br>) 391 <br>\"Allah has promised to those from amongst you who <br>believe and do righteous deeds that He would surely <br>make them His vicegerents on earth.\" <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>> <br>I <br>I <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>He has also given the assurances that true believers <br>will always dominate over non-believers a d  that non- <br>believers will be left without any friend or ally; as is clear <br>from the following verse: <br>\"And if these non-believers had given you a battle, <br>they were sure to turn on their heels, and they would <br>have found no protector and no helper.\" <br>Moreover, it is Allah Ta'ala's own obligation to grant <br>every help to the true Muslims and it is also His promise <br>that such people will always remain exalted and glorious. <br>This is borne out by the following verses: <br>ctv rJI, <br>@ & d<br>~<br>j<br> <br>.. . <br>(, r, <br>Ji, k$ $ 61 A&YI plj 149 9 j I& <br>~j <br>c 1  ' ' <br>(A d+U\\) &?jd3 +!!j!! <br>\"And it is our bounden duty to render succour to the <br>true be1 ievers. \" <br>\"And do not give way to despair, and do not grieve, <br>and you only shall dominate, if you are true believers.\" <br>\"And honour is only for Allah, His Prophet (sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and those who believe.\" <br>The above Divine assertions clearly indicate that the <br>way to regain honour, grandeur, exaltation, glory and vir- <br>tues by Muslims, lies only in their being strictly faithful. If <br>their relationship with Allah Ta'ala and the Holy Prophet <br>3 , <br>(sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is strong and firm, they are 3 1 <br>destined to be masters of each and every things on this <br>g <br>Earth. But if, on from the following verse: <br>&3 <br>0 <br>, <br>4,g <br>\\ +i <br>: j ) l ~ ] , &  & AUJI 51 4 JiilIj <br>E 8 <br>)4YJ - .  <br>- 3 P J -  - . <br>- - .  <br>.- .- <br>(r - , A, <br>) g<br>k<br> 1993 $\\ <br>4; <br>\"And let Time be witness: verily man is in a great loss <br>except, of course, those who believe and do righteous <br>deeds and who rejoin truth and enjoin patience.\" <br>As already brought out, history proves that the early <br>Muslims had been able to reach the highest summit of <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>honour and glory, whereas the present day Muslims seem <br>to have moved in the opposite direction. It is obvious from <br>the above verses of the Quran that the first Muslims had <br>attained that high position in life because of the purity and <br>strength of their faith and the excellence of their character. <br>Conversely, the deplorable condition of the present-day <br>Muslims is the result of weakness in their faith and charac- <br>ter, the opposite of what their forefathers possessed. There- <br>fore, it will be right to say that today we are Muslims in <br>name only! In this connection, the true Messenger of Allah <br>Ta'ala Hadhrat Mohamrnad, (sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>had prophesied: <br>\"An era will come in the near future when Islam will <br>exist merely in name and Quran will exist merely in <br>phrase.\" : , <br>This is clearly applicable to the Muslims of the present <br>time. In these circumstances, the points which need urgent <br>investigation @re: <br>(a) as the right type of faith, which can have the ap- <br>proval of Allah Ta'ala and His Apostle and which <br>will bring us spiritual and material advancement, <br>is not to be seen anywhere, what will be the means <br>of acquiring that true faith; and <br>(b) what are the factors which have caused the extinc- <br>tion of that faith, and with it the true life of Islam, <br>from our midst? <br>A study of the Holy Quran clearly reveals that the <br>capacity to maintain the required level of the true faith of <br>Islam, and the ultimate ascendance to exaltation and glory <br>through it, are dependent on the fulfilment of a special task <br>which has been so graciously assigned by Allah Ta'ala to <br>the Muslims alone. It is for this that they have been given, <br>in the Quran, the distinguished position, \"Khair-ul-Umam\" <br>(the best of dl peoples). <br>According to the faith of Islam, the main purpose <br>behind the creation of this world was to establish and <br>prove the Divinity, the Oneness, and the most exalted <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>existence of Almighty Allah Ta'ala, and to reflect His un- <br>limited Powers and boundless Attributes through man, <br>who was to be guided by the light of true knowledge. It was <br>impossible for man to conceive and utilize that knowledge <br>without his first being purified of impiety and obscenity. <br>Only after that purification, is he to be adorned with fine <br>virtues, excellence of conduct and the eventual capacity to <br>act righteously. It was for this purpose of bringing about <br>this purity and power in the ranks of mankind that thou- <br>sands of Prophets and Apostles had been deputed by Allah <br>Ta'ala. The last in the series, came the \"Sayyed-ul-Ambia <br>wal Mursalin\" (the greatest of all the Prophets) Mohammsd <br>(sallallaho alaihe wasallam). It was through him that man <br>reached the high state of development of mind and body <br>leading to the final stage of purity. It was then that man- <br>kind received the glad tidings in the following verse: <br>\"And today we have perfected your Religion for you <br>and completed our bounty upon you.\" <br>The supreme purpose of man's creation had been ful- <br>filled; good and evil had been clearly defined, a complete <br>system of practical life had been revealed, the lineage of <br>prophethood and apostlehood had been terminated, and <br>lastely, the duties that were formerly discharged exc!us- <br>ively by the Prophets had devolved as a collective mission <br>upon the \"Ummat-i-Mohammadia\" (the Muslim people). <br>h <br>This last fact has been clearly brought out in the following 3 1 <br>verses of the Holy Quran: <br>et E <br>&,h <br>' <br>I. <br>6 8 <br>I <br>@ A*j <br>d,+j& A,pj &Q< <br>g\\ + @ <br>BY <br>.I .I <br>. - <br>z* <br>d <br>(\\ \\ . OI+ <br>Jr ) +lJ& <br>&,L$j <br>E a <br>\"0 you (followers of Mohammad): you are the noblest <br>of peoples, in that you have been brought out for (the <br>benefit of) mankind. You enjoin the good and forbid <br>the evil, and you believe in Allah.\" <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>\"And it is but meet that amongst you there should be a <br>group devoted to inviting people towards righteous- <br>ness and enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, <br>and it is only those who do this that prosper.\" <br>In the first verse, \"Allah Ta'ala\" has stated the reason <br>why the Muslims are called \"Khair-ul-Umam\" (noblest of <br>all peoples); it is because of spreading good and preventing <br>evil. In the second verse, He has further clarified that only <br>those people shall be exalted in life who fulfil that injunc- <br>tion. The command does not end here. It is stated in an- <br>other place that the failure to accomplish this vital task <br>will bring curse and gloom on its assignees. This inference <br>is taken from the following verse: <br>\"And those amongst the people of Israel who rejected <br>Allah's commands were cursed by Allah through the <br>tongues of Dawood and Isa, son of Mariam. And the <br>curse was because they rebelled against Allah's com- <br>mands and transgressed the limits and did not desist <br>from the evil that they were doing; and verily it was a <br>grievous lapse on their part.\" <br>A further explanation and clarification of the above <br>verse of the Holy Quran can be seen from the following <br>\"Ahadis\" (sayings of the Holy Prophet Mohammad (sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>(1) It has been narrated by Hadhrat Abdullah bin Ma- <br>sud (radi Allaho anho) that the Holy Prophet (sallallaho <br>alaihe wasailam) was pleased to say: <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>-. ,. <br>J'J J'J a<br>,<br> <br>a &I A+ <br>p &I, <br>+JI dj (\\) <br>J<br>.<br> <br>@, <br>& <br>$ > J! :&j & ~1 <br>hl iGj <br>\"Amongst peoples gone by, when somebody com- <br>mitted a sin, the other would reprimand him and <br>would say: \"Fear Allah\"; but on the following day <br>would befriend him and mix with him as if he had <br>never seen him committing the sin. And when Allah <br>saw them behaving thus, He confounded the hearts of <br>some with those of some, and cursed them through the <br>tongues of Dawood and Isa son of Mariam; and this bc- <br>cause they rebelled against Allah and transgressed His <br>limits.\" <br>I, Mohammad swear by Him, Who has control over my <br>soul: you must enjoin the good and forbid the evil and <br>force the ignorant wrongdoer into the path of rectitude; else <br>Allah will confound your hearts and you will be cursed, as <br>were some of the peoples gone by. <br>'<br>S<br>I I <br>Yj <br>& I <br>& j <br>4 5 <br>3 \"  <br>. <br>.\" <br>- <br>E 8  <br>$<br>f<br> r; <br>g <br>(2) Hadhrat JAreer (radi Allaho anho) has narrated that <br>Hadhrat Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>pleased to say: \"When an individual of a community sins, <br>and the community, in spite of its authority over him, does <br>not prevent him from sinning, Allah's punishment de- <br>scends on them even before death, i.e., He subjects them to <br>various tribulations in this very world.\" <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>(3) Hadhrat Anas (radi Allaho anho] has narrated that <br>Hadhrat Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was pleased <br>to say, \"The Kalimah La ilaha Illallaho al~ays~benefits <br>the in- <br>dividuals who proclaim it, and keeps away from them woes <br>and troubles, unless, indeed, its rights are ignored.\" The com- <br>panions inquired: \"What does the ignoring of its rights <br>mean?\" Replied the Prophet: \"It means that when sins are be- <br>ing committed openly they do not prevent or stop them.\" <br>(4) Hadhrat Aisha (radi Allaho anha) says: \"The Holy <br>Prophet, (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to me and I could <br>read from his noble countenance that something extraordinary <br>had happened. He did not utter a single word but, having per- <br>formed ablution, repaired straight to the mosque. I, too, stood <br>by the wall of the mosque to hear what he had to say. The <br>Prophet of Allah ascended the pulpit and, after the usual holy <br>exordium, said: '0 <br>people, Allah has ordained you to enjoin <br>the good and forbid the evil, lest a time should come when <br>you call and He may not respond, you ask for a favour and He <br>may not grant it, and you call for help and He may refuse'.\" <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>(5) Hadhrat Abu Huraira (radi Allaho anho) has narrated: <br>\"Said the Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam): When my <br>\"Ummat\" (followers) begin to attach more importance to <br>the world and to regard it as a source of glory, the awe <br>and importance of Islam will vanish from their hearts. <br>When they give up the practice of enjoining good and for- <br>bidding evil, they will be deprived of the blessings of <br>Revelation, and, when they begin to indulge in mutual <br>recrimination, they will fall low in the eyes of Allah.\" <br>THE ROOT-CAUSE <br>From the above \"Ahadis\" it is clear, that the abandon- <br>ment of the act of \"Amir bil maruf wa nahi anil munkar\" (en- <br>joining the good and forbidding the evil) has usually been the <br>root cause of \"Allah Ta'ala's\" anger and displeasure and His <br>eventual wrath. And if the \"Ummat-e-Mohammadiah\" be- <br>comes guilty of that neglect and omission, the punishment to <br>he given to them will be more severe than to the earlier <br>people, because they would have failed to recognise their ex- <br>clusive obligation and neglected to fulfil the sole mission in <br>their life. For this reason, the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has enjoined the act of \"Amir bil maruf wa nahi <br>anil munkar\" (enjoining the good and forbidding the evil) \"as <br>the essence and the pivot of the faith of Islam\" and the aban- <br>donment of that act as the cause of decay and decline of the <br>faith. <br>In the \"Hadis\" of Abu Saeed Khudri, (radi Allaho anho) it <br>is mentioned: <br>8 h <br>.J% <br>2 E <br>\"When anyone of you witnesses the commission of evil, <br>he should use his hands to prevent it; and if he has not <br>the power to do this, he should use his tongue; and if he <br>has not the power to do even this, he should use the pow- <br>er of his heart; and this last represents the weakest degree <br>of faith.\" <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>There is yet a clearer version of the same \"Hadis\" from <br>Ibne Masud (radi Allaho anho): <br>It is usual for Allah to so arrange that every Prophet <br>leaves behind a group of his companions who perpet- <br>uate His message, who follow it rigorously and pre- <br>serve the holy message exactly in the form in which <br>the Messenger left it. Then comes an epoch of mischief <br>and error, an epoch that witnesses the birth of people <br>who step aside from the path laid down by the <br>Prophet. Their actions are at variance with their proc- <br>lamations; their activities are not warranted by the <br>holy law. So whosoever arises in defence of Truth and <br>Law, and opposes the miscreants with his hands, is a <br>true believer; he who cannot do this but uses his <br>tongue, is a believer too; and he who cannot, do even <br>this, but uses the power of his heart, is also a believer; <br>but less than this, there is no degree of faith-(Muslim). <br>The vital importance of Tabligh (the task of propaga- <br>tion] has been further emphasized by Imam Ghazali, (rah- <br>matullah alaih) in the following manner: <br>\"There can be no doubt that the act of \"amr bil maruf <br>wa nahi anil munkar\" is that solid pillar of Islam, on <br>which each and every article of faith rests. It is for this <br>very mission that Allah Ta'ala deputed all the Holy <br>Prophets. If unfortunately, it is ignored or forgotten <br>and its methods and practices are given up, one has to <br>say that the very purpose of prophethood is totally <br>defeated and rendered meaningless. Thereafter, the <br>conscience, which is the capital wealth of man, will <br>wither and degenerate. Indolence and dullness of mind <br>will prevail. The highway to vice and arrogance will be <br>opened up and barbarity will spread in the whole <br>world. All achievements of man will become danger- <br>ous and even harmful. Human relationship will break <br>I <br>I <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>down. Civilization will be ruined. Mankind will be <br>reduced to utter moral destitution. But, the vivid <br>realisation of all this will come only on the Day of <br>Judgement, when the entire mankind will be under <br>trial before the Almighty Allah Ta'ala and called upon <br>to'account for each and every action.\" <br>\"Alas! alas! the fear has come true, that which was <br>apprehended is before our eyes. <br>The tower of knowledge and enlightenment has been <br>demolished and its benefits and effects have been com- <br>pletely wiped out. Consequently, mutual contempt and <br>humiliation are rampant. Nothing, of the sublime relation- <br>ship between man and his Creator, is left in human hearts; <br>on the contrary, man, like an animal, has become the slave <br>of his passions. Indeed, not only is there a paucity of true <br>Muslims in this world now, but it is practically impossible <br>to meet anyone who is prepared to bear the inevitable pri- <br>vations for the sake of propagating Islam. <br>\"Any Muslim who dares to take steps to remove the <br>present state of ruin and devastation, endeavours to revive <br>the act of propagation and comes forward to shoulder that <br>heavy responsibility, will surely rank as the noblest and <br>the most distinguished being among the whole of man- <br>kind.\" <br>He said this nearly eight hundred years ago, but his <br>statement is very accurately applicable to us today. <br>C <br>*= - <br>We must ponder and calmly think out what is to be <br>6 $ <br>done in these circumstances. There are some well-known <br>%& <br>causes which seem to be responsible for the apathy and in- <br>,g 5 <br>difference that prevail today. These are discussed below. <br>E 3 <br>.- .- <br>- <br>-a <br>5 s <br>CAUSES <br>FIRST <br>We generally believe that the act of Tabligh is the sole <br>and special responsibility of the \"ulema\", even when the <br>relevant injunctions of the Quran are clear and squarely <br>apply to each and every living Muslim. The actions and the <br>hard work of the Companions of the Holy Prophet (sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam), and all those distinguished Muslims <br>who immediately followed them, bear definite testimony to <br>the contention that each and every Muslim is responsible <br>for the propagation of Islam (Tabligh). <br>'I'o assign the obligation of 'l'abligh (amr bil maruf wa <br>nahi anil munkar) solely to the ranks of \"ulema\", and not <br>to ourselves, is a sign of grave ignorance on our part. The <br>duty of the \"ulema\" is to state the truth and to point out <br>the right path. To enforce the righteousness among the <br>people and to keep the people moving on the right path is <br>the responsibility of all other Muslims. The following <br>\"Hadis\" is a clear exhortation to this: <br>' I J  <br>J I J  <br>tIj 3~~ & &,$I >$J , &j <br>. - 9 i& pj tlj p 91 <br>'<br>I<br> <br>L <br>t $% 2% $j - a *  <br>@ tlj &jjlj ' @ J& $j +$ <br>' <br>J.. <br>t' <br>Jb&cIjA$Ij <br><<br>~<br>d<br>&<br>~<br>j<br>f<br>J<br>j<br>j<br>~<br>~<br>&<br>~<br>l<br> if\"^ <br>' I '  <br>' I '  <br>.* j *$j <br>- ~ , b ] .  <br>+j - -  3 >& pj <br>tlj @ ' i+$j <br>eu ,.- <br>\"Lo! All of you are leaders and shall be questioned on <br>the Day of Judgment in respect of your trust. So, the <br>king is a head unto his subjects and shall be ques- <br>tioned in respect of them; the husband is a head unto <br>his wife and shall be questioned in respect of her; the <br>wife is a head unto her husband's house and the r:hil- <br>dren, and shall be questioned in respect of them all: <br>the slave is a watchman unto his master's effects and <br>shall be questioned in respect of those. So you are all <br>shepherds, and you shall be questioned in respect of <br>that entrusted to you.\" <br>I i<br>I <br>I<br>I <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>And similarly, in another place, a yet clearer version is <br>given: <br>The Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"Religion is the act of counselling.\" (The Companions) <br> <br>enquired: \"On whose part (to counsel)?\" He said: \"On <br>the part of Allah, the Apostle, the leaders of the Mus- <br>lims and the lay Muslims.\" <br>Even if we suppose, as an extreme case, that this task <br>has to be carried out by the \"Ulema\" only, the present <br>emergency and the critical situation demand that everyone <br>of us should put his shoulder to the wheel and strive hard <br>for the propagation of the \"Kalimah\" and the protection of <br>theMuslim way of life. <br>SECOND <br> <br>It is commonly believed that, if a person is firm and <br>steadfast in his own faith (eeman), the infidelity of others <br>will bring him no harm, because of the meaning attached to <br>the following verse of Holy Quran: <br>\"0 you who believe! you are responsible for your own <br>souls. He who goes astray cannot harm you, while you <br>are on the path of righteousness.\" <br>g s% <br>In fact, the real meaning and sense of the above verse <br>is not what is being apparently attached to it, because, in <br>~2 <br>that case, the meaning would appear to be against the Div- <br>-2 g <br>ine wisdom and spirit and against the teachings of the <br>.8.2 <br>- <br>\"Shariat-i-Mohammadiah.\" It indicates that the collective <br>* w  <br>life and progress and salvation of the Muslim society as a 5 z <br>whole are the essence of Islam. The Muslim people must be <br>considered like a single body having several limbs. When <br>any limb receives an injury, the whole body suffers from <br>the pain. <br>Mankind may progress to any limit and it may reach <br>the highest pinnacle of glory in every sphere of life, yet <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>there will be some who will go astray and become involved <br>in impiety. In that event, the above verse re-assures the <br>righteous people that as long as they remain steadfast and <br>keep moving on the right path, no harm can be brought to <br>them by those who decide to give up the right way of life. <br>Yet another point is that full enlightenment will be <br>received only when all the rules of law of \"Shariat-i- <br>Mohammadiah\" are accepted and practised, including all <br>the Divine commands, which naturally cover \"Amir bil <br>maruf wa nahi anil munkar\". This interpretation is sup- <br>ported by the following words of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (radi <br>Allaho anho): <br>\"0 people! you are given to reading this verse: \"0 you <br>who believe! you are responsible for your own souls; <br>he who goes astray cannot harm you, while you are on <br>the path of righteousness,\" but I have heard the <br>Apostle of Allah saying that when people see some- <br>thing evil and do not seek to liquidate it, they will <br>soon find themselves encompassed by the wrath of <br>Allah.\" <br>The verse in question has been similarly interpreted by <br>all the truly learned personages, such as Imam Nawdvi <br>(rahmat-ullah alaih), who explains in his \"Sharah Mus- <br>lim\": <br>\"The consensus of opinion of the learned personages <br>regarding the meaning of his verse is that, \"when you <br>have performed the duty enjoined on you, the remiss- <br>ness of those who refuse to profit by your counsel will <br>not harm you,\" as says Allah Ta'ala: <br>\"(No one shall carry another man's burden)\"; and of <br>the several injunctions addressed to all, one is that <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>regarding enforcement of good and prevention of evil. <br>Therefore when an individual has performed this duty. <br>and the addressee proves refractory, the former shall <br>not be penalised for it. He has performed his duty of <br>\"amr-o-nahi\" and acceptance or rejection of it by the <br>other party is not within his competence. Allah knows <br>best.\" <br>THIRD <br>People of distinction as well as the common man, the <br>learned and the ignorant, all alike, have become indifferent <br>or even averse to the need for the reformation of society. <br>They all seem to have resigned to the fate, that it is diffi- <br>cult, rather impossible these days, for the Muslims to make <br>any progress to regain their lost glory. Whenever any <br>scheme for improvement and reformation is presented to <br>anyone, the usual reaction is: how can the Muslims pro- <br>gress in the circumstances when they have neither a state* <br>of their own nor any power to rule, neither wealth nor any <br>financial standing, no army and equipment of war nor any <br>influence, they lack even in physical stamina, mutual <br>agreement and unity of purpose. Even the religious people <br>seem to have decided by themselves that, it being the four- <br>teenth century \"Hijri\" and the people, having drifted so <br>farther away from the prophetical teachings, the downfall <br>of Islam and the Muslims is inevitable. They maintain that. <br>in these circumstances, it will be useless to make any effort <br>towards the reformation of Muslims. <br>It is true that the effects of the apostolic light become <br>less and less as we are removed farther and farther away <br>_ <br>from it, but this does not mean that no effort is to be made <br>,E <br>to regenerate that light by enforcing \"Shariat\" and uphold- <br>2 E <br>ing and defending, with all our energies and power, the <br>way of life taught by Hadhrat Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe <br>o&f <br>was all am^. <br>E Y <br>.- -- <br>a <br>For; had the Muslims before us thought so, there <br>m u  <br>would have been no trace of Islam left anywhere by now, g ii <br>because there would have been no means through which <br>the lessons and the teachings of \"Shariat\" could have <br>reached us. Therefore, it will be fatal for us not to check the <br>' The original text was written in 1938 when the Muslilns of th; Indian sub- <br>continent were 11ot frec! and did 11ot possoss indcperldci~t politic:al powc:r clr <br>authority. <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>present negative attitude towards Islam. We should adopt a <br>vi orously positive line for our own sake and also for the <br>f <br>sa e of future generations. The time is moving fast, and so <br>is the pace of deterioration in the religion of Islam. The <br>situation demands a strong, quick and determined effort by <br>one and all for arresting the rot and stopping further degen- <br>eration of the Muslim society. <br>As a rule, existence of true Islam depends entirely <br>upon the perseverance and collective effort of its followers. <br>Unfortunately, they seem to be deficient in these very re- <br>quirements. We must appreciate that the \"Quran\" and <br>\"Hadis\" are full of the lessons in calling the Muslims to be <br>active and to persevere in the path of Allah. There is a <br>\"hadis\" about a very pious person who may pray night and <br>day all his life, but he cannot come to the level of one who <br>strives and sacrifies his pleasure and comfort for the sake <br>of guiding and helping people to move on the right path of <br>Islam. <br>On this very point, many commands and injunctions <br>in the \"Quran\" exist. It is clearly brought out that the one <br>who strives hard in the path of Allah Ta'ala remains <br>superior and exalted compared to all other; for example: <br>\"The believers who, without a reasonable excuse, sit at <br>home, cannot equal those who perform \"jehad\" in the <br>path of Allah with their lives and wealth. Allah has <br>raised the status of those who perform \"jehad\" with <br>their lives and wealth as compared to those who stay <br>at home. To the former, He has promised a blessed <br>abode; Allah has exalted the \"Mujahideen\" over those <br>who stay at home, with glorious reward: pompous <br>ranks, His mercy and forgiveness; and Allah is For- <br>giving and Merciful.\" <br>Although the above verse refers to \"jehad\" (holy war) <br>against the infidels and unbelievers in order to uphold the <br>teachings of Islam and subdue and subjugate faithlessness <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>and \"shirk\" and, although we are unfortunate in not having <br>the opportunity of fulfilling that sublime task, we ought not <br>to throw away any chance of doing something, howsoever <br>small, in the direction of propagating the truth. Only then <br>can we expect that one day our humble efforts and insig- <br>nificant perseverance may gather momentum and impetus <br>for bigger and higher performances. <br>Undoubtedly Allah Ta'ala has promised to provide <br>rotection for the way of life propagated by Hadhrat Mo- <br>Eammad (sallallaho alaihe wasallam). But, human effort <br>and perseverance have been defined as the only media for <br>its promotion and advancement. The Companions of the <br>Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) strove untiringly <br>for that purpose and, assuredly, they succeeded and were <br>the recipients of high rewards. They had the honour of re- <br>ceiving Divine help and assistance. We, being their admir- <br>ers and believers, ought to try and follow them and prepare <br>ourselves for the propagation of the \"Kalimah\" and the <br>message of Allah Ta'ala. Thus, we will also be favoured <br>with Divine help and assistance: <br>\"If you (come forward to) help the religion of Allah <br>Ta'ala, He shall help you and make you steadfast.\" <br>FOURTH <br>Most of us think that, as we ourselves do not possess <br>the essential virtues and qualities of Islam, we are not com- <br>5 , <br>petent to perform the duty of propagation of those qualities <br>F <br>e E <br>among others. This is a clear misunderstanding. Since an <br>obligation has to be fulfilled, particularly when we have <br>,e, <br>been commanded by Allah Ta'ala for that task, there can be <br>8 5 <br>no question of denying obedience to it. We must set our- <br>.g .2 <br>- <br>selves to work in obedience to Divine command. Our ef- <br>@<br>-<br> <br>forts then shall. \"Insha Allah\", gather greater strength and <br>make us more determined and resolute. In this way, our <br>sustained endeavour on proper lines will one day bring us <br>the great honour of being dear to Allah Ta'ala. It id against <br>the convention and the Sunnat of Allah Ta'ala that, if one <br>perseveres and strives for His sake (religion), He would not <br>condescend to bestow favours and kindnesses because the <br><br>2 2 <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>person was not competent or fit for the task! This point is <br>fully brought out in the following Hadis: <br>Hadhrat Anas (radiallaho anho) relates: \"We inquired <br>of the Holy Prophet: '0 Prophet of Allah, is it right that <br>we should not enjoin virtue unless we practise all the <br>virtues ourselves, and should not forbid the wrongs <br>unless we ourselves completely abstain from them all? <br>'Nay,' said the Prophet, 'do enjoin others to practise <br>good deeds even though you do not practise all of <br>them, and do forbid evil actions even though you do <br>not abstain from them all'.\" <br>FIFTH <br>Most of us take it for granted that the religious schools, <br>the \"Ulema\", the saints who have their seats at various <br>religious places (Khanqah), and the religious books and <br>magazines are sufficient activities for the fulfilment of the <br>mission of \"Amr bil ma'ruf wa nahi anil munkar\" (Tab- <br>ligh). These efforts, they think, are enough to meet the re- <br>quirements of Tabligh. Undoubtedly, the presence of 'a11 <br>these is absolutely essential and one must 1ook.upon them <br>with reverence and pay attention to their problems, as the <br>traces of Islam that exist today owe their existence to these <br>very institutions, but they are not enough to meet the situa- <br>tion even partially. The task is stupenduous, considering <br>our present weaknesses and the extent of the problem. To <br>be content with the existence of these few means will be a <br>grave folly on our part. <br>Even to derive full benefit from these institutions, we <br>have to create, within ourselves, a true and a deep respect <br>for the faith of Islam and a burning desire to adopt it in our <br>practical life. Up to fifty years back, people did possess real <br>love, urge and passion for Islam, and there were visible <br>signs and manifestations of Islamic way of life. In those <br>days these institutions could perhaps meet the demand <br>!<br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>2 3 <br>I <br>adequately. But, today all our sentiments and feelings for <br>Islam are practically dead, because of the continuous on- <br>slaught on our faith and social structure by various foreign <br>elements and forces. Alas! they have succeeded in their <br>object! As, instead of love, we seem to possess a hidden <br>inferiority complex towards our religion and faith! <br>Obviously, therefore, we must act quickly and wrest the <br>initiative from the hands of opposite forces and launch a <br>strong counter-effort, whereby we are able to revive the <br>dead spirit of each and every Muslim and rekindle in him <br>the love and attachment for Islam. Only then can we derive <br>full benefit from the existing religious institutions which, <br>in turn, can serve the community in a befitting manner. <br>Unless such steps are taken vigorously, the present state of <br>complacency will spread deep and wide, and instead of <br>these institutions, which are doing good in this limited <br>way, may meet the fate of total extinction. <br>SlXTH <br>There is a great misunderstanding that, whenever one <br>takes up the work of enjoining good and forbidding evil, he <br>is not received well by the people. The people invariably <br>treat him badly, using harsh and insulting language. Also, <br>that sometimes people tend to adopt a mean and contemp- <br>! <br>tuous attitude towards religious workers. This is true, but <br>we are apt to forget the fact that the performance of the act <br>of propagation means simply to follow in the footsteps of <br>the Prophets of Allah Ta'ala, who were always the victims <br>of the worst type of treatment. That is the usual and des- <br>tined disposition of those who take to this mission! Indeed, <br>all Prophets had to suffer untold miseries on account of <br>this, as is clear from the following verse: <br>S h <br>~2 <br>-<br> = <br>r. <br>e E <br>I <br>I <br>8% <br>8' <br>f <br>(, . +I) <br>. &jj&i <br>u 0 <br>E Y  <br>.I .- <br>\"And We sent down Prophets before you amongst 4; <br>people gone by, and no Prophet came to them but that <br>they ridiculed him.\" <br>The Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once re- <br>marked: <br>\"No Prophet has suffered more than me in the propa- <br>gation of truth.\" <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>It is obvious therefore that there is no justification for <br>giving rise to such misunderstanding. As we profess to be <br>the followers of Hadhrat Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) who himself had suffered in the performance of <br>this very mission, but took everything cheerfully and with <br>forbearance, we must also follow his sublime examples and <br>show patience and calmness while performing the vital <br>duty of \"Tabligh\". <br>SOLUTION <br>It has been clearly brought out in the preceding pages <br>that the current disease in the body of Muslims has sprung <br>from the extinction of the true spirit of Islam in our hearts. <br>As a result, real sentiments and love for Islam are practical- <br>ly dead in us and our belief in it has dissipated. Obviously, <br>when the very source becomes dry, the channels of virtue, <br>good deeds and fine attributes, which can flow from it, are <br>not to be seen any longer. This is exactly what is evident <br>today. It has been fully discussed and brought out earlier <br>that the only means for the building up of this source, and <br>maintining a constantly roper flow of religious benefits <br>E <br>from it, is the act of \"Ta ligh\", which really and truly is <br>the life-blood, of Islam. Unless we are able to revive it, we <br>cannot achieve anything in this life because no nation or <br>people can rise to glory without having in them the high <br>human attributes and character which only the religion of <br>Islam can give. <br>We should now clearly feel the disease from which we <br>suffer and judge the treatment which can bring the remedy. <br>It is now up to us to set about the revival of the obligatory <br>task of \"Tabligh\". It will be only then that we can hope to <br>regenerate the true faith of Islam in the masses. By this <br>means alone can we recognise and truly understand both <br>Allah Ta'ala and His Holy Prophet, Hadhrat Mohammad <br>(sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and will be able to clearly <br>understand and finally submit to their commands and <br>wishes. To achieve all this, we will have to adopt the exact <br>methods and ways which are laid down and were demon- <br>strated by the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself when he reformed the pagan Arabs. Allah Ta'ala <br>says in the Quran: <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>\"Indeed the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>is the perfect example for you to follow.\" <br>In this very connection, Hadhrat Imam Malik (rahma- <br>tullah alaihi) said: <br>'. <br>dji <br>ligjz91 ?&?T&& <br>Reformation of the last (part) of this (Mohammad's) Ummat <br>will not be possible except by adopting the method which <br>was used in the beginning (by Hadhrat Mohammad sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>In the beginning, when the Holy Prophet (sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) had started to call the people to Islam, he <br>did not have a single supporter behind him nor had he any <br>political power or possessions. The Pagan Arabs were arro- <br>gantly independent and self-opinionated. No one among <br>them was prepared to listen to reason or truth or obey <br>another person. They strongly disliked and were deadly <br>opposed to the \"Kalimah-tul-Haq\", which the Holy Prophet <br>(sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had the sole mission to teach. <br>In these circumstances, one wonders what gave such invis- <br>ible power and force to that one single man, who was <br>wordly poor and without any means, that he eventually <br>was able to draw the whole of the Arab nation towards <br>him. First we ought to carefully think and see what was it <br>towards which he beckoned the people; initially they <br>refused, but came running towards him as soon as they per- <br>ceived the light, and stood by him so close that they never <br>left him again. It was the message of Eternal Truth to which <br>he called!-that and only that (Truth), which was the Holy <br>Prophet's (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sole mission and aim <br>in life-and <br>which he so beautifully presented to the <br>people! It is: <br>( 7  d<br>l<br> <br>J )  . 1 <br>4, <br>.g 1 <br>\"That we worship nothing but Allah, and associate g! <br>none with Him as His compeer or rival, and none of us <br>considers another god except Allah.\" <br>The propagation of that same very truth can bring the <br>very same results again. <br>The Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) forbade <br>his followers from looking upon any 'Being' except Allah <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>Ta'ala for worship or obedience. Not only did he succeed <br>in achieving his aim, but was able to cut all ties between <br>his followers and every alien element, and bound his <br>people in one uniform system of life from which they never <br>tried to break away again. They really became the picture <br>of: <br>\"Follow that which has been sent to you from the Sus- <br>tainer, and do not follow others (considering them) as <br>Protectors except Allah Ta'ala.\" <br>This was the real lesson, which the Ho!y Prophet (sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) had been commanded (by Allah <br>Ta'ala) to teach and spread. It is further clear from the fol- <br>lowing verse: <br>\"0 Muhammad! invite people to your Lord with wis- <br>dom and better counsel, and argue with them in such <br>wise as ,is best; verily your Lord knows the one who <br>wanders' astray from His path, and He knows those <br>who are bn the right path.\" <br>The highway marked for the progress of the Holy <br>Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and .his followers is <br>further declared in the following verses: <br>\"0 <br>Muhammad! say, this is my path, and I invite you <br>towards Allah Ta'ala knowingly, I and my followers <br>too: and Allah is all pure and never will I join partners <br>with Allah.\" <br>I <br>\"And who is better in speech than one who invites you <br>towards Allah Ta'ala, does good deeds and says, verily, <br>I am of those who submit their will to Allah.\" <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>2 7 <br>To call mankind to Allah Ta'ala and show the right <br>path to all those who had gone astray was the only mission <br>and the sole purpose of the Holy Prophet's (sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) life. To serve this very purpose, thou- <br>sands of prophets had been deputed before him. As Allah <br>Ta'ala says: <br>\"And We did not send any Prophet before you, but <br>that We revealed upon him that verily there is no god <br>but Me and so worship Me.\" <br>The sacred biography of Hadhrat Mohammad (sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) and also those of other Prophets indi- <br>cate one single aim as the sole mission of their lives: i.e., to <br>believe in One True Allah Ta'ala and His one Divine Per- <br>sonality and His Attributes. This belief is the essence of the <br>faith of Islam. It was to practise and demonstrate this very <br>faith that man has been sent on this earth, as will be seen <br>from this verse: <br>\"And We have not created the genii and human beings <br>but to worship Me only.\" <br>We should by now ought to be able to understand the <br>real purpose for the creation of man and the way we, par- <br>5 h <br>ticularly Muslims, should live; we also know the true dis- <br>3 T  <br>ease from which we suffer and its treatment; it should, <br>therefore, not be difficult then to find out how to apply that <br>8h-h <br>treatment and regain our lost vitality. If we bear in our <br>4 5 <br>mind all that has been discussed so far, and with that back- <br>.g <br>ground act sincerely, any method adopted will \"Insha <br>,$ J <br>Allah\" prove to be beneficial and successful. However, a <br>proven successful method is described. <br><br>COURSE OF ACTION <br>With the very limited knowledge and understanding <br>that I have about such a vital matter as \"Tabligh\" (enjoin- <br>ing good and forbidding evil), a scheme of work and action <br>is described below, for the improvement of Muslims and <br>their progress in Islam. Actually, what I have to say is <br>nothing else than a brief outline of the practical way of life <br>which had been followed by our ancestors and early <br>Muslims. <br>The FIRST and the FOREMOST thing to do is to <br>change the aim of our life, from material motives and ac- <br>quisition of .wealth, to the propagation and spreading of Al- <br>lah Ta'ala's \"Kalimah\" and Islam; to fix as a definite objec- <br>tive for ourselves, the enforcement of the commands and <br>orders of Allah Ta'ala; and to sincerely resolve: I will obey <br>every command of Allah Ta'ala, shall try to practise it in <br>my dgily life and will not disobey Allah Ta'ala in any cir- <br>cumstances. The fulfilment of this resolution must be made <br>the main aim of life. We can plan and act on this broad <br>base by adopting the following practical scheme and pro- <br>cedure: <br>(1) To memorise and correctly recite the \"Kalimah\": <br>And to understand its literal meaning, as well as what <br>it actually implies. <br>That is, to believe, to say, and to act on the faith that <br>Allah Ta'ala is the only Power, the onlv Authority and the <br>Sale Controller of all things, and it is He alone who is to be <br>worshipped and obeyed, and it is He alone who grants suc- <br>cess or failure in life. Success will depend on our truly <br>adopting the way of life preached and taught by Hadhrat <br>Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and our accepting <br>him as true and last Prophet of Allah. <br>Having this as ideal, we begin to change our own life <br>on the pattern requirements of the \"Kalimah\". <br>(2) To become punctual and regular in offering our <br>prayers (naniaz) five times a day. The performance of this <br>most obligatory duty ought to be strictly in accordance <br>with the procedure laid down by Hadhrat Mohammad (sal- <br>7<br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), to be periormed in utmost humil- <br>ity and supplication. The greatness and superiority of <br>Allah Ta'ala must be held uppermost in mind throughout <br>the prayers, whilst maintaining the feelings of one's own <br>humbleness and helplessness. In other words, \"namaz\" <br>should be performed as if one was actually being presented <br>to Allah Ta'ala in a manner befitting the Height of His <br>Greatness and Glory. If the procedure of \"namaz\" is not <br>known, it ought to be learnt properly with each detail com- <br>mitted to memory. <br>(3) To develop attachment of body and soul to the Holy <br>Quran in the following manner: <br>(a) To recite daily a portion of the Quran, however <br>small, with highest respect and reverence for the <br>holy scripture and by understanding its meaning, <br>if possible. If one is unable to understand the <br>meaning, he may still recite the text with the pur- <br>pose and hope that his salvation and progress <br>depends on it. Simple recitation of the original <br>words and lines is also a great blessing. If a person <br>is unable to read, he ought to spend a litle time <br>daily to learn to read. <br>(b) To ensure that one's own children as well as those <br>of the neighbours and friends are taught the Holy <br>Quran and other essential religious books as a first <br>step in their learning. <br>(4) Some time should be devoted each day to zikr, 3%. <br>which means concentrating on the Omnipotence, the Great- <br>8 8 <br>ness, and the Attributes of Allah Ta'ala, and to offer <br>DUROOD [prayers] for the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe <br>%& <br>wasallam). In this connection, guidance should be sought <br>from a \"Sheikh-e-Tariqat\" (a learned and saintly person), z; <br>who should be carefully selected for his distinction in <br>piety and his capacity to follow \"Shariat\" and \"Sunnah\". <br>He may prescribe certain \"Wazaif\" (special verses) to be re- <br>cited during the times of \"Zikr\". In case no such holy per- <br>son can be contacted, it is suggested that the following <br>\"Wazaif\" may be repeated a hundred times (one tasbih of <br>100 beads) each, both in the morning and in the evening: <br><br>3 0 <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>(a) Third Kalimah, <br>(b) Durood (praying blessings for the prophet). <br>(c) Istighfar (seeking forgiveness of Allah). <br>(5) Every Muslim must be considered as one's real <br>brother and must always be given affection, sympathy and <br>sincere attention at all times, particularly when he is in <br>need. The fact that a person professes the faith of Islam <br>automatically entitles him to brotherly respect and rever- <br>ence from all Muslims, who must at all times refrain from <br>causing him any physical or mental harm. <br>The above practices should be strictly enforced in <br>one's own life and, at the same time, efforts should be <br>made so that other people may follow them as well. The <br>only and the best way to achieve this is to devote some <br>time specially for learning and inculcating in oneself these <br>fine Islamic qualities, and also persuading others to make <br>similar efforts. Thus a joint and collective campaign will <br>automatically ensure for the growth and expansion of Islam <br>in its true form, which is the real and urgent need of the <br>day. <br>It was exactly this type of work, which every Prophet <br>of Allah Ta'ala had to do as his sole occupation. For the <br>sake of this work, almost all Prophets had to bear untold <br>miseries and perils. The worthy Companions of Hadhrat <br>Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe wasallam), as well as many <br>other distinguished Muslims of the early period of Islam, <br>spent the whole of their lives in striving hard and strug- <br>gling for the religion of Islam in this very manner. Most of <br>them sacrificed their lives in the sacred path of Allah <br>Ta'ala. It will be our misfortune and enormous loss if we <br>do not devote a part of our lifetime, however small a period <br>it may be, towards propagating and perpetuating Islam. We <br>must confess that it is due to our negligence in this vital <br>task that the Muslim society has reached its present state of <br>low morale and virtual collapse and, therefore, we must <br>rise and make manifold efforts. <br>r <br>I <br>1 <br>I <br>1 <br>I<br>I <br>i<br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>3 1 <br>Previously, the very purpose of being a Muslim was to <br>be ready to lay down one's life, honour and wealth for <br>upholding Islam and the Kalimah. In those days, if anyone <br>did not do that, he was considered to be ignorant and a <br>useless fellow. But alas! today, although we feel proud to <br>be called Muslims, we remain totally unmoved by the fact <br>that every particle of Islam is being destroyed one by one <br>before our very eyes, and not a finger is moved to check <br>this terrible loss. If we realise this we can appreciate that <br>the propagation of Islam is our real mission in life, and <br>therein lies our very existence as Muslims and also our <br>success, glory and ultimate salvation. The opposite is also <br>true that by neglecting this important task we suffer from <br>moral degeneration and social degradation. The only <br>remedy for this is that all of us must sincerely repent our <br>lethargic and injurious past and take immediate steps to re- <br>vive the act of Tabligh as our major occupation. It is only <br>then that we can expect the mercy and compassion of <br>Allah Ta'ala to flow, to bring us triumph and happiness <br>both in this life and the hereafter. <br>This does not mean that we should give up everything <br> <br>else, i.e., our profession-trade or employment and take <br>entirely to this work. It really means that, as we devote our <br>whole-hearted attention and time to other material voca- <br>tions, we should also attend to this work. As and when <br>some persons find themselves ready to take up this sacred <br>task, they should try to contact their friends or such per- <br>sons in their neighbourhood who may already be engaged <br> <br>in this work and spend a few hours a week in their com- <br>pany. The next step will be to spend, under the guidance of <br>those people, full three days every month outside in a <br>locdlity or a village other than one's own. Later, but as 34 <br>early as possible, to pass one full month, or better still, for- <br>6 g <br>ty days annually in some distant area in similar manner. <br>g;_ <br>i <br>Lastly, the real requirement in \"Tabligh\" is to spend con- <br>4.5 <br>tinuously four months once in the lifetime, in a given place <br>or area. All these periods are to be spent entirely in the <br>5 ;  <br>pursuit of learning and propagation of the true faith of <br>Islam and adopting the actual way of life under the Sacred <br>code of \"Shariat\". Thus our efforts will become extensive <br>and ultimately reach every person, rich and poor, employer <br>and employee, Land-Lord and Peasant, learned and <br>ignorant, to join hanas in this work and become bound in <br>the ties of true Islam as ordained by Allah Ta'ala and the <br>Holy Prophet Mohammad (sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br><br>PROCEDURE TO WORK <br>The most important factor in the task of Tabligh is the <br>manner and the method of approach, which simply means <br>to follow closely the lines adopted by the worthy Compan- <br>ions of the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) strict- <br>ly in accordance with his teachings and practices. The <br>method adopted by the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) was as follows: <br>A jamaat or group of at least ten men should be <br>formed. One of them should be selected \"amir\" (leader). <br>They should get together in a mosque, make ablutions and <br>offer two \"rakaat 'nafil' prayers. After this, all should sup- <br>plicate together and beseech for Divine mercy, help and <br>guidance for success in their efforts and remaining stead- <br>fast and resolute in their task of Tabligh. For all this time, <br>\"zikr\" should be recited by all, and every precaution <br>should be taken not to indulge in idle talk. On reaching the <br>place for \"Tabligh\", once again the \"jamaat\" should sup- <br>plicate and beseech for Allah Ta'ala's mercy and help in <br>their mission. The place of Tabligh will be the vicinity of a <br>mosque of the locality where the work is to be conducted. <br>A part of the \"jamaat\" should be detailed to tour the local- <br>ity calmly, and quietly inviting people to the mosque, <br>where \"ta'leem, (reading and teaching out of religious <br>books) should be in progress and later the \"namaz\" (pray- <br>ers) of the time should be offered. After this, one of the <br>members of the \"jamaat\" should place before the people, in <br>an affectionate and calm manner, the importance and <br>urgency of reviving Islam in each and every Muslim as or- <br>dained by Allah Ta'ala and the Holy Prophet (sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), giving out as simply as possible the car- <br>dinal points of Tabligh and the way to accomplish them. <br>Finally, the people should be persuaded, again in a cordial <br>manner, to join hands in this sacred task and come out to <br>do the work of Tabligh like the Jamaat itself. <br>Later, some members of the \"jamaat\" may accompany <br>the people to their homes, where the womenfolk should <br>also be addressed and persuaded to do similar duty amollg <br>women. <br>' <br>In formal prayers, a rakaat means one complete action comprising standing, <br>kneeling and bowing by placing the forehead on the ground, two \"rakaat\" <br>means two such actions. <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its pnly Remedy <br>They should be told to be regular in their daily pray- <br>ers. All this should be done without entering the private <br>portion of any house. The women should also be told to <br>strictly follow the cardinal points of \"Tabligh\" in their <br>daily life and observe \"pardah\" in accordance with the <br>\"Shriat\". <br>After this, all such people who may be prepared to join <br>the work should be organized into a separate \"jamaat\", <br>with and \"amir\" from among themselves. They should first <br>be made to work under the guidance of the members of the <br>original \"jamaat\". The important point to be remembered <br>at this stage is that every person engaged on \"Tabligh\" <br>must fully obey his \"amir\" and the latter, in turn, should <br>ensure that his personal services and attention are available <br>to each and every member of his Jamaat. He must see to <br>every person's welfare, comforts and morale and, before <br>taking any decision, he must consult all his colleagues. The <br>following general principles of the work of \"Tabligh\" <br>should be carefully noted at all times. <br>GENERAL PRINCIPLES <br>In its real form and sense, \"Tabligh\" is the most im- <br>portant type of worship of Allah Ta'ala and it amounts to a <br>blessing of very high order. It literally means to follow in <br>the footsteps cjf the Prophets. Truly, as the work is of a very <br>superior character, it must be based on equally high prin- <br>ciples, which ought to be strictly followed throughout. <br>Each participant must feel that it is he who needs to im- <br>prove himself rather than thinking of reforming others. <br>g , <br>During the course of work and, even away from it, he must <br>.c Z <br>try to behave as a perfect Muslim, as a faithful slave of Al- <br>c i <br>lah Ta'ala, constantly obeying and following the Divine <br>&3 <br>commands of \"Shariat\" and always seeking Allah Ta'ala's <br>4 $ <br>mercy and pleasure. This is the basic requirement and the <br>.g -2 <br>soul and foundation of the work of \"Tablfgh\". Once it is <br>3-u <br>deeply and firmly embedded in the hearts of workers, the 5 3 <br>other principles, rules and practices, some of which are <br>narrated below, will become easy to follow: <br>(1) As far as possible, all expenses, including travel- <br>ling, food etc., must be borne by each individual himself <br>and, if he can afford, he may quietly assist those compan- <br>ions who may be in need. <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>(2) All fellow workers and companions in this work <br>must be given full respect, shown tolerance, be cared for <br>and encouraged at'all times by one another. Such partici- <br>pation will prove a great blessing for the whole area where <br>the \"jamaat\" may be working. <br>(3) Conversations, talks and discussions must be con- <br>ducted in soft and persuasive tones, using simple and <br>polite language. All types of displeasure with each other <br>must be avoided. The \"ulema-e-karam\" (scholars of Mus- <br>lim scripture) must be held in high respect and esteem as <br>we usually display for the \"Holy Quran\" and \"Hadis\", be- <br>cause, it is through these learned personages that Allah <br>Ta'ala has blessed us with the true knowledge of Islam and <br>enlightenment. Any disrespect towards them, however in- <br>significant, may amount to contempt of Islam itself, which <br>in turn may provoke the wrath of Allah Ta'ala for the <br>whole community. <br>(4) Leisure and free moments must be spent either in <br>reading good religious books or in the company of pious <br>and learned companions; by this means one will be able to <br>learn many right things about the faith of Islam, about Al- <br>lah Ta'ala and His apostle. Particular care must be taken of <br>the time given to the \"Tabligh\" work itself, that nothing <br>unimportant, useless or senseless is uttered, discussed or <br>done. <br>(5) To endeavour to earn an honest and pure living, to <br>be most careful and frugal in expenditure, and to con- <br>stantly observe every single obligation, however big or <br>small, towards one's family, relations and acquaintances. <br>(6) No controversial matters or points of secondary im- <br>portance be discussed at any time. The total time must be <br>devoted to bringing out the Divinity, Oneness and Omni- <br>potence of Allah Ta'ala and to confine all talk to the main <br>points of \"Tabligh\", which are in real sense the basic prin- <br>ciples to be followed by each and every Muslim at all <br>times. <br>(7) Every action, work and speech must be fused with <br>sincerity and honesty of purpose, for an act, however <br>small, but imbued with this quality is destined to bring <br>high rewards and plenty of well-being. On the other hand, <br>an insincere act, however big, will not bear any worthwhile <br>fruit or benefit, either in this life or in the hereafter. Hadh- <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>rat Mu'az (Radi Allaho anho), who was appointed as Gov- <br>ernor of Yemen, begged the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) to give him some s ecial advice. The Holy <br>f <br>Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasal am) was pleased to say, <br>\"Be meticulously honest and sincere in matters of religion: <br>a little done with sincerity is enough\". There is yet another <br>\"Hadis\" in the same connection, \"Allah Ta'ala accepts <br>only such actions and deeds which are performed purely <br>for His pleasure and accord\". In another place' it is men- <br>tioned \"Allah Ta'ala does not look at your face nor at your <br>property, but only at your hearts and deeds\". So the crux of <br>the matter is that the work of \"Tabligh\" must be performed <br>with all sincerity and honesty, No show or ~utward appear- <br>ance is to be put on. The degree of success and progress <br>will depend entirely on the depth of our sincerity. <br><br>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION <br>A brief sketch of the work of \"Tabligh\", its importance <br>and urgent need have been discussed. It now remains to be <br>I <br>judged as to how all this can guide us and bring us the de- <br>sired relief and benefits in these times, which are fraught <br>with confusion, unrest and rivalries. <br>For this, once again, we have to seek guidance from the <br>allwise \"Holy Quran\", which refers to the hard work and <br>i <br>endurance for the faith of Islam as a highly profitable busi- <br>i <br>ness, and puts it across in the following manner: <br>i <br>\"0 you who believe! shall I point out to you a trade <br>that will shield you from a grievous doom? Believe in <br>Allah and His Messenger, and perform \"jehad\" in His <br>way with your wealth and lives. This is best for you, if <br>I <br>you understand. Your Lord will forgive your sins, and <br>you shall enter Paradise, under which ripple (beau- <br>teous) streams, and stately abodes in everlasting gar- <br>dens; and this is great success . . . <br>And another which you covet much, i.e., succour <br>from Allah and victory near at hand; and give glad <br>tidings to those who believe.\" <br>The above verse describes a trade, which if accepted <br>promises deliverance from all types of afflictions and pun- <br>ishments. The trade is meant: to have a firm faith in Allah <br>Ta'ala and His Apostle and to struggle hard in the path of <br>Allah, without shirking to use one's life and wealth. This <br>again points to the act of \"Tabligh\", which can ensure for <br>us everlasting well-being and happiness. It is this simple <br>work which will bring us great benefits, such as the for- <br>giveness for all our sins, deliberate mistakes and short- <br>comings and high rewards in the life hereafter. So much for <br>the success in the next life, which really is the greatest <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>triumph for a Muslim, but there is also clear hint for this <br>life too. We shall get what we cherish most, such as pros- <br>perity, divine help and success against all our adversaries! <br>In other words, Allah Ta'ala has demanded two things <br>from us, firstly to have firm faith in Him and His Apostle. <br>secondly, to struggle hard in His path, giving, if need be, <br>our lives and all that we possess. In return for this, He has <br>also promised two things: first a beautif91 and peaceful <br>abode in Heaven (Jannat) with an eternal life, and everlast- <br>ing happiness: and second, glory and success in this life. <br>The first demand on u s i s  that of faith (eiman). This is <br>exactly what the \"Tabligh\" is meant to bring to us, that we <br>should all be endowed with the wealth of true faith. The <br>second demand is that of striving in the path of Allah, <br>which actually means \"jehad\". Jehad may ncrmally mean <br>fighting a war against oppressors and non-believers. In the <br>practical sense, however, it means spreading of Kalimah of <br>Allah and enforcing of Allah's Commandments, which is <br>also the ultimate aim of \"Tabligh\". <br>It should be clear to us now that the happiness and <br>success in the life after death is solely dependent on having <br>firm faith in Allah Ta'ala and His Apostle, and in striving <br>hard in the path laid down by Him. Similarly, the success <br>and prosperity in this life too depend entirely on that very <br>faith and on spending all our efforts in the path of Allah <br>Ta'ala. <br>When we fulfil these basic requirements, firstly of faith <br>in Allah Ta'ala and His Apostle. and secondly of struggling <br>hard in their path, through these two attributes alone, we <br>can adorn ourselves with high moral virtues and excellence <br>6 , <br>of character. Only then can we fit to receive the promised <br>r Z <br>vicegerency of Allah Ta'ala and His kingdom on earth. <br>which are bound to come as is promised in the Holy <br>O& <br>Quran: <br>4 Z <br>. . <br>L;i gjLl j *' <br>\\ <br>,<br> <br>1 ? *  , <br>\\ <br>j <br>$9 <br>E ii <br>', . . <br>- P' d -  <br>, I <br>.@dj .& &-j\\ &jI <br># w, <br>( .& > <br>5 2 <br>. <br>.< <br>. <br>* .. <br>( \" 0  ,JI) <br>. <br>=i. <br>&,& <br>6 GI w p  g 2 <br>\"To those of you who believe and do righteous deeds, <br>Allah promises that He will certainly givc dominance <br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>to them in this world as He gave to those before you; <br>and the religion that has been chosen for them shall be <br>strengthened for them, and He will thereafter certainly <br>transform their fear into tranquillity, provided they <br>worship Me and associate none with Me.\" <br>The above verse portrays a forthright promise of king- <br>dom, but through \"eiman\" (firm faith) and righteous deeds. <br>This was actually fulfilled in the days of the Holy Prophet <br>(sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and remained in effect right <br>through the period on the \"Khulfa-e-Rashidin\" (the first <br>four Caliphs after the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). Practically the whole of Arabia had become an <br>Islamic State in the days of the Holy Prophet (sallallaho <br>alaihe wesallam) himself and the rest of the countries <br>(Muslim countries of today) mostly joined Islam during the <br>period of \"Khulfa-e-Rashdin\" or immediately after their <br>time. Later on too, the promise continued to be fulfilled in <br>favour of a number of Muslim kings and \"Khalifas\" and it <br>still awaits materialisation if someone fulfils the con- <br>ditions, as is clear from the next verse: <br>,., -.9 <br>41 +k <br>\"Surely Allahs followers shall dominate\" <br>In these few pages, an analysis of the present situation <br>and a practical solution for improving it has been given; in <br>fact the solution is nothing else than the actual Islamic way <br>of life, which belonged to our forefathers and early <br>Muslims. <br>CONCLUSION <br>In conclusion, it can be said that there is no way to <br>gain honour, happiness, peace and tranquillity in this life <br>other than to adopt and firmly hold on to the work and <br>system of \"Tabligh\". for which everyone of us must use all <br>his energies and wealth. <br>(1 .r d,+ <br>JT~ 149 ~j <br>41 +: I e I j  <br>\"Hold fast to the rope of Allah and do not create dis- <br>sensions.\" <br>FINAL APP~AL <br>This very system has actually been put into practico, in <br>the recent past, in the territory of Mewat (an area of Alwar <br>I <br><br>Muslim Degeneration and its only Remedy <br>State) and a few other districts around Llelhi (India). The <br>work in that region, has not yet reached the final stage; the <br>progress of the local Muslims, however, has been quite <br>marked. The blessing and benefits of the system of <br>\"Tabligh\" are clearly visible and worth witnessing. If all <br>Muslims collectively resolve to follow the noble example <br>mentioned above and adopt the correct system of life, as <br>described in this book, there is every hope that, through <br>that effort, Allah Ta'ala may obviate all our miseries and <br>adversities and we may be able to regain our faith, the <br>power to do righteous deeds and the resultant honour, dig- <br>nity and glory in this life and attain permanent salvation in <br>the next. The Muslims can then set an example for the rest <br>of the World to live in peace, tranquillity and happiness, <br>which is the natural desire of every man on earth. <br>An attempt has been made to explain as early as poss- <br>ible the real purpose behind the writing of this book, which <br>is to present to the readers the sketch of a practical way of <br>life, which about thirty years ago had been initiated and <br>vigorously followed by Hadhrat Maulana Mohammad Ilyas <br>Sahib, \"rahmatullah alaih\". He had in fact dedicated all his <br>life for this sacred purpose and mission. It is up to us, the <br>Muslims of the present time, to understand our obligations <br>towards Islam and fulfil them in our own interest and that <br>of the coming generations and the mankind at large. The <br>way is clear and well set. Let us begin the march and fix <br>our minds on the final goal, which is to acquire the pleas- <br>ure and approval of Allah Ta'ala. <br><br>Six Funda<br>by<br>Maulana Aa<br><br>amentals <br>y <br>ashiq Ilaahi <br><br>Six Fundam<br>In the name of Allah most G<br>First Lesson: Kali<br>Laa ilaaha illallaahu, Muha<br>This kalimah is just a sacre<br>That is, when a believer solem<br>admits before Allah that he is <br>vant, he will obey His-comma<br>the forbidden things.

Second, he should <br>n. Third, he should remem- <br>he should observe its practi- <br>dingly! <br>eir Translation <br>arts; first: \"Laa ilaaha illal- <br>ur-Rasulullaah\"; and their <br>ship but Allah, and Muham- <br>this Kalimah <br>that no one is worthy of <br>arily means that he should <br>verse, but the Almighty, and <br>m in worship, concerning all <br>hould believe Him to be his <br>distress, to be present every- <br>verything in the world. He <br>.z 1 <br> and should faithfully obey <br>a <br>r, he should not follow the <br>'? <br>contrary to His command- <br>= <br>Six Fundamentals <br>ments. In all the affairs of his life, he should follow the <br>teachings of the Holy Qur'aan; he should hope for His <br>mercy, and should fear His wrath; he should completely <br>rely upon Him for his guidance! <br>The second part of the kalimah, that is, \"Muhamma- <br>dur, Rasulullaah\" means, that after believing in the unity of <br>Allah, when I would desire to follow the commandments <br>of Allah, I cannot do so unless I keep Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) my instructor and guide to the Right <br>Path. That is, I will worship Allah just as he has told me; <br>he is a faithful and true messenger of Allah, who taught us <br>nothing of his own will or desire. The obedience of Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), is really the obedience <br>of Allah, and love for him, is love for Allah; one must be- <br>lieve that to be obedient to him is an obligatory thing, and <br>he should submit to his orders, without any objection. <br>Whatever he has told us of the unseen things like angels, <br>like Hell, Paradise the incidents in the grave, and the Res- <br>urrection, we must believe in them, though we could not <br>understand them. We must believe that the method of <br>living, which he has told us, and has behaved himself <br>accordingly, is the method which has been appreciated by <br>Allah; and anyone who acts contrary to it, does not tread <br>the Right Path, and is not loved by Allah. <br>The Requisites of Kalimah Tayyibah <br>When a Muslim has firm faith in the kalimah, un- <br>doubtedly he becomes a true believer, and then he has to <br>abandon all the forbidden things, and to observe the com- <br>mandments of Allah. That is why Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The first effect of 'Laa ilaaha il- <br>lallaah' is that it should prevent its reader from all the for- <br>bidden things.\" Therefore, the reader of such a sacred <br>kalimah must observe the commandments of Allah on all <br>occasions. He should keep them in mind in marriage, on <br>death, on taking meals, on going to sleep, on waking up, on <br>deals, and on all other occasions; he should faithfully ob- <br>serve the commandments of Allah, and should give up the <br>forbidden things. <br>The Benefits of the Kalimah <br>This kalimah has many spiritual benefits. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The most distinguished <br>I <br>#+<br>f <br>I <br>I <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>zikr is 'Laa ilaaha illallaah'. Again he says, \"Read the kali- <br>mah a hundred times every day, for it is the best compensa- <br>tion for one's sins, and no good deed is better t-han it.\" In <br>another hadith he says, \"Whoever reads 'Laa ilaaha illal- <br>laah' a hundred times in the morning, and a hundred times <br>in the evening shall have the reward of one who has re- <br>leased ten slaves from the posterity of Ismaa-eel (Alayhis <br>salaam)\" In another hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) says, \"Keep your faith fresh by reading and ob- <br>serving 'Laa ilaaha illallaah.'\" <br>Second Lesson: Salaat <br>When a Muslim has firmly believed in Kalimah Tayyi- <br>bah, he has made a sacred pledge to obey all the command- <br>ments of Allah; of which the first and foremost is salaat <br>which must be observed by every adult, male or female, <br>five times a day. In other words, those who perform the <br>prayer regularly, after believing in the kalimah, they practi- <br>cally fulfil their promise with Allah, made through the ka- <br>limah; and those who are not regular at the prayer, they <br>practically belie their promise with Allah, to be His faithful <br>servants; of them said Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) \"Whoever ,abandoned the prayer intentionally, he <br>become an infidel\". In another hadith he says, \"Whoever <br>gave up the prayer, he will be raised among Qaaroon, <br>Fir'own, his minister Haamaan, and the famous hypocrite <br>Ubayy bin Khalaf, on the Day of Resurrection.\" <br>Next to the kalimah, prayer is the most distinguished <br>of all good deeds. It has been mentioned in the hadith that <br>the first thing brought to account on the Day of Judgement, <br>will be the prayer. If one's prayer is perfect in every re- <br>spect, he will certainly attain salvation, otherwise he will <br>be deprived of all the boons and favours of Allah, and will <br>suffer a great loss. Therefore, one should observe the prayer <br>+ <br>at the appointed times, with good wudu and complete de- <br>votion, that one may not be raised with the infidels, and <br>should be delivered from the hell-fire. <br>Whatever is read in the Prayer (that is, 'Subhaanak-Al- <br>lahumma' and Attahiyyaat etc.), should be remembered <br>well, that no mistake should occur during the prayer. One <br>must know the fardh, the sunnah, and all the conditions of <br>prayer, so that it may be correct, and by having concentra- <br>tion, it should be performed well. <br>A great merit of the prayer is, that all the limbs of a <br>Six Fundamentals <br>worshipper, namely, hands, feet, head, waist, nose, fore- <br>head, tongue etc., are wholly and solely devoted to Allah, <br>that is, every part of a worshipper's body is engaged in an <br>exercise of the obedience of Allah's commandments. If a <br>Muslim performs the prayer with all its conditions, he is <br>not likely to commit sin by any limb, on times other than <br>the prayer. It has been mentioned in the Holy Qur'aan that <br>the prayer prevents a Muslim from shameful and forbidden <br>things. The believers have been commanded hundreds of <br>times in the Holy Qur'aan to perform the prayer properly. <br>In the hadith also the prayer has been enjoined and empha- <br>sised many a time. For instance, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said, \"One's sins from one prayer to an- <br>other are forgiven by Allah\". <br>In another hadith he says, \"If one has a stream at one's <br>door, and he has a bath in it, five times a day, he will have <br>no dirt on his body; similarly if one performs the .prayer <br>five times a day, his sins will be pardoned by Allah, and he <br>will !be clean of them\". In another hadith Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"When your children are <br>seven years old, instruct them to perform the prayer, but <br>when they are ten years old, beat them to perform the <br>prayer.\" <br>Prayer with Congregation <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says in a <br>hadith, \"The prayer with congregation is granted a reward <br>twenty-seven times more than the prayer performed <br>alone\". It has also been mentioned in a hadith that Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) intended to burn the <br>houses of those who did not visit the musjid to perform the <br>rayer with congregation, but he abstained from doing so, <br>[ecause of children and women. Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) says, \"During the time of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) only that hypocrite dared neglect the <br>prayer who was a declared hypocrite.\" It has also been <br>mentioned in a hadith that peforming the night prayer with <br>congregation begets the reward of prayers till midnight; <br>and performing the morning prayer with congregation, <br>begets the reward of prayers during the whole night. <br>The right way to perform rukoo' and sajdah <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says in a <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>hadith, \"Allah does not look to the prayer of one, who does <br>not keep his waist straight in the prayer (he prays lazily)\". <br>In another hadith he says, \"The worst kind of theft is the <br>theft of prayer\". His Companions asked, \"What is the theft <br>of prayer?\" He answered, \"The theft of prayer is, not to per- <br>form the rukoo' (bending the knees) and sajdah (prostra- <br>tion) properly, with full time and attention.\" <br>A prayer out of time <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"It is the <br>prayer of a hypocrite to cause delay in prayers, and to wait <br>for sun-set; so when it becomes dull, he gets up to perform <br>it just as a custom, and he remembers Allah but little.\" <br>Third Lesson <br>Knowledge and Zikr <br>There are two important subjects in this lesson; first, <br>knowledge, second, zikr (that is, remembrance of Allah). <br>There are so many sayings of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) which stress the utility and distinction of these <br>two things. For instance, a hadith says, \"Beware! This <br>world, and whatever is in it, is cursed by Allah, with the <br>exception of prayers, and zikr, and the religious scholar, <br>and the religious student\". <br>Therefore, every Muslim should try his best to achieve <br>the high standard of knowledge and zikr. <br>Knowledge <br>Only that knowledge is appreciated by Allah, which <br>takes a man nearer to Him, and enables him, to observe His <br>commandments. So much knowledge of the religion of <br>Islam, as would purify and strengthen one's faith, is obliga- <br>tory for every Muslim man and woman. When a servant of <br>Allah has entirely submitted himself to Allah, and has <br>promised to observe His commandments, it is indispens- <br>able for him to know all His commandments, and the <br>method of worship. Yes, he should have a perfect knowl- <br>edge of prayers, fasting, poor-rate, hajj; of mutual dealings <br>B <br>.X f <br>in everyday life, the true Islamic culture, and other import- <br>m or <br>ant aspects of Islamic way of living. Every Muslim should <br>particularly know those basic things about Islam, the ignor- <br>rZ <br>Six Fundamentals <br>ance of which is likely to commit sins; and when he has <br>got the knowledge of these things, he must observe them in <br>a practical form, for it has been mentioned in a hadith, <br>\"Verily, the worst punishment of Allah will be inflicted on <br>those on the Day of Judgement, who have been scholars of <br>religion, but did not practice it themselves\". <br>The distinction of a scholar and a student <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said in a <br>hadith, \"Anyone who shows the Right Path to a Muslim, is <br>like one who has already observed Allah's command- <br>ments\". Another hadith says, \"A thousand worshippers are <br>not so annyoing and deadly to Shaytaan, as one person <br>who has achieved perfect knowledge about Islam\". An- <br>other hadith says, \"Anyone who died during the period of <br>attaining knowledge about Islam, his class in Jannah will <br>be only one stage below the Ambiyaa\". Another hadith <br>says, \"The best person among you is he, who has learned <br>the Holy Qur'an and then teaches it to other Muslims\". Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says in another <br>hadith, \"May Allah keep that person fresh and healthy who <br>listens to my instructions, and then delivers them to others, <br>exactly as I have spoken\". <br>To leave home for the sake of knowledge <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Whoever left his home for the sake of knowledge (about <br>the Holy Qur'aan and Islam), he will be honoured as one, <br>who has entirely devoted himself to Allah\". <br>The service and help for a student of Islam <br>It has been mentioned in a hadith, that Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) while addressing his followers <br>said, \"Undoubtedly, the coming generation will follow <br>you, for you have followed me. After me people will come <br>to you from remote places to attain the knowledge of Islam. <br>So, when they visit you, it is my will, that you should en- <br>tertain them well\". That is, when the student of Islam visit <br>you, serve them properly, sit in their society, and be cour- <br>teous to them. <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>The use of scholarly meetings <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says in a <br>hadith, \"When certain people gather together in the House <br>of Allah (that is a musjid), and they read the Book of Allah <br>(i.e., the Holy Qur'aan) to one another, they are blessed <br>with spiritual consolation and Allah's mercy, the Angels <br>assemble around them, and Allah remembers them among <br>His courtiers (Angels)\". <br>Zikr <br>The second part of the third lesson is zikr. The highest <br>degree of zikr is that a believer should be entirely devoted <br>to Allah, and should never forget Him. This standard of <br>zikr is achieved by constant spiritual exercise, and by con- <br>tinuous remembrance of Allah. Those who have realized <br>the spiritual benefits of zikr, they do not neglect it for a <br>single moment of their life. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) instructed a companion of his with the follow- <br>ing words, \"Keep your tongue always busy with the re- <br>membrance of Allah\". In another hadith he says, \"When <br>some people gather together in an assembly, and then get <br>up without remembering Allah, be sure that they sat <br>around the dead body of an ass, and left it; therefore such <br>an assembly will be a sorrow to them on the Day of Qiyaa- <br>mah\". <br>The true believers should remember Allah most often, <br>and by contemplating th\"e wonders of His creation, they <br>should glorify Him, and thereby strengthen their love for <br>Him. The more they remember Allah, the better will be <br>their good deeds, the stronger their faith and knowledge. <br>Then, they will have more and more love for Allah, and <br>their service to Him will be more sincere and realistic. Par- <br>ticularly, during the Tabligh journey they should not forget <br>Allah for a single moment. If all the daily prayers, which <br>are mentioned in the hadith, viz, prayer for going to sleep <br>and waking up, prayer at the end of a meeting, prayer for <br>the beginning and the end of the meals, prayer for entering <br>home and going out, prayer for starting a journey, and <br>prayer for returning from it, prayer for riding an animal (or <br>any other transport), prayer for entering a new town or a <br>city etc., are remembered well, and are read on the relevant <br>occasion, naturally the exercise of the remembrance of <br>Allah can be improved to a great extent. No amount of time <br>Six Fundamentals <br>is sufficient for a sacred thing like zikr, yet most spare time <br>should be devoted to the same; but the least thing that <br>every Muslim can do, is to read the kalimah, and Durood <br>Sharief, and Istighfaar (each a complete Tasbeeh) every <br>morning and evening; moreover, a time should be fixed for <br>the recitation of the Holy Qur'aan. Even some worldly loss <br>can easily be tolerated for the boundless boons of Allah, <br>that are going to be granted to a believer in the next life! <br>The preference of zikr <br>It has been mentioned in the hadith that zikr purifies <br>and enlightens the heart. Another hadith says that nothing <br>saves a Muslim from the chastisement of Allah, more than <br>zikr. Another Hadith says that amongst the negligent, one <br>who remembers Allah most often is like a.glowing lamp in <br>a dark house. A hadith of Bukhaari says, \"One who remem- <br>bers Allah, is remembered by Him among His courtiers <br>(Angels)\". Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in an- <br>other hadith says, \"Anyone who remembers Allah most <br>often, is so much preferable to a person, who distributes a <br>great amount of money in the way of Allah\". <br>(Targheeb) <br>Fourth-Lesson <br>Honour for a Muslim <br>The gist of this lesson is that every Muslim should re- <br>alise the rights of other Muslims, and should observe them <br>practically, according to the order of the classes and ranks <br>of his brethren in Islam. Particularly, he should have great <br>regard for the honour of a Muslim, who deserves Teverance <br>by all means, for he has the light of faith in his heart. Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says in a hadith, \"He is <br>not one of us, who does not respect our elders, and does <br>not show mercy to our youngsters and is not respectful to <br>our scholars\". Another hadith says, \"Only a hypocrite <br>could insult these three person; first, an aged Muslim; <br>second, a religioug scholar; third, a Muslim king, who ob- <br>serves justice\". <br>According to the teachings of the Holy Qur'aan, and <br>hadith, here are the most important qualities of a true be- <br>liever. He should realise the rights of Allah's creatures, and <br>should be polite and humble to them. He should like for <br>others, what he likes for himself. He should not be envious <br>I <br>Six .Fundamentals <br>of others, nor should he have malice about them. He must <br>not be proud. He should be courteous and loving to all. He <br>should be the first to greet a Muslim. He should be gener- <br>ous enough to pardon those who have offended him. He <br>should go to visit the sick. He should respect all just as he <br>respects himself. He should avoid back-biting. He should <br>overlook the weaknesses of others. If anyone consults him, <br>he should give him the right and honest counsel. He <br>should give financial help to the poor and the needy. He <br>should not rejoice in the misery of others. And the most <br>distinguished and valuable service to a Muslim is that he <br>should be instructed with a firm faith in Allah, in the Day <br>of Judgement, and to be prepared for it with a lot of good <br>deeds, so that he should be delivered of the chastisement <br>thereon. Undoubtedly, this is the best service to a bro!her <br>in Islam. <br>Islam has instructed all the Muslims with a collective <br>life, and has enjoined unity to them, that they should pro- <br>vide peace and prosperity for one another. For instance, <br>they have been instructed to put on their best clothes, and <br>apply perfume to them for the Jumu'ah and the Eid prayers; <br>they have been prevented from jumping over the necks of <br>the worshippers, or to sit between two persons without <br>their permission, or to remove anyone from his sitting <br>place. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"A true <br>Muslim is he, who does not offend any other Muslim with <br>his tongue or hand; and a true believer is he, who does not <br>cause any loss to another believer\". In another hadith Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"That person will <br>not enter Jannah, whose neighbour is not safe from his of- <br>fence\". <br>These sayings of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) clearly indicate that a believer should behave so cour- <br>teously towards others, that they should never fear trouble <br>or a loss from his quarters. <br>In another hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) says, \"Whoever helps a poor and miserable person, <br>Allah will grant him seventy three rewards, of which only <br>one would be sufficient to put his affairs aright in this <br>world. and the other seventy two rewards will sublimate <br>his ranks in the life hereafter\". Another hadith says, <br>\"When a Muslim leaves his home to see another Muslim, <br>seventy thousand angels see him off, and all of them bless <br>him with the mercy of Allah\". Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) says about a co-traveller, \"Only that person is <br>Six Fundamentals <br>your chief in a journey, who serves his companions best; <br>no one can supercede such a person, except a martyr\". <br>Fifth Lesson <br>Sincerity of Intention <br>This is also called the \"correction of intention\". That <br>is, whenever a person intends to do something good, he <br>must not be tempted by some wordly interest, but should <br>do it purely for the pleasure of Allah, and to have its <br>reward in the life hereafter. This purity of intention can be <br>achieved only when he has a firm faith in the reward <br>which Allah and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>have promised for our good deeds, and, therefore, the hope <br>.of this reward should be our motive in good deeds. That is <br>why Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The <br>reward for your deeds depends entirely on your intention, <br>and everyone is paid in accordance with the nature of his <br>intention\". It means, that it is not merely the action which <br>ensures a reward from Allah, but it is the sincerity of our <br>intention, which will ensure it. If an action is void of good <br>intention, and is undertaken for the sake of passion, or to <br>please men, or to attain some wordly interest, then it is <br>hollow, lifeless and deserves no reward from Allah. A <br>hadith to this effect says, \"All the deeds af men will be <br>gathered together before Allah. on the Day of Qiyaamah; of <br>them only the deeds which are purely done for Allah, will <br>be separated, and the rest will be thrown into hell\". (Targheeb) <br>When certain good deeds are done purely for Allah, it <br>is called \"Ikhlaas\" and whenever a believer intends to do <br>something based on sincerity, the evil self, or the Shaytaan <br>cause hinderances in his way. Therefore it is indispensable <br>to sincerity that one should forsake the wordly tempta- <br>tions, and should believe in the everlasting boons and <br>favour of the life hereafter. Those who have realized the <br>value of sincerity, they apply it to their werldlv affairs also. <br>They observe the sincerity of intention in eating, drinking, <br>sleeping, awaking, walking, earning their living etc., but <br>this standard of sincerity cannot be achieved without the <br>company of saints and devouts. As an example. our relig- <br>ious scholars have told us that by observing fasts, if some- <br>one desires its reward and good health at the same time; or, <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>if by undertaking a pilgrimage, one wishes reward, recre- <br>ation, and safety from the enemy: or, if by giving alms to a <br>beggar, one has an intention to have its reward from Allah, <br>appreciation from the onlookers, and to silence the beggar, <br>then all the above-mentioned deeds will be void of sincer- <br>ity. A companian of Rasululla (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>asked him, \"What is faith?\" He replied, \"Another name for <br>faith is sincerity!\" (Targheeb) In another hadith Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says. \"pbserve sincerity in <br>your deeds, then even a few good ddeds will have the <br>reward of great virtue for you!\" (Targheeb). Another com- <br>panion of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>him, \"One man participates in the holy war for the sake of <br>riches, and another man participates in it for the sake of <br>reputation, that he may be called a hero; say, 0 Messenger <br>of Allah, who is fighting in the way of Allah?\"' He <br>answered, \"Only that person fights in the way of AHah, <br>who wants to propagate and establish the truth told by Him <br>(in the Holy Qur'aan)\". <br>(Bukhaari, Muslim) <br>Those who do not desire the pleasure of Allah by their <br>deeds, but wish only the worldly achievements, they are <br>certainly hypocrites, and this (hypocrisy) is a desease of <br>the heart, which our spiritualists say, is the root of all evils. <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to his <br>companions, \"The thing I fear most in your actions, is <br>smaller polytheism\". His companions asked, \"What is <br>smaller polytheism?\" He answered, \"Show (of one's good <br>deeds!)\" Another hadith says, \"Whoever made a show of <br>his prayer, or fasting, or charity, he committed poly- <br>theism\". Another hadith says, \"There is a pit of sorrow in <br>Jahannam, of which Jahannam even seeks refuge, of Allah; <br>those worshippers, who make a show of their worship, will <br>be thrown into it\". <br>Sixth Lesson <br>The spare time <br>A believer should spare as much time as possible; for <br>the preachment of the commandments of Allah, even if he <br>has to leave his home and family for this nobld cause. <br>During this stage of life one should exercise the previous <br>six lessons, for a long experience has told us that-by stick- <br>ing to one's home and familv and the business, one cannot <br>Six Fundamentals <br>learn or teach the principles of Islam, nor one can adopt <br>the original and traditional Islamic culture, particularly in <br>this age of materialism. <br>Therefore, one should get rid of worldly engagements, <br>to serve Allah and His true religion. In this course, a be- <br>liever sitould join the group of the preachers of Islam, and <br>should call those to the right path, who are lost in this <br>fleeting world, and have forgotten immortal life hereafter. <br>To call the wrong doing and negligent people to Allah, <br>and to instruct them with His commandments, was really <br>the duty of the Ambiyaa, which has now been entrusted to <br>the Muslims. The true following of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) requires that every Muslim should devote <br>himself to his service, and should sacrifice everything for <br>the preachment of his true religion (Islam). Just as Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself bore so many <br>troubles for the sake of Islam, similarly every follower of <br>his should also follow his footsteps. <br>The companions of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) had properly realised the requisites of Tabligh, and, <br>therefore, they tolerated the troubles of this world, for the <br>sake of the boons and favours of Allah in the next life. <br>They gladly devoted themselves to the service of Allah. <br>and preferred the needs of religion to the needs of worldly <br>life. Sometimes, they ate leaves, or a single date, and <br>walked barefoot on long journies, in the way of Allah. <br>During the time of the Sahabah it was necessary to propa- <br>gate Islam, and to spread it far and wide, but today we have <br>to revive it; just as those believers performed their duty by <br>the sacrifice of their lives, we should also follow their ex- <br>ample. <br>Leaving one's home and family for the cause of Allah, <br>has great rewards for the subject, in the next life, just as Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has clearly told us. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Whoever spends his morning or evening in the way of <br>Allah, his reward will be much better then the whole <br>world, and whatever is in it.\" (Bukhaari and Muslim). In <br>another hadith he says, \"The fire of Jahannam will not <br>reach anyone whose feet become dusty whilst he is on the <br>path of tillah.\" <br>When we instruct the servants of Allah with His com- <br>mandments, it means we have fulfilled the duty of Tabligh, <br>and have revived it, for Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said, \"When people see others committing sins, <br>I <br>f <br>I <br>I <br>I <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>and do not prevent them from the same, soon Allah will in- <br>flict a punishment on them, which will affect the common <br>folk, as well as the distinguished persons\". <br>A hadith of Tirmizi Sharief says, \"I swear by Allah. <br>you must command people with good deeds, and prevent <br>them from forbidden things, or soon Allah will inflict a <br>severe punishment to you, and then your prayers even will <br>not be heard by Him!\" <br>A verse of the Holy Qur'aan says, <br>\"There must be a group among you, who should invite <br>people to good, and should induce them to legal things. <br>and should prevent them from illegal things; and certainly <br>these will attain salvation\". <br>Another verse says, <br>\"0 Muslims! You are the best nation, who has been <br>chosen for the guidance of other nations; you command <br>people with virtue, and prevent them from vice, and have a <br>firm faith in Allah!\" <br>It has been reported by Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"You <br>must induce people to good deeds, and prevent them from <br>bad ones, otherwise Allah will bring such a tyrant sover- <br>eign over you, who will not respect your elders, nor will he <br>show mercy to your youngsters; then the prayers of your <br>pious people even will not be granted by Allah; if you <br>called Him, He will not pardon you!\" <br>e <br><br>Six Fundam :ntals <br>Seventh Lesson <br>To quit vanity <br>This lesson will explain the most important requisites <br>of piety. A Muslim should spend every moment of his life <br>in the achievement of the eternal boons of the life hereafter. <br>He should not only avoid the sins, but also the vain and de- <br>structive customs of his age, which affect our religious <br>principles and beliefs so badly. Though there may not be <br>sin in so many deeds and hobbies, yet they are a sheer <br>waste of time and energy, and we could do some other con- <br>structive things during that time. This is the characteristic <br>of a true believer that he spends his time only in virtuous <br>deeds, remembers Allah as much as possible, avoids all for- <br>bidden things, does not indulge in vanity, and is polite and <br>humble towards other Muslims. If one does not avoid vain <br>talk and vain deeds, one is likely to indulge in shameful <br>sins. It has been mentioned in a hadith that when a com- <br>panion of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) died, a <br>Muslim said to him. \"I deliver to you the happy news of <br>Jannah!\" When Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>heard these words, he said, \"You are giving him the happy <br>news of Jandah, while you dont know he might have in- <br>dulged in vain talk, or, have been a miser in spending a <br>thing for the good of others, which does not decrease by <br>use\". This evidently means that one should be very cau- <br>tious in talk, and should avoid vanity, for one's tongue is <br>likely to talk nonsense. <br>Another hadith says, \"A man does not slip so much by <br>his feet, as by his tongue\". <br>Another hadith says, \"Sometimes a man speaks an of- <br>fensive and sinful thing unconsciously, by which he is <br>thrown into hell deeper than the distance between East and <br>West!\" <br>(Bukhaari & Muslim) <br>Therefore, every believer should be cautious in his <br>talk, and should spend every moment of his life in good <br>deeds. He must avoid vanity, particularly, during the <br>oeriod when he has left home to learn his religion, or to <br>preach the same. <br>Someone asked Luqmaan the philosopher, \"How did <br>vou attain so much wisdom?\" He answered, \"Because I <br>speak the truth, pay the securities to their owners, and <br>avoid vanity!\" <br>(Muwatta Imaam Maalik) <br>t <br>J <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>Hadhrat Sahl Tastari says, \"Anyone who desires that <br>the qualities and signs of the truthful should be revealed to <br>him, he must not eat anything but pure and legal, and <br>should follow the Sunnah very strictly\". <br>(Ihya-ul-Ulobm) <br>In another hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said, \"The perfection of one's faith in Islam, requires <br>that one should give up vanity altogether\". <br>The Holy Qur'aan mentions a great quality of true be- <br>lievers, <br>\"Those who do not indulge in vanity!\" <br>N.B.-All the ahaadith, which have no references have been <br>quoted from Mishkaat Sharief. <br>The requisites of a journey for Tabligh <br>1. When a believer has determiid to undertake such a <br>journey, he should say the following prayer, <br>\"0 Allah! I attack the enemy with your help, I plan my <br>work with Your help, and I walk on the earth with <br>Your help\". <br>2. When he has left home, he should read, <br>\"I start my journey with the name of Allah, I entirely <br>depend on Allah; the power to do good and to avoid <br>evil is from Allah\". <br>V) <br>3. The group of preachers should have a leader in this <br>journey, who can be another person than the leader of <br>the group. <br>z, <br>?;) <br>4. When he rides and puts his feet in the stirrup, he <br>should say \"Bismillaah\" and when he sits on the back <br>16 <br>Six Fundamentals <br>of the animal, he should say \"Alhamdu lillaah\"; and <br>then he should read this verse, <br>\"Glory be to Allah, who has subjected this animal to <br>us, and we could not overpower it without His help; <br>and at last we have to return to our Sustainer!\" <br>\"Then he should say \"Alhamdu lillaah\" thrice, and <br>then \"Allaahu Akbar\" thrice, and then he should say, <br>\"0 Allah! You are clear of evil; I have been unjust to <br>my.soul! therefore, forgive me, for no one pardons sins, <br>but You!\". <br>5. When he has ridden, and the animal walks, or, when <br>he himself begins to walk. he should say, <br>\"0 <br>Allah! I seek Your refuge from the hardships of this <br>journey, and from the calamities of my return, and <br>from failure after success, and from the ill prayers of <br>the oppressed, and from loss of wealth and my <br>i <br>family'' <br>6. When he ascends some high place, he should say \"Al- <br>laahu Akbar\" thrice, and when he descends, he should <br>say \"Subhaanallaah\" thrice; and when he passes <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>through a plain or a stream, he should say \"Laa ilaaha <br>illallaah\" and \"Allaahu Akbar\" (Hisn) <br>7. When he has to walk on foot, he should be pleased to <br>do so; rather he should prefer to walk on foot, for this <br>is a Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and his companions. Hence, he should get himself <br>used to the troubles of this journey, which is a source <br>of Allah's boons and favours, in the next life. <br>8. If his foot slips somewhere, or hits some obstacle, he <br>should say \"Bismillah\". (Hisn Haseen) <br>9. When he sets foot at some station or destination, he <br>should say, <br>\"With the complete words of Allah, I seek refuge from <br>the evil of whatever He has created\". <br>10. When he enters some village or a city, he should say <br>thrice, <br>\"0 <br>Allah! let it be auspicious for us.\" <br>Then he should say this prayer, <br>\"0 <br>Allah! Let us enjoy the fruits of this city, and infuse <br>our love into the hearts of the people of this city, and <br>cause the love of the pious of this city in our hearts\". <br>(Hisn Haseen) <br>11. He should serve his companions as much as he can, <br>and should take pride in it. It has been mentioned in a <br>hadith, \"Only that person is your leader in a journey, <br>who serves you more than him, except a martyr\". <br>(Mishkaat Sharief) <br>Six Fundamentals <br>The duties of a leader <br>Here are the duties of a leader on a journey of religious <br>preachment: <br>1. He should provide comfort for his companions. He <br>should consult his companions, and if he disagrees <br>with anyone on a certain topic, he should not discour- <br>age him, and should tell him the utility of another's <br>opinion, whose counsel is more useful. <br>2. He should not be hard upon any companion, and <br>should not speak to him in the tone of command. <br>3. He should behave towards his companions, according <br>to their status. <br>4. If some of his companions are capable of speech, he <br>should give them an opportunity to deliver a speech, <br>and if somebody's speech is not according to 'the aims <br>and objects of the group, he should prevent him from <br>the same in such words, as would not displease or dis- <br>hearten him. <br>5. He should prevent his companions from vain things in <br>a polite and favourable manner. <br>6. He should instruct them with the.morning and evening <br>zikr, particularly when they are out for Tabligh work. <br>7. He himself should appoint a leader for preachment, a <br>leader for mutual talk, and if he does not find any effi- <br>cient person for this purpose, he himself s h o ~ ~ l d  <br>adopt <br>this office. <br>8. During the journey even, he should instruct his corn- <br>panions to remember the Tabligh lessons well; he <br>should advise them to remember the prayers for all <br>occasions, by heart. <br>9. He should entrust the ignorant to the scholars, that <br>they may learn prayers, etc., from them. <br>10. If he thinks it proper, he should distribute various <br>duties among his companions. For instance, some of <br>them should awake others for the Tahajjud prayer, <br>some of them should lead them for Chaasht and Ish- <br>. raaq prayers, and some of them should instruct others <br>with morning and evening zikr. <br>I<br>Six Fundamentals <br>11. If there is some friction among his companions, he <br>should reconcile them. <br>12. He should instruct his companions again and again, <br>with the fear of Allah, and preparation for the next life, <br>and should solemnly advise them in the following <br>words: \"We have left our homes to reform ourselves, <br>before we reform others. Our real aim and object <br>during this journey is that being in the company of the <br>pious, and the God-fearing, we should strengthen our <br>relationship with them, should perform our prayers in <br>the best possible manner. 'Thus we should remember <br>Allah as much as possible, should serve one another <br>sincerely, and should devote ourselves to all good <br>deeds, preventing ourselves from forbidden things. All <br>the time that we have devoted to Tabligh work, is not <br>ours at all, but for the promotion and establishment of <br>the true religion of Allah. Therefore, we should make <br>much of this time, and should learn and teach our re- <br>ligion. We lost our lives in vanity, but at least now we <br>should spend the rest of our life, just as a true Muslim <br>would do. We should fulfil the requisites of this jour- <br>ney at their best\". <br>Knowledge and zikr <br>1. The subject of the teachings of the Tablighi group is to <br>have a comprehensive and reliable knowledge of <br>I <br>Islam, and to preach the same to other Muslims so that <br>they have a keen interest in Islam. Moreover, this <br>group must know the promises and the command- <br>ments of Allah, and should observe them practically. <br>2. In the education course of this group the prayer and <br>the Holy Qur'aan have a great importance, but the time <br>which is required to learn these things perfectly, <br>cannot be acquired on this brief Tabligh journey. <br>Therefore, the companions are expected to realize the <br>i <br>importance of salaali and learning the Holy Qur'aan, <br>during this journey, that they should devote more and <br>more time to this subject, in the future. <br>3. The members of the group should also contemplate <br>their past life, and they should be sorry for not devot- <br>ing themselves to Tabligh work in the past, and they <br>should seek Allah's forgiveness. And those who are <br>Six Fundamentals <br>still ignorant of their religion, should be sorry for their <br>negligence, and should repent for the future. <br>4. In all the spare time they should remember Allah; they <br>should engage in zikr not only their tongue, but their <br>heart also. <br>5. Those who know their religion, should teach it to <br>others as a duty, and those who are still ignorant about <br>it, should learn the same very attentively. <br>6. One cannot learn all the teachings of the religion only <br>by studying the books, or by listening to the orators; <br>knowledge of Islam and the practice thereof are indis- <br>pensable to each other, and perfection in faith cannot <br>be acquired without action. Therefore, one must prac- <br>tise what he knows, and should also instruct others <br>with the same. <br>7. All the mistakes that one commits during the reading <br>of the Holy Qur'aan, or the prayer, their correction <br>should not be limited only to the teaching class, but <br>one should try his best to correct them during his lei- <br>sure at home. <br>8. All the members of the group should sit silent and re- <br>spectfully in the class, while they are instructed, and <br>should not pay attention to anything else; only the <br>leader of education should correct their mistakes, but <br>others should keep silent, and having regard for Allah <br>and His Messenger, they should sit motionless, as if <br>birds were sitting on their heads. <br>9. In the circle of instruction the following things should <br>be observed very attentively. <br>(a) The teachings of the Holy Qur'aan, particularly in <br>relation with the principles of Islam; all the poss- <br>ible mistakes concerning i n a a l ,  : Zaa, <br>Seen, <br>J' Saud, C Haa, A Haa, Ayn, a Hamzah, GJ Taa, <br>L Tau, FathaJZabar etc., should be avoided with <br>great care. <br>(b) The words of Kalimah Tayyibah should be remem- <br>bered properly, and their meaning should be <br>understood thoroughly, so much so that everyone <br>should believe that Islam is incomplete without <br>putting the kalimah into practice. <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>(c) The basic conditions and requisites of salaah <br>should be learnt well; whatever is read in salaah, <br>should be remembered well: the reward of salaah <br>should be stressed, and the punishment for neg- <br>lecting it should be told again and again; more- <br>over, the methods to attain concentration in <br>salaah, should be practised. <br>(d) All the punishments that are mentioned in the <br>Qur'aan and hadith, for neglecting the requisites of <br>salaah, kalimah, reverence for a Muslim, Islamic <br>knowledge, zikr, Tabligh work etc., should be told <br>to the students; mxeover the reward for observing <br>them should also be explained, from reliable <br>books. <br>(e) The important features of the life of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) should also be told to <br>the class. For instance, how he observed the Pray- <br>ers, a'nd how he led his daily life. Thus, by study- <br>ing the biography of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and his companions, a Muslim should <br>learn that in spite of troubles and obstacles, how <br>they preached Islam far and wide, and how they <br>dealt with their families and business, being true <br>and just to everyone. <br>(f) All the members of the group should assist one <br>another in learning their Tabligh lessons, viz., the <br>kalimah, salaah, Islamic knowledge. zikr, honour <br>for a Muslim, sincerity, setting aside time to do <br>good deeds, and abstaining from useless things. <br>And then, they should instruct each other to lead <br>their life according to these lessons. <br>10. They should read one Tasbeeh of Durood Sharief, one <br>of the kalimah, and one of Istighfaar, every morning <br>and evening; and if they have good books of prayer like <br>'Dalaail-ul-Khairaat, Hizb-al-Aazam, Munaajaate Maq- <br>bool, they should also read them regularly. <br>11. They should spend all their leisure in the remem- <br>brance of Allah, and should keep their tongues busy <br>with zikr. <br>The optional prayers <br>The \"nawaafil\" or the \"optional prayers\" should also be <br>Six Fundamentals <br>observed during the Tabligh journey. The Ishraaq, the <br>Chaasht, the Tahajjud, the Awwaabeen, the Nawaafil after <br>fardh. and the sunnah prayer, should be observed very <br>carefully. These prayers are generally neglected at home, <br>but they can be performed during the journey, if you find <br>leisure; yet all the persons in the Tabligh group must know <br>that the duty of preachment is more important than the op- <br>tional prayers. That is to say. preachment has a priorty over <br>the nawaafil, and you can easily give up the latter for the <br>former. Observe the requisites of Tabligh first and perform <br>the nawaafil afterwards. <br>Gasht (To go around for an informal visit and the special <br>visit) <br>1. The real object of going around for an informal visit or <br>a special visit for the purpose of Tabligh is that the <br>worldly and business places like bazaars, streets, and <br>the markets should also be blessed and benefitted with <br>the remembrance of Allah, and the faith of the group <br>should strengthen the faith of others, and vice versa. <br>Remember, this Tabligh work is exactly the following <br>of the Tabligh work observed bv Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>aiaihe wasallam), who observed it by going around <br>from home to home. <br>2. <br>When you go around for an informal or a special visit. <br>lower your gaze, and keep your tongue and heart busy <br>with the remembrance of Allah. This attitude of yours <br>will effect the hearts of others, to a great extent. <br>3. <br>The going arohnd for informal visits and special visits <br>must be done before the Prayer time, and during your <br>Gasht instruct others with the requisites of the kalimah <br>and the principles of Islam; moreover, call the listeners <br>to the prayer in the mosque, and ask them to join vour <br>Tabligh group. <br>4. <br>Do not ask everyone to let you hear his kalimah, nor <br>compel1 him to perform the prayer, for such an attitude <br>would sometimes cause unfavourable results. That is <br>why. you are advised to take the educated and influ- <br>encial people of that locality with you, so that he <br>should talk to _them according to their reason- and <br>status. <br>5. <br>Pray to Allah before you start Gasht, and call upon <br><br>Six Fundamenlals <br>Him with all humbleness, saying, \"0 Allah! We are <br>weak and helpless, and nothing can be achieved with- <br>out Your assistance; therefore, assist us in this sacred <br>cause. and divert the hearts of Your servants, to Your <br>true religion, and to the life hereafter, and let us be a <br>medium for this service. 0 Allah! Accept this humble <br>service of ours, and establish Your religion with it. 0 <br>Allah! Save us from the evil of those, whom we corltact <br>in this work of Tabligll, and also save them from the <br>evil of our self. Let then1 benefit from the good in our <br>souls, and let us benefit from the good in their souls! <br>(And one could say any other suitable du'aa, according <br>to the occasion). <br>6. <br>Do not be engaged in discussions with anyone, nor ar- <br>range any debate. <br>7. <br>During vour goirlg around for an informal or special <br>visit for Tabligh, take the local pious people with you, <br>so that they cdn see the impietv and transgression of <br>the people of their towrl with their own eves, and <br>should. consequentlv, join you in Tabligh work. <br>8. When you reach a certain city or village, meet the dis- <br>tinguished people thereof, and explain to them the <br>method and the aims and objects of Tabligh, and stress <br>the importance of religious preachment, and then <br>invite them to join the group. By the distinguished <br>people we mean the pious, or the wealthy persons, <br>who are, one way or another, influential in their city, <br>mohalla or village. One should be very cautious, <br>reasonable, and to the point, while talking to theni. <br>The invitation and the speech <br>Since your speech is not your real aim and object, and <br>is merely a medium of instruction, one should rather <br>stress the meaning and the purpose of your words, for <br>the sake of Tabligh. Make yourself clear to your listen- <br>ers, in simple and easy language. Do not adopt the <br>style of common orators, and do not talk about things, <br>which the listener would not understand. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallah) repeated every sentence of <br>his thrice, that his audience should understand it <br>easily. His words were spoken slowly and clearly, so <br>that the listeners could count them. <br>Six Fundamentals <br>In your speech you should explain the vanity of <br>worldly objects, and then the greatness and immortal- <br>ity of the boons and enjoyments in the life hereafter. <br>Instruct them to prepare for the life in the grave and to <br>do good deeds for the same; and then attain peace and <br>salvation on the Day of Qiyaamah; and then ask them <br>to live a pious life, for this will save them from the <br>punishment of Jahannam. Explain to them the impiety <br>and negligence of the present Muslims, particularly the <br>condition of local people, which you will come to <br>know during the going around for the informal and <br>special visits. <br>3. Tell them the spiritual and religious benefits of joining <br>the Tabligh group, and invite them to the same. <br>4. Explain to them the punishment for not inducing <br>people to good, and preventing them from evil, and tell <br>them the reward of being faithful to Islam, during this <br>era of sin and disobedience. <br>5. Do not adopt a tone of command and superiority, <br>while instructing people. <br>6. In every speech, one should advice the audience to be <br>practical about what they know of Islam. <br>Obedience to the leader <br>Every order of the leader should be obeyed, provided <br>he does not ask you to commit a sin. Yes, obey him, though <br>he is not so much educated as you are. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) has said in a hadith, \"If a leader has <br>been appointed to you, whose nose and ears are cut, you <br>should obey him, when he instructs you with the Holy <br>Qur'aan.\" <br>Sometimes the leader will bestow an honour, or the <br>right of speech, on a person inferior to you in status; in <br>such a case, you should not object to it, and raise no objec- <br>tion against him. Hadhrat Ubaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) says, \"We took a pledge at the hands of <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), that we should <br>obey him in prosperity and in calamity, in pleasure and <br>sorrow, and will not obey the suggestions of our evil self, <br>against his wish, and will not prefer ourselves to' others <br>against his choice; that we shall not try to snatch lead- <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>Six Fundamentals <br>ership from another; that we will s eak the truth, wherever <br>we are; that we will not mind t ! <br>e criticism of anyone, <br>while obeying the commandments of Allah\". <br>(Mishkaat Sharief) <br>The etiquette of taking meals <br>1. Wash your hands before and after meals, and wash <br>your mouth also. <br>2. Begin to take meals by saying; \"Bismillaah wa'alaa bar- <br>katillaah\". <br>3. Take your meals with your right hand. <br>4. Take the food that is in front of you, but if there are <br>various things in the utensil from which you )are <br>eating, then you may take it from wherever you please. <br>5. Place the food on a table cloth and then partake from <br>the food. <br>6. Do not eat from the centre of the utensil, for the bles- <br>sing of Allah descends at that point. <br>7. Finish all the food in the utensil, and do not spare any- <br>thing for the Shaytaan. When all the food is taken, the <br>utensil prays to Allah for your delivery from Jahan- <br>nam. <br>8. Lick your fingers before washing your hands, it is men- <br>tioned in a hadith, \"One does not know in which par- <br>ticle of the food is the blessing of Allah.\" <br>9. Take your meals with three fingers of the right hand. <br>20. If a morsel falls on the table cloth, pick it up and eat it, <br>and do not spare it for Shaytaan. <br>I <br>11. One should not lean on a cushion or arrogantly recline <br>whilst eating. <br>I <br>12. Do not object to the quality of food; if you like it, take <br>it otherwise don't take it, and keep silent. <br>13. All of you should take your meals, as a group, and not <br>separately. <br>CL <br>14. Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"I saw Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) taking his meals, in <br>a squatting pdsition.\" <br>Six Fundamentuls <br>15. If some companions are eating sweetmeats or dates to- <br>gether, do not take two pieces at a time, without their <br>permission. <br>I <br>16. If you forget to read \"Bismillaah\" at the beginning of <br>I <br>your meals, then say when you remember it, \"Bismil- <br>I <br>laahi awwaluhu wa aakhiruhu\", that is, with the name <br>of Allah in the beginning and at the end of it. <br>,<br>17. Do not eat onions while you are in the mosque, and if <br>you have eaten them out of the mosque, do not enter it, <br>until such time that there is no odour left. <br>i<br>I<br>18. When you have taken your meals, say, <br>Alkamdu lillaahil lathee at-'amanaa wasaqaanaa waja- <br>alanaa minal muslimeen. <br>\"All praise is due to Allah, who has nourisned us, and <br>has quenched our thirst, and has assisted us to be Mus- <br>lims.\" <br>19. First pick up the table cloth, and then get up. <br>20. Do not eat food which is too hot. <br>21. If you have eaten to your fill, do not get up before your <br>companions, but keep eating slowly; and if you have to <br>get up, excuse yourself, and ask them to continue. <br>22. If you drink water, milk or any other liquid say, \"Bis- <br>millaah\" at the beginning and \"Alhamdulillaah\" at the <br>end. <br>23. Do not drink continuously in one gulp, like a camel. <br>24. Do not breathe in a utensil nor blow into it. <br>25. If the utensil is broken or chipped at a certain point <br>then do not eat or drink from that point of the utensil. <br>26. Wash your mouth after drinking milk, and read this <br>du'aa, <br><br> <br>i <br>I <br>Six Fundamentals <br>Allaahumma baarik lanaa feehi wa zidnaa minhu. <br>\"0 Allah! let it be a blessing for us and increase it for <br>us\". <br>All these etiquettes of taking food and drink have been <br>quoted from Mishkaat Sharief. <br>The etiquette of going to sleep <br>1. Do not go to sleep without wudhu. <br>2. <br>Clean the bed thrice before going to sleep. <br>3. Lie on the bed on your right side, place your right <br>hand under your cheek, and read \"Allahumma be'is- <br>mika amooto wa ahyaa\". 0 Allah! In Your name do I <br>die and live. <br>4. <br>Read \"Aayatul Kursi\" and \"Aamanar Rasoolu (up to <br>the end of Surah) before going to sleep. <br>5. <br>Read \"Subhaanallah\", <br>\"Alhamdulillaah\" and \"Al- <br>laahu-Akbar\", thirty three times each, before going to <br>sleep. <br>6. Read all the four Surahs, beginning with \"Qul\", then <br>. blow on your hands, and apply them to your whole <br>body; do this thrice. <br>7. <br>Read Surah \"Alif laam meem sajdah\" and \"Tabarakal- <br>ladhi beyadihil mulk\" (up to the end of Surah) before <br>going to sleep. <br>8. When awakening read, <br>Alhamdu lillaahil lahee abaanaa ba'da maa amaata- <br>naa wa ilayhin nushoor. <br>\"All praise to Allah. He who revived us to life after <br>giving us death and to Him we shall have to return.\" <br>V) 3 <br>9. <br>Apply collyrium (surmah) to your eyes thrice, before <br>going to sleep. <br>.X E <br>cn a <br>10. If you want to get up for the Tahajjud prayer, read. \"In- <br>u <br>c <br>alladhina aamanu\" (Up to the end of Surah Kahaf). All <br>28 <br>Six Fundamentals <br>these etiquettes of sleeping have been quoted from the <br>ahaadith. <br>Wudhu and Salaah <br>1. If the time of salaah is near, then have wudhu before <br>proceeding on a journey, also take a Lota (utensil for <br>the purpose of wudhu) and a six yard rope, to draw <br>water from a well if the necessity arises. <br>2. The water from the station taps and that from the toil= <br>in the train is clean. If this water is not available then <br>only will Tayammum be permissible. <br>3. The time for Maghrib salaah begins after sunset and <br>ends when the redness in the sky disappears. The gen- <br>eral belief that Maghrib salaah cannot be performed a <br>short while after the sunset is incorrect. <br>4. If the distance of your journey is more than forty eight <br>miles (77,248 Kilometres) then instead of performing <br>four fardh rak'aats you should perforkal only two. <br>5. Do not postpone any prayer during the journey, for a <br>single postponement will render your journey useless. <br>If you have forgotten a certain prayer, or its time has <br>passed during your sleep, then perform it as soon as <br>possible, if the prayers of a journey are performed after <br>reaching home, then observe two rak'aat for Zuhr, As'r <br>and Esha: on the other hand, if the prayers postponed <br>at home, are performed during the journey, then ob- <br>serve them in a complete form (four rak'aats for Zuhr, <br>As'r and Esha). <br>6. There are many Muslims on whom Qadha salaah for <br>years was due. they are advised to perform these sa- <br>laahs as soon as possible, whilst on a Tabligh journey <br>the opportunities are numerous so perform as many <br>qadha salaahs as possible, rather perform the fardh <br>qadha, instead of the nawaafil. Remember that qadha <br>salaah is only performed for the fardh and Wit'r sa- <br>laahs. <br>7. The jamaat salaah (congregational prayer) is necessary <br>even during the Tabligh journey. When it is time for <br>salaah, say the adhaan (the call to prayer) and then <br>perform the salaah with jamaat, and say takbeer before <br>I <br>~ <br>I <br>I <br>f<br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>the same. If all the members cannot perform the salaah <br>in a group, then let them perform it in pairs. <br>8. If you are in a hurry, then you may omit the sunnats <br>before and after the fardh salaah, but not those of the <br>Faj'r salaah. And if you are not in a hurry, then per- <br>form all the Sunnats. <br>9. If you have put your luggage in a railway compartment <br>or in a bus, and it is about to depart, then terminate the <br>salaah. Perform the same, salaah in the train or vehicle <br>if it is possible. <br>10. To face the qiblah is necessary even in a railway com- <br>partment, therefore perform your salaah in the correct <br>direction; and if you do not know the direction of the <br>qiblah, nor is there anyone to show you, then establish <br>the same by careful estimation. If the train or vehicle <br>takes a turn, while you are performing the salaah, then <br>turn yourself accordingly. <br>11. Even if the train is moving it is fardh for you to stand <br>and complete your salaah. If you are healthy and <br>strong enough to stand, then do not sit for the salaah. <br>One can easily perform the salaah in the passage or in <br>between the seats, moreover you can perform the <br>salaah in pairs with jamaat in the space between the <br>two rows of seats. <br>1. Every member of the Tabligh group is responsible for <br>his expenditure during the journey. <br>2. Be courteous and polite to every Muslim whom you <br>meet during your journey. Be courteous to the non- <br>Muslims also, and show them Islamic manners. If you <br>I <br>sometimes talk to them, tell them that humanity is gen- <br>f;i <br>erally negligent of Allah, therefore they must submit to <br>~ <br>Him for their salvation. <br>3. When you reach a certain destination, consult the local <br>inhabitants, before you start your work of Tablih. <br>, <br>- <br>4. When you reach a city or a town, or a village, do not <br>stay anywhere except in the musjid, even though <br>I <br>someone may insist on doing otherwise. <br>el <br>5. Extinguish the lamp or the light of the musjid where <br>Six Fundamentals <br>you stay, at the normally fixed times, for it is not cor- <br>rect to use it for yourself only. Extinguish the lights <br>after Esha salaah, when the musallies (worshippers) <br>have departeg; then light a candle of your own, if it be <br>needed. <br>6. Do not ask for any bedding from the people of that <br>place; anyhow help one another if there is a shortage of <br>beds: nor ask for any utensils. <br>7. Fix a fee before engaging any labourer: if you employ <br>any labourer without fixing a fee, then pay him his full <br>remuneration. If you pay him less than the local rate, <br>and he is unhappy, and kept asking for more, until he <br>went away disappointed, then you will have to pay <br>him on the Day of Qiyaamah. Remember. oppression <br>or forced agreement co~lcerning fixing a fee before <br>engaging any labourer is not recognized: therefore if <br>anyone gives up his right by oppression, then the op- <br>pressor can not be forgiven by that person. <br>8. Avoid every kind of useless talk during your Tabligh <br>journey, and be cautious of everything you do. In short <br>spend your time carefully during this journey, and pay <br>special gttention to the Tabligh work. Do not talk <br>much, nor laugh unnecessarily, for it is mentioned in a <br>hadith, \"Too much talk hardens your heart, and too <br>much laughing kills your heart. and the noor of your <br>face is lessened. <br>9. Every action of yours must be based on sincerity, and <br>you should not despair the reward from Allah. In <br>whatever you do you must make a good niyyat (inten- <br>tion). <br>10. Make your return journey also a Tabligh journey, and <br>on your way home, observe the same as you observed <br>while going abroad. <br>v <br>11. All the requisites of Islamic etiquette that you learnt <br>during the journey, and all the salaahs that you per- <br>formed, should be maintained at home also. Humble- <br>ness in salaah, constant zikr service to humanity, <br>sincerity and all the good actions that 'you practised <br>during the journey, should be observed at home also, <br>for the main object of this journey was to involve one- <br>self in the practice of good deeds. <br>; <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>12. If vou undertake a journey for worldly objects, and not <br>purely for Tabligh work, even then observe Islamic eti- <br>quette and du'aas; perform your salaahs regularly, with <br>Jama'at and if there are three companions, one of them <br>should be made an ameer. <br>In such a Tabligh journey keep all the books of Tabligh <br>with you, namely Hikaayaat-i-Sahaabah, Fadhaa'il <br>Namaaz, Fadhaa'il Tabligh etc., and you should also <br>have a miswak, lota (utensil for holding water for the <br>purpose of wudhu), musallah (prayer mat), soap, <br>thread and needle, table cloth, mud lump made for the <br>purpose of istinja, matches, candle, comb, surmah <br>daani (surmah dispenser), torch, staff (which could be <br>used as a sutrah). <br>14. If the leader asks you to prepare food for the group, or <br>to do some other service, obey his orders happily; and <br>don't think that you will be deprived of the reward of <br>Tabligh when your companions leave you with your <br>task, for then you will deserve double reward, one for <br>rendering service to your companions, and the other, <br>for relieving your companions of their worry to enable <br>them to do Tabligh work freely. <br>15. The Tabligh journey is a good period in which to prac- <br>tice Islamic routine; therefore, be heIpful to one an- <br>other, and promote unity. Don't insist on your own <br>proposdl, but only suggest it, and explain the merits. If <br>your companions do not accept your proposal, then <br>don't despair; If the proposal of somebody else is ac- <br>cepted by the group, and the result is not good, then <br>don't say. \"What did I suggest to you? Had you ob- <br>served my counsel, you would have attained much <br>good!\" <br>16. During the informal or special visit, or during Taalim <br>lessons, or at the time of da'wat don't discuss any con- <br>troversial subject; but should rather invite people to <br>the fundamentals of Islam and the Oneness of Allah, <br>for when one understands the meaning of the kalimah, <br>then he will want to know more about Imaan and <br>Islam. <br>I <br>i <br>17. Remain in any city or village that you visit as long as <br>its inhabitants can easily understand the main object of <br>the work of Tabligh, and are prepared to observe all <br>32 <br>Six Fundamentals <br>the rules of T&!igh work. It is not correct to be at one <br>place in the morning, at another in the evening; at one <br>place at Zuh'r, and at another as As'r. One cannot do <br>justice to Tabligh work, if you-visit only a few persons, <br>or deliver a speech in the musjid. Your attempt in this <br>task can be successful and impressive only when you <br>stay in a town for a required period. <br>18. When you return from a journey, and are nearing your <br>city or village, say, <br>Aa-iboona, taa-iboona, 'aabidoona lirabbinaa haami- <br>doon. <br>\"We are returning (to piety); we are repenting; we are <br>worshipping Allah; and we are giving thanks to <br>Allah!'' <br>19. When you return from the journey, and enter your <br>home, say, <br>Owban, owban, lirabbinaa towban, laa yughaadiru <br>alaynaa hpwban. <br>\"I have returned, I have returned to my Sustainer with <br>repentence, which would cleanse us of every sin\". <br>20. It is preferable to reach your town after sunrise; then <br>perform two rakaats nafl in the local musjid, then talk <br>to your Muslim brothers for a while, and then enter <br>your home. Whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) returned from a journey he did so. (Mish- <br>kaat ) <br>21. Whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) re- <br>turned from a journey during the night, he did not <br>enter his home, but on the next morning or evening. <br>(Mishkaat). <br>22. It has been reported by Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When- <br>ever you return from a journey after sunset, and wish <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>tcl go home to your wife, then give her sufficient time <br>to remove pubic hair and to comb the hair on her head <br>(in order that she groom herself in preparation for your <br>return). (Bukhaari & Muslim) <br>23. After returning from a journey, one should hastely <br>rejoin the Tabligh workers, successful and fortunate is <br>he who observes the requisites of this journey sin- <br>cerely, and returns home with a great spiritual im- <br>provement. <br>Directives for the workers of Tabligh <br>(Selected from the sayings of Hadhrat Maulana Muhammad <br>Ilyaas (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>1. The first and the main object of knowledge is that one <br>should examine his actions; he should realize his <br>duties and shortcomings, and should seek means to <br>overcome them. Then if you only compare the actions <br>of others according to your ilm then this pride destroys <br>those who have ilm. <br>2. The real remembrance of Allah is that a Muslim <br>should always obey the commandments of Allah, and <br>should keep them in mind at all times. I instruct my <br>own friend with the same zikr. <br>3. The main object of our jamaat is to teach the Muslims <br>the original and complete religion taught by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). This is our real object; as <br>for our Tabligh journeys in groups this is a preliminary <br>means to carry out our work; the instruction of Kali- <br>mah Tayyibah and Salaah is the initiation of our course. <br>4. Our workers should remember that if their da'wat is not <br>accepted anywhere, they should not be disappointed: <br>they should remember that they generally are follow- <br>ing the Sunnah of the Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam) <br>and particularly the Sunnah of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). How many are there who go out in <br>Allah's path, who bear hardships and yet are dis- <br>graced? On the other hand, if they are welcomed and <br>honoured somewhere, they should think it to be a <br>favour of Allah, and should have great regard for it. <br>When they teach religion to those who pay heed to it, <br>though they be commoners, they thank Allah for His <br>favour. <br>Six Fundamen tals <br>5. Our workers should not desire for calamities from <br>Allah. Should any misfortune befall them then, they <br>should accept that to be the mercy of Allah, and a com- <br>pensation for their sins, and as a means to raise their <br>ranks. <br>6. In your explanation you should have the intention to <br>please Allah only, and not your audience. In the Tab- <br>ligh journey we should bear in mind that we have left <br>our homes in obedience to Allah's command, and not <br>by our own wish; therefore it is He who will assist us. <br>When you have such an intention, you will not be ang- <br>ered by the i.11 treatment of the people to whom you <br>talk, nor will you be discouraged. <br>7. It has become an undesirable custom, if our audience <br>does not follow our instructions we regard ourselves to <br>be loosers, whereas it is infact the loss to our listeners, <br>because they have not obeyed the teachings of their re- <br>ligion, our success lies in performing our duty to de- <br>liver the truth. How can we be unsuccessful, by the <br>negligence of others? Our duty is to present Islam in <br>the best possible manner. Even the Ambiyaa fAlayhi- <br>mus salaam) were not held responsible, if the audience <br>did not follow them. You may learn a lesson from <br>peoples rejection, that your approach to this work may <br>not be perfect and faultless; therefore, you shall im- <br>prove your future attempts and ask Allah for complete <br>guidance. <br>8. If the Ulama and pious people of a town show no keen- <br>ness and are not sympathetic towards the work of Tab- <br>ligh, then do not doubt their sincerity, and don't <br>develop any ill feeling about them in your heart, but <br>you should realize that the object of the work is not <br>apparent to them yet. <br>9. Wherever you go, you should visit the Ulama and <br>pious people of that place, so that you can benefit from <br>their knowledge and piety. You should not invite them <br>to the work of Tabligh, for they know their duties best, <br>and the benefits thereof; they will not understand the <br>object of your work merely by explanation, therefore, <br>they will naturally not confirm the same, and once <br>they do not acknowledge, they shall insist on their <br>denial, hence meet them only for your benefit, as long <br>as you are in their town make an effort to follow your <br>I <br>I<br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>lessons and principles very strictly; when the ulama <br>and pious ones are informed of your activities, they <br>will naturally be interested in your Tabligh work; <br>thereafter in a very honourable and respectful manner <br>explain to them your aims and objects. <br>10. One of the principles of Tabligh is that a speaker <br>should be concise and to the point in his general ad- <br>dress but very polite and courteous, when addressing a <br>particular person; rather when he instructs a particular <br>person, even then his address should be of a general <br>nature. Whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) came to know of the wrong actions of a particular <br>person, he disapproved of it in general terms and said, <br>\"What will the result of such a nation be, who commit <br>wrong actio-ns\". <br>11. We are accustomed to be pleased with talk only; we <br>merely talk about good deeds, and think that our <br>words replace them; therefore, try to refrain from this <br>habit. <br>12. Whatever good deeds you do, attribute them to Allah, <br>and seek His forgiveness for verily you should keep in <br>mind that whatever action you did was not the best, <br>and that there was fault in its completion. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to seek Allah's for- <br>giveness at the end of his salaah. The responsibility of <br>Allah's work cannot be completed in anyway by His <br>servants, and when we are busy with certain work this <br>should not stop us from doing other work, and we <br>should seek Allah's forgiveness and assistance at the <br>completion of all good work. <br>13. All your Tabligh journeys will be worthless if you did <br>not continue studying deeni ilm and regular zikrullah, <br>hence, there is fear that negligence of these two essen- <br>I <br>tials could be a cause of turmoil, and to be led astray. If <br>you do not possess deeni ilm then Islam and Imaan is <br>for name sake and customary, for no good deed is poss- <br>ible without sound Islamic knowledge, and knowledge <br>without zikrullah is but darkness and no noor can be <br>v, <br>derived therefrom, and this is what our workers have <br>neglected. <br>.5 E <br>14. When a deeni explanation is made and also during the * 4 <br>gasht the jamaat members are taught to remain in zik- <br>E <br>a <br>k <br>Six Fundamentals <br>rullah and fikr. The reason for this is whilst an effort is <br>made to explain the truth and at the same time many <br>hearts in the group are occupied in endorsing with a <br>firm belief, the same idea, this makes an impression on <br>other hearts. <br>15. The proportion of zikrullah must be increased concert- <br>edly to outweigh the unfavourable and adverse con- <br>ditions the jamaat encounters when going out for <br>Tabligh. This will protect them from the evil effects of <br>the human and jinn shayaateen. <br>16. Sincerity and good intention is the base of Tabligh <br>work, and steadfastness of the abovementioned is very <br>important. Therefore, Tabligh workers should at all <br>times seek Allah's pleasure and obey His commands, <br>the greater the extent there is in your sincerity and <br>steadfastness, the greater will be your reward with <br>Allah. <br>17. The end of your good actions should always be a con- <br>fession of your weakness and negligence, and the fear <br>of that deed not being accepted by Allah. <br>18. In our Tabligh work in addition to both sincerity and <br>truthfulness, unity and mutual consultation is essen- <br>tial. Without these a great danger of committing errors <br>prevails. <br>19. Those high positions which Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) showed, that could be attained by <br>love and dedication of deen and which was also at- <br>tained by the Sahaabah (Radhiyallaho anhum) for their <br>sacrifices and hardships which they underwent, you <br>wish to attain that status by the mere leasurely reading <br>of books. For those lofty favours and rewards that were <br>obtained through total sacrifice, we should at least <br>sweat a bit. <br>20. What benefit is there in remembering the duties which <br>have been completed. One should plan the completion <br>of the remainder of the mission, and assess the short- <br>comings of the work done. <br>21. Don't be contented with a person's accepting or under- <br>standing your message, be mindful of how many mil- <br>lions are left out +a whom Allah's message did not <br>reach. How many more are there who accepted and <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>3 7 <br>were aware of your message but due to our negligence <br>did not carry out Allah's command. <br>22. Many are of the view that to convey the message is <br>Tabligh, this is a serious misunderstanding. The mean- <br>ing of Tabligh is that a person should according to his <br>ability and experience convey the message of deen in a <br>manner, that there is hope for the people to accept <br>what is being said. This was the method practiced by <br>the Ambiyaa (Alayhimus salaam). <br>23. Those who go out for deeni work or for gasht, and their <br>hearts are effected by meeting unmindful and negligent <br>people or irreligious'places should make good this loss <br>by zikrullah and fikr of the Deen in seclusion. <br>24. Basically, every good deed is for the pleasure of Allah <br>and to gain reward in the Hereafter. Worldly gains <br>should also be mentioned for encouragement towards <br>piety. At the beginning, some do religious work for <br>worldly gain, but due to the blessing of the work they <br>are later favoured by Allah with sincerity. <br>25. Plan, suggest and propose ways and means to call <br>people towards Deen and doing the work of Deen. Ap- <br>proach them in a manner that will draw their atten- <br>tion, and attract them towards Deen. <br>26. The purpose to go out for Tabligh journeys is not <br>merely to advice and guide others, infact the object is <br>to reform ourselves and develop pleasant habits. <br>Hence, during the journey we should be engaged at all <br>times with zikrullah and aquiring deeni ilm. These <br>should be practiced with the advice and guidance of <br>our learned elders and Ameer (leader). Be mindful of <br>these for your going out for Tabligh will be futile if <br>these are neglected. <br>27. In this work of Tabligh firm establishment is more sig- <br>nificant than expansion. The method of this is that <br>with establishment, expansion must be simultaneous. <br>Without travelling to villages, towns and countries, <br>how could this work of Tabligh be established. <br>.- <br>28. One of the principles of this Tabligh work is that one <br>abstains from unilateral decisions and freedom of <br>.a 8 <br>movement, and at all times abides to the guidance of * <br>the recognized learned elders. <br>3 k <br><br>3 8 <br>Six Fundamentals <br>29. The general practice of Tabligh workers is that they <br>give full attention to the more prominent personalities, <br>and are less attentive towards other pious and humble <br>not well to do persons who offer their services. It must <br>be understood that this is an approach totally for <br>worldly gain. Keep in mind that the pious and humble <br>who are very poor and needy, who offer their services <br>out of dedication for guidance, are a blessing from <br>Allah. Therefore honour and be grateful to them. <br>30. Womenfolk should assist the men and give them the <br>opportunity to do religious work. Make their house- <br>hold duties lighter for them so that they may do relig- <br>ious work withaut any hinderance. If the women do <br>not co-operate in this direction, they will be the vic- <br>tims of becoming a trap of Shaytaan. <br>31. It is very important when one goes out for Tabligh <br>work that one remains occupied in the activities of the <br>jamaat, and does not get involved in other things. The <br>work schedule of the jamaat is as follows: (1) To go <br>around meeting Muslims for the upliftment of Deen. <br>(2) The acquiring of deeni ilm, and the development of <br>a habit of constant zikrullah. (3) To be helpful, particu- <br>larly to your close associates. (4) The correction of in- <br>tention and working towards the development of <br>Ikhlaas (sincerity) and exercising Ihtisaab, i.e. with a <br>concerted effort of keeping ones self under serveilance <br>for purity and clarity of niyyah. One must also regu- <br>larly entrench the thought in your heart that ones <br>going out is solely for the pleasure of Allah alone, <br>therefore one will definately be blessed with the prom- <br>ise in the Qur'aan and hadith for dedication ornate <br>with this refined quality. It is this Ikhlaas that is kept <br>in check by Ihtisaab which is termed true Imaan, and <br>is also the essence of all our deeds. <br>32. The Shaytaan's desire is to annul and destroy the pro- <br>gress and higher position which would be attained by <br>being punctual with the faraa'idh, therefore all ones <br>free moments must be spent in nafl zikr (optional zikr), <br>so that the Shaytaan is unable to influence you into <br>meaningless things which would result in harm. <br>33. One of the principles of Tabligh work is that you <br>honour every Muslim and respect the Ulama. <br><br>Six Fundamentals <br>34. Understand that when some companions intend re- <br>turning home, don't desire or yearn to follow them, <br>rather contain your heartfelt desire and continue with <br>Tabligh work, for great virtues have been promised for <br>the same. The example of those who contain their <br>heartfelt desire and remain steadfast on this work is <br>that of a fighter who remains fighting on the battlefield <br>whilst his co-fighters disappear in retreat. <br>I <br>35. The condition preceeding the assured method of at- <br>taining Allah's assistance is that you should assist His <br>true religion. If you offer assistance to His deen then <br>difficulties alld obstacles in life will turn into means <br>for your pleasure in this world, and the earth and skies <br>and whatever it contains will be of assistance to you. <br>Those who after carrying out Allah's work despair the <br>I <br>mercy and pleasure of Allah would be most unfortu- <br>nate and wilfully transgressing His laws. <br>36. What is termed to be divine assistance and unforseen <br>power is not bestowed initially but is disseminated at <br>the appropriate occasion and time.</p></div>"

Then I hoke <br>the shackles that had kept me away from Allah, and set <br>out on His path to seek His pleasure.'' <br>Such is the case with religious books. A cursory reading of <br>these seldom produces the desired effect, and a frequent <br>and thorough study thereof is therefore necessary. <br>For the convenience of the readers, and to interest <br>them, I have divided this book into the following twelve <br>chapters together with an epilogue. <br>Chapter I Steadfastness in the face of hardships. <br>Chapter I1 Fear of Allah. <br>Chapter I11 Abstinence and Contentment. <br>Chapter IV Piety and Scrupulousness. <br>Chapter V Devotion to Salaat. <br>Chapter VI Sympathy and Self-sacrifice and spending <br>in the path of Allah. <br>Chapter VII Valour and Heroism. <br>Chapter VIII Zeal for knowledge. <br>Chapter IX Ready Compliance with the Prophet's <br>Wishes. <br>Chapter X The Women's love of Faith and their Cour- <br>age. <br>Chapter XI The Children's Devotion to Islam. <br>Chapter XI1 Love and Devotion for the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam). <br>The Epilogue: ~ahabah's Virtues and Privileges. <br><br>CHAPTER I <br>STEADFASTNESS IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIPS <br>It is really very hard for the Muslims of to-day to <br>imagine, and much less to endure or even to attempt to <br>endure, the hardships that were borne by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his illustrious compan- <br>ions in the path of Allah. Books of history are full of stories <br>of their sufferings. It is a pity that we are so indifferent to <br>those events and our knowledge is so poor in this regard. I <br>open this chapter with a story about the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself to get the blessings of Allah, <br>which are sure to attend his auspicious mention. <br>I. \t The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe Wasallam) Journey to <br>Taif <br>For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His <br>mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been <br>delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all- <br>efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a <br>few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped <br>him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca <br>left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and <br>his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those good- <br>hearted people who helped him, in spife of his not entering <br>into the fold of Islam. <br>The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, the Qu- <br>reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinis- <br>ter pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the sec- <br>ond biggest town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan <br>strong in number. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, <br>thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the <br>Qureysh, and also establishing a base forxthe future propa- <br>gation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited the three chief- <br>tains of the clan separately, and placed before each of them <br>the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his <br>Propher's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of ac- <br>cepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and. <br>notwithstanding the proverbial Arab hospitality. each of <br>them treated him most contemptuously a11d rudely. They <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>plainly told him that they did not like his stay in their <br>town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had ex-<br>pected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in <br>speech from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But <br>one of them sneered: <br>\"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" <br>The other exclaimed with derision: <br>\"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, beside <br>you to make him His Prophet?\" <br>The third one gibed at him: <br>\"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are in fact a <br>Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and if <br>you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an <br>impostor?\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a <br>rock of steadfastness and perseverance, did not lose heart <br>over this check from the chieftains, and tried to approach <br>the common people; but nobody would listen to him. <br>Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town <br>and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that fur- <br>ther efforts were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But <br>they would not let him depart in peace, and set the street <br>urc.hins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone <br>Iiirn. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole <br>body was covered with blood, and his shoes were clogged <br>to his feet. He left the town in this woeful plight. When he <br>cvns far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, he prayed <br>to Allah thus: <br>- 0  <br>,*i u',<br>Fj,k @, 3 219, <br>t & qj &J' <br>-,$i <br>\"0,my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of <br>my strength, of my lack of resources and my being <br><br>17 / <br>'8% <br>unimportant in the eyes of people. 0,Most Merciful of <br>8 a <br>all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord <br>of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom art <br>Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who <br>would sullenly frown at me, or to an alien to whom <br>Thou hast given control over my affairs? Not in the <br>least do I care for anything except that I may have Thy <br>protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the <br>light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all <br>sorts of darkness, and which controls all affairs in this <br>world as well as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I <br>should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should be dis- <br>pleased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy dis- <br>pleasure till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor <br>power but through Thee.\" <br>The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail <br>(Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum <br>and said: <br>\"Allah knows all that has passed between you and <br>these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the <br>mountains to be at your command.\" <br>Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered the angel <br>before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel <br>greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If you wish, <br>I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on <br>both sides to collide with each other, so that all the <br>people therein would be crushed to death, or you may <br>suggesTany other punishment for them.\" <br>The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said: <br>\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope <br>from Allah that there will be persons from among their <br>progeny who would worship Allah and serve His <br>cause.\" <br>Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam], whom we profess to follow! We get so <br>much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from <br>somebody that we keep on torturing and taking our revenge <br>throughout our lives in every possible manner. Does it <br>become people who claim to follow the magnanimous <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even after so <br>much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither <br>curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when <br>he has the full opportunity to do so. <br>2. \t<br>Martyrdom of Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) was one <br>of the Sahabah who could not take part in the campaign of <br>Badr. He very much regretted to have missed the honour of <br>participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for <br>Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make <br>amends for Badr. He did not have to wait for long. The <br>battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined <br>the army with the most determined zeal. Despite heavy <br>odds, the Muslims were gaining the upper hand, when <br>some people made a blunder and the Muslims had to suffer <br>a reverse. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>posted a band of fifty archers to guard a pass in the rear <br>against the enemy cavalry. They had definite instructions <br>not to move from their position till further orders from <br>him. But when they saw the Muslims gaining victory and <br>the enemy in full flight, they left their position in the belief <br>that the battle was over and it was time to join in the pur- <br>suit and get on to the booty. The leader of the band tried <br>his utmost to check them by reminding them of the <br>Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) command and sol- <br>icited them to stay on, but no more than ten persons would <br>listen to him, arguing that the orders given by the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were only for the duration of <br>the actual fight. Th'e enemy cavalry then noticed the un- <br>guarded pass in the rear, made a flank movement, forced a <br>passage through it, and fell right on the rear of the Mus- <br>lims, who were pre-occupied with the booty. It was in this <br>state of affairs that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) saw <br>Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az (Radhiyallaho anho) passing in <br>front of him. He shouted to him: <br>\"0,Sa'ad! where are you going? Bv Allah! I smell the <br>fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\" <br>Saying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the <br>enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyr- <br>dom. <br>After the battle, it was found that his body had been <br>mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister <br><br>could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. <br>No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were <br>counted on his body. <br>Those who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity <br>and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this <br>world, and so did Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) smell the fra- <br>grance of Paradise. <br>3. \t The Truce of Hudeybiah and Story of Hadhrat Abu <br>Jandal and Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anhu- <br>ma) <br>In the 6th year of Hijrah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) along with his companions left for Mecca to per- <br>form Umrah. The Qureysh heard of the news and decided <br>to resist his entry into Mecca even as a pilgrim, and so he <br>had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted Sahabah, 1 400 <br>in number, were however determined to enter, even if it <br>involwd an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the <br>Sahabah's eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the <br>Qureysh, accepting their conditions in full. <br>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a <br>very bitter pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devo- <br>tion to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not <br>allow them to demur, and even the most valiant man like <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) could not but submit to <br>his decision. According to one of the articles of the treaty, <br>converts to Islam during the period of the truce were to be <br>returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to <br>Qureysh. <br>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in <br>Mecca, was suffering great persecution at the hands of <br>Qureysh. They kept him constantly in chains. On hearing <br>about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to <br>reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about <br>to be signed. His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) <br>was the envoy of Qureysh in the negotiations for the truce. <br>He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) on his <br>face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the <br>truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu <br>Jandal's case was premature. Suhail, however, would not <br>listen to any argument and was not inclined to leave his</p></div>"

Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice <br>but, much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Salalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) agreed to his return. He however en- <br>joined patience on him saying: <br>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyalla- <br>ho anho), Allah will shortly open a way for you.\" <br>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallamj had returned to Madinah, another Meccan <br>Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to <br>Madinah and besought the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference to <br>the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons <br>who had been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, <br>however, advised him as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jan- <br>dal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient and to hope for the <br>help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, <br>Hadhrat Abp Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of <br>them: <br>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\" <br>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and <br>said: <br>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so <br>many persons. Ybu can have a look at it.\" <br>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner <br>and killed him. The other man took to his heels and reach- <br>ed Madinah to report to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam). In the meantime Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and <br>absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no <br>obligations to fulfil and I managed my escape from <br>them by this trick, as I was afraid of their forcing me to <br>forsake my faith.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Steadfastness in the Face of Hardships <br>The Projhet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: <br>\"You are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Basir [Radhiyallaho anho) came to under- <br>stand from this that he would be returned to Qureysh again <br>when they demanded him. He therefore left Madinah and <br>fled to a place in the desert on the sea shore. Abu Jandal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape and joined <br>him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few <br>days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the <br>wilderness. They had to undergo untold sufferings in the <br>desert. where there was neither habitation nor vegetation. <br>They, however, being bound by no treaty proved a great <br>nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing blows after blows on <br>their caravans passing that way. This compelled the Qu-<br>reysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Mad- <br>inah, so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty <br>like other Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. <br>It is said that Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was <br>on his death bed when the letter sent by the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting his return to Madinah <br>reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's (Sallalla- <br>ho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand. <br>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his <br>faith, provided it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given <br>an assurance to help those who are genuine Muslims. <br>4. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) and his Sufferings: <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is one of the best <br>known of the galaxy of Sahabah as moazzin of the Proph- <br>et's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) masjid. He was an Abys- <br>sinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Is- <br>lam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, <br>therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummay ah bin Khalaf , <br>who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie <br>down on the burning sand at midday and would place a <br>heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a <br>limb. He would then say to him: <br>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\" <br>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>would exclaim:- <br>\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, <br>made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make <br>him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from <br>wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu <br>Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in <br>afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat <br>Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he be- <br>came a free Muslim. <br>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty <br>Creator, ,while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many <br>gods and goddesses with minor godlings, therefore Bilal <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) repeated: <br>\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\" <br>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so <br>dear to him that no amount of persecution could distract <br>him from reciting His Holy name. It is said that the urchins <br>of Mecca would drag him in the streets, with his words <br>\"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing in their wake. <br>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to <br>have the honour of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He <br>was always to remain with him at home and abroad to call <br>out the Azabn for his Salaat. After the Prophet's death it <br>became very1 hard for him to continue his stay in Madinah <br>where he would miss him at every step and in every cor- <br>ner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest <br>of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to <br>him: <br>\"0,<br>Bilal! How irs it that you never visit me.\" <br>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On <br>reaching there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhuma) (The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) grandsons) requested him to call out the Azaan. He <br>could not refuse them, for they were very dear to him. But <br>as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of Madinah <br>cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the hap- <br>py old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>time. Even the women came out of their houses weeping. <br>Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) Ieft Madinah again after <br>a few days and died in Damascus in 20 A.H. <br><br>d a<br>ad c <br>0.p <br>5. <br>Hadhrat Abuzsr Ghifari's (Radhiysllaha anho) Con-<br>-84 <br>s m<br>version to Islam: <br>cA <br>Hadhrat Abuzar Ghifari (Radhiyallaho anho) is very <br>famous among the Sahabah for his piety and knowledge. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) used to say: <br>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other <br>~ e o p l eare incapable of acquiring.\" <br>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca <br>and make investigations regarding 'the person' who <br>claimed to be the recipient of Divine revelation. His brother <br>returned after necessary enquiries, and informed him that <br>he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to be a <br>man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his <br>wonderful revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-say- <br>ings. This report did not satisfy him, and he decided to set <br>out for Mecca and find out the facts for himself. On reach- <br>ing Mecca, he went straight to the Haram. He did not know <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and he did not <br>consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing <br>at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it <br>became dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him <br>and seeing in him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hos- <br>pitality and care for :he travellers, the poor and the strang- <br>ers, were the Sahabah's second nature. He, therefore, took <br>him to his place. He did not ask him about the purpose of <br>his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>himself disclose it. Next day, he again went to the Haram <br>and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn <br>who the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact <br>everybody knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and his companions were being persecuted in Mecca, <br>and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might have had misgiv- <br>ings about the result of his quest for the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>took him home for the night, but again did not have any <br>talk with him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On <br>the third night, however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) had entertained him as on the two previous nights, <br>he asked him: <br>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" <br>Before replying, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyal!aho anho) took <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>an undertaking from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>he would speak the truth, and then he enquired from him <br>about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallain). Hadhrat <br>Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany me <br>tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to <br>be very careful, lest people come to know of your asso- <br>ciation with me, and you get into trouble. When on our <br>way I apprehend some trouble, I shall get aside pre- <br>tending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, and you <br>will proceed ahead without stcgping so that the people <br>may not connect us.\" <br>The next day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), who took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). In the very first meeting, he embraced Islam. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), fearing that the <br>Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon him not to make <br>an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to go back <br>to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper <br>hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master of my <br>soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of <br>these unbelievers.\" <br>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right <br>in the midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, <br>recited Shahadah viz: <br>\"I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I <br>bear witness that Muhammad (Sallaliaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is the Prophet of Allah.\" <br>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten <br>him to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till <br>then embraced Islam) had not shielded him and saved him <br>from death. Abbas said to the mob: <br>\"Do you know who he is? He belongs to the Ghifar <br>clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If <br>he is killed, they will waylay us and we shall not be <br>able to trade with that country.\" <br>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone.</p></div>"

Can the annals of history <br>produce a parallel to such love and devotion? <br>IC1 <br>11. Sahabah's Love For the Prophet [Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and other Anecdotes. <br>Somebody asked Ali (Radhiyallaho anho): <br>\"How much was the Sahabah's love for the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>He replied: <br>\"By Allah! To us the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) was dearer than our riches, our children and our <br>mothers, and was more cherishable than a drink of <br>cold water at the time of severest thirst.\" <br>There is no exaggeration kn Ali's (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>statement. As a matter of fact, the Sahabah reached this <br>state because of the perfection of their Iman. It could not be <br>otherwise, in the face of what Allah has enjoined viz: <br>\"Say! If your fathers and your sons and your brethren <br>and your wives and your tribe and the wealth you have <br>acquired and the merchandise, for which you fear that <br>there will be no sale, and the dwellings you desire are <br>dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striv- <br>ing in His way, then wait till Allah bringeth His com- <br>mand to pass. Allah guideth not the wrong-doing<br>folk.\" <br>(IX: 24). <br>This verse sounds a note of warning against anything else <br>becoming more attractive than the love of Allah and that of <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Anas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) report <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>\"None of you can be a Mo'min until his love-for me is <br>more than his love for his parents, children and all the <br>people of the marld.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>'Ulama say that the love mentioned in this Hadith and <br>others of its kind is the voluntary love and not instinctive <br>love. If, however, it is taken to mean the natural and in- <br>stinctive love, then the word Mo'min will denote the Iman <br>of the highest degree, for instance that of Sahabah. <br>Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he heard from the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). \"There are three <br>things which when found in a person enable him to taste <br>the sweetness of real Iman. These are: <br>(1) When Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) are dearer to him than anything else in <br>this world. <br>(2) \t When his love for anyone is solely for the pleasure <br>of Allah, and <br>(3) \t When turning to 'Kufr' is as abhorrent to him as <br>being flung into the fire.\" <br>12. \t Miscellaneous Stories About Sahabah's Love for the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>(1)'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"0Prophet of Allah, you are dearer to me <br>than anybody else in the world except my <br>own self.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"No body can be a perfect Momin until I am <br>dearer to him than even his own self.\" <br>t <br>'Umar: \t<br>\"Now you are dearer to me than my own <br>self.\" <br>The Prophet: \t \"Now, O'Umar.\" <br>The 'Ulama have given two meanings to the conclud- <br>ing words of the Prophet viz: <br>(i) \"Now you have the real Iman.\" <br>(ii) \"Why is it that it is only now that \t I am dearer to <br>you than your own self? This should have been so <br>long ago.\" <br>Suhail Tastari (Rahmatullah alaih) says: <br>\"No one can have the relish of Sunnat until he takes <br>1 <br>i <br>I <br>f i <br>I <br>I <br>i <br>I</p></div>"

Fatimah's (Radhiyallaho anha) <br>house was at some distance from the Prophet's. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to her: <br>\"Would that you were living near me.\" <br>Fatimah: <br>\"Harithah's house is close by. If you ask him to ex- <br>change his house with mine. he will very gladly do it.\" <br>The Prophet: <br>\"He has already exchanged once on my request. I feel<br>shy to request him again.\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>But Harithah (Radhiyallaho anho) somehow came to know <br>that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) likes Fatimah <br>(Radhiyallaho anha) to live near him. He at once came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have come to know that you <br>wish Fatimah to live near you. Here are my houses at <br>your disposal. No other house is closer to yours than <br>these. Fatimah can have her house exchanged with any <br>of these. 0,Prophet of Allah, what you accept from me <br>is dearer to me than what you leave for me.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted the <br>offer, saying: <br>\"I know you are quite sincere in what you say\", and <br>gave him his blessings. <br>(4) A person came to the Prophet,[Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! You are dearer to me than my <br>life, my wealth and my family. When I am at my house <br>and happen to think of you, I become restless till I <br>come and see you. 0,Prophet of Allah, death ismre to <br>come to both of us. After death, you will be in your <br>exalted position as a Prophet, while I shall be some- <br>where else and perhaps I may not be able to see you. I <br>am very anxious and distressed when I think of this <br>separation from you.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this and he did not know what to say; then Jibra'eel <br>(Alayhis Salaam) appeared and revealed the following <br>verse: <br>\"Whoso obeyeth Allah and the Prophet, they are with <br>those unto whom Allah has shown favour among the <br>Prophets and the Saints and the Martyrs and the Right- <br>eous. The best of company are they. Such is the bounty <br>of Allah, and Allah. sufficeth, as knower. (IV: 69 & 70)\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>259 4 A<br>5%<br>These incidents were of frequent occurrence with the Saha- <br>bah. Such fears in the hearts of the lovers are quite natural. <br> fi <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited these <br>verses for their consolation. <br>A person once came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, my love for you is such that <br>when I think of you, I cannot rest till I run to see you, <br>for I am sure I would die if I did not see you. Now I <br>grow very anxious when I imagine that, even if I am <br>able to enter Paradise, it will be very difficult for me to <br>see you, for you will be in a position far above my <br>reach.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) consoled him by <br>reciting the foregoing verses in his reply. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw a person <br>from the Ansar looking very much distressed. He inquired: <br>\"What makes you look so distressed?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Alldh! I have a worry.\" <br>The Prophet: \"What is it?\" <br>The person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! We come to you every morning <br>and evening. We are blessed with your sight and de- <br>lighted to be in your presence. But one day, we will be <br>deprived of your company for you will be placed on <br>heights inaccessible to us.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this, but when the foregoing verses were revealed he <br>sent for that person and gave him the glad tidings con-<br>tained therein. <br>According to another Hadith, a number of Sahabah had <br>expressed similar fears until the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) rec,ited these verses to them, and they were satis- <br>fied. <br>According to another version, the Sahabah once asked <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"The Prophets on account of their ranks will surely be <br>in much higher position than their followers. How will <br>the followers be able to see them?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Those in higher positions will come down to their <br>friends in lower positions to sit with them and talk to <br>them.\" <br>I <br>(5)The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>t <br>i<br>\"Some of my followers coming after me will love me <br>very much. They will wish that they could see me, <br>even if they had to spend their wealth, forego their <br>i <br>families and sacrifice all their possessions for it.\" <br>i <br>! <br>Khalid's daughter Abdah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) says: <br>\"My father while in bed would talk about and remem- <br>ber the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with love <br>and eagerness for him.

What a lovely thing it is to die <br>and be able to meet Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and his Sahabah.\" <br>(9) We have already read the story of Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in Chapter V While he stood at the gallows, <br>about to be executed, Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"How would you like it if Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) be killed in your place and you be let <br>off to enjoy life with your family.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"By Allah, it is unbearable for me to sit happily with <br>my family while (even) a thorn is pricking the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>On this, Abu Sufyan remarked: <br>\"There is no parallel anywhere in the world to the love <br>which the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) have for him.\" <br>A note: <br>What is expected of those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? The Ulama have <br>given various answers to this question. Qaadhi Iyaadh <br>writes: <br>\"A lover prefers his beloved above all other things and <br>persons. If this is not the case, the love is not sincere. It <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>is, therefore, essential for those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that they follow <br>him in his words and deeds, carry 'out his command- <br>ments, give up everything that he has disliked and <br>adopt his code of life (Sunnat) in ease and in adversity. <br>Allah has said in His holy book: <br>t <br>I <br>Say (0, Prophet): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah <br>I <br>will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is For- <br>giving, Merciful.\" (111: 31). <br>The Epilogue. <br>The stories given in the previous pages are meant to <br>serve as specimens. In fact a detailed account of Sahabah's <br>lives can not be covered even in big volumes. It is now <br>quite a few months since I started writing this small book. <br>My engagements in Madrasah and other matters needing <br>immediate attention have already delayed this work. I, <br>therefore, propose to finish the book at this stage, so that <br>people may at least benefit from these pages. I have to write <br>an important warning before I close. Just as we are today <br>lacking in our other duties we owe to Islam, so are we very <br>seriously neglectful in our respect and esteem of the Saha- <br>bah. Some negligent people go to the extent of even making <br>adverse remarks against them, We must remember that the <br>Sahabah are those people who laid the foundations of <br>Islam. They are the pioneers in Tabligh. We can never be <br>too grateful to them. May Allah shower His choicest bles- <br>sings on their souls for their efforts in acquiring Islam from <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and handing it <br>down to their successors. I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br><br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation. I-le has again preferred <br>four of my Sahabah over the rest of them. Thev are <br>Abu Bakr. 'Umar, 'Usinan and Ali (Kadhiyallaho <br>aniiurn).\" <br>(8) \"0, people! I am pleased with Abu Bakr. You <br>should realize his rank. I am also pleased with <br>'Umar, Ali. 'Usman, 'Talhah, Zubair, Sa'd, Sa'eed, <br>Abdur Kahman bin Auf and Abu Ubaidah (Rad- <br>hivallaho anhum). You should realize their rank. <br>0,people! Allah has anrlounced the forgiveness of <br>all those who participated in Uhud and who swore <br>allegiance at Hutfeybiah. 0, people! You should <br>have regard for me while dealing with my Saha- <br>bah. especially those who are mv kindred by mar- <br>riage. Beware doing wrong to them, lest they <br>complain against you on the Day of Judgement and <br>you mav not be pardoned.\" <br>(9) \"Have regard for me in dealing with my Sahabah <br>and my kindred ill marriage. The person who has <br>regard for me shall be in the protectio~l of Allah on <br>the Day of Judgement.

He at once came to <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! I have come to know that you <br>wish Fatimah to live near you. Here are my houses at <br>your disposal. No other house is closer to yours than <br>these. Fatimah can have her house exchanged with any <br>of these. 0,Prophet of Allah, what you accept from me <br>is dearer to me than what you leave for me.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) accepted the <br>offer, saying: <br>\"I know you are quite sincere in what you say\", and <br>gave him his blessings. <br>(4) A person came to the Prophet,[Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah!

I <br>am very anxious and distressed when I think of this <br>separation from you.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this and he did not know what to say; then Jibra'eel <br>(Alayhis Salaam) appeared and revealed the following <br>verse: <br>\"Whoso obeyeth Allah and the Prophet, they are with <br>those unto whom Allah has shown favour among the <br>Prophets and the Saints and the Martyrs and the Right- <br>eous. The best of company are they. Such is the bounty <br>of Allah, and Allah. sufficeth, as knower. (IV: 69 & 70)\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>259 4 A<br>5%<br>These incidents were of frequent occurrence with the Saha- <br>bah. Such fears in the hearts of the lovers are quite natural. <br> fi <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited these <br>verses for their consolation. <br>A person once came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, my love for you is such that <br>when I think of you, I cannot rest till I run to see you, <br>for I am sure I would die if I did not see you. Now I <br>grow very anxious when I imagine that, even if I am <br>able to enter Paradise, it will be very difficult for me to <br>see you, for you will be in a position far above my <br>reach.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) consoled him by <br>reciting the foregoing verses in his reply. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw a person <br>from the Ansar looking very much distressed. He inquired: <br>\"What makes you look so distressed?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Alldh! I have a worry.\" <br>The Prophet: \"What is it?\" <br>The person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! We come to you every morning <br>and evening. We are blessed with your sight and de- <br>lighted to be in your presence. But one day, we will be <br>deprived of your company for you will be placed on <br>heights inaccessible to us.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this, but when the foregoing verses were revealed he <br>sent for that person and gave him the glad tidings con-<br>tained therein. <br>According to another Hadith, a number of Sahabah had <br>expressed similar fears until the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) rec,ited these verses to them, and they were satis- <br>fied. <br>According to another version, the Sahabah once asked <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"The Prophets on account of their ranks will surely be <br>in much higher position than their followers. How will <br>the followers be able to see them?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Those in higher positions will come down to their <br>friends in lower positions to sit with them and talk to <br>them.\" <br>I <br>(5)The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>t <br>i<br>\"Some of my followers coming after me will love me <br>very much. They will wish that they could see me, <br>even if they had to spend their wealth, forego their <br>i <br>families and sacrifice all their possessions for it.\" <br>i <br>! <br>Khalid's daughter Abdah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) says: <br>\"My father while in bed would talk about and remem- <br>ber the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with love <br>and eagerness for him. He would also remember each <br>and every M,uhajir and Ansari (by name) and would <br>say, \"They are my elders and they are my youngers. <br>My heart is eager to meet them. 0 ,  Allah! Call me back <br>l <br>soon, so that I may be able to meet all of them. He <br>would keep on doing this till he would be overtaken <br>by sleep.\" <br>(6) Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the <br>Prophet (Sallbllaho alaihe wasallam): <br>t <br>\"I have a greater wish for your uncle Abu Talib to <br>I <br>come into Islam than for my own father, as I know it <br>i <br>would please you more.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) similarly, once said to 'Abbas <br>(The prophet's uncle): <br>\"I was more pleased at your Islam that at that of my <br>father, for that gave pleasure to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam).\" <br>(7) One night, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was on his <br>security patrol when he saw a light and heard a sound <br>coming from a house. He peeped in to find an old lady <br>spinning wool and singing a few couplets with the follow- <br>ing meaning: <br>\"May Allah accept the prayers Of the pious and the <br>elect.\" <br>\"Seeking blessings for Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br><br>Ch.

At the time of his death, his wife sat by his side ex- <br>claiming in excessive grief: <br>\"0,dear! Alas!\" <br>He retorted: \t \"Subhanallah! What a lovely thing it is to die <br>and be able to meet Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and his Sahabah.\" <br>(9) We have already read the story of Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in Chapter V While he stood at the gallows, <br>about to be executed, Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"How would you like it if Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) be killed in your place and you be let <br>off to enjoy life with your family.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"By Allah, it is unbearable for me to sit happily with <br>my family while (even) a thorn is pricking the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>On this, Abu Sufyan remarked: <br>\"There is no parallel anywhere in the world to the love <br>which the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) have for him.\" <br>A note: <br>What is expected of those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? The Ulama have <br>given various answers to this question. Qaadhi Iyaadh <br>writes: <br>\"A lover prefers his beloved above all other things and <br>persons. If this is not the case, the love is not sincere. It <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>is, therefore, essential for those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that they follow <br>him in his words and deeds, carry 'out his command- <br>ments, give up everything that he has disliked and <br>adopt his code of life (Sunnat) in ease and in adversity. <br>Allah has said in His holy book: <br>t <br>I <br>Say (0, Prophet): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah <br>I <br>will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is For- <br>giving, Merciful.\" (111: 31). <br>The Epilogue. <br>The stories given in the previous pages are meant to <br>serve as specimens. In fact a detailed account of Sahabah's <br>lives can not be covered even in big volumes. It is now <br>quite a few months since I started writing this small book. <br>My engagements in Madrasah and other matters needing <br>immediate attention have already delayed this work. I, <br>therefore, propose to finish the book at this stage, so that <br>people may at least benefit from these pages. I have to write <br>an important warning before I close. Just as we are today <br>lacking in our other duties we owe to Islam, so are we very <br>seriously neglectful in our respect and esteem of the Saha- <br>bah. Some negligent people go to the extent of even making <br>adverse remarks against them, We must remember that the <br>Sahabah are those people who laid the foundations of <br>Islam. They are the pioneers in Tabligh. We can never be <br>too grateful to them. May Allah shower His choicest bles- <br>sings on their souls for their efforts in acquiring Islam from <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and handing it <br>down to their successors. I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br><br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation. I-le has again preferred <br>four of my Sahabah over the rest of them. Thev are <br>Abu Bakr. 'Umar, 'Usinan and Ali (Kadhiyallaho <br>aniiurn).\" <br>(8) \"0, people! I am pleased with Abu Bakr. You <br>should realize his rank. I am also pleased with <br>'Umar, Ali. 'Usman, 'Talhah, Zubair, Sa'd, Sa'eed, <br>Abdur Kahman bin Auf and Abu Ubaidah (Rad- <br>hivallaho anhum). You should realize their rank. <br>0,people! Allah has anrlounced the forgiveness of <br>all those who participated in Uhud and who swore <br>allegiance at Hutfeybiah. 0, people! You should <br>have regard for me while dealing with my Saha- <br>bah. especially those who are mv kindred by mar- <br>riage. Beware doing wrong to them, lest they <br>complain against you on the Day of Judgement and <br>you mav not be pardoned.\" <br>(9) \"Have regard for me in dealing with my Sahabah <br>and my kindred ill marriage. The person who has <br>regard for me shall be in the protectio~l of Allah on <br>the Day of Judgement. Allah is free of anv obliga- <br><br>tion to him who has<br>seize him any time.\" <br>(10)\"On the Day of Judge<br>of those who have re<br>with my Sahabah.\" <br>(11) \"The person who has<br>with my Sahabah, sha<br>I shall be at Kauthar; <br>regard for me in his d<br>able to approach me<br>from a distance.\" <br>Ayub Sakhtiani (Rahmatullah <br>\"Whoso loves Abu Bakr (<br>lishes his faith.

Such fears in the hearts of the lovers are quite natural. <br> fi <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited these <br>verses for their consolation. <br>A person once came to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and said: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah, my love for you is such that <br>when I think of you, I cannot rest till I run to see you, <br>for I am sure I would die if I did not see you. Now I <br>grow very anxious when I imagine that, even if I am <br>able to enter Paradise, it will be very difficult for me to <br>see you, for you will be in a position far above my <br>reach.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) consoled him by <br>reciting the foregoing verses in his reply. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw a person <br>from the Ansar looking very much distressed. He inquired: <br>\"What makes you look so distressed?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Alldh! I have a worry.\" <br>The Prophet: \"What is it?\" <br>The person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! We come to you every morning <br>and evening. We are blessed with your sight and de- <br>lighted to be in your presence. But one day, we will be <br>deprived of your company for you will be placed on <br>heights inaccessible to us.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this, but when the foregoing verses were revealed he <br>sent for that person and gave him the glad tidings con-<br>tained therein. <br>According to another Hadith, a number of Sahabah had <br>expressed similar fears until the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) rec,ited these verses to them, and they were satis- <br>fied. <br>According to another version, the Sahabah once asked <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"The Prophets on account of their ranks will surely be <br>in much higher position than their followers. How will <br>the followers be able to see them?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Those in higher positions will come down to their <br>friends in lower positions to sit with them and talk to <br>them.\" <br>I <br>(5)The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>t <br>i<br>\"Some of my followers coming after me will love me <br>very much. They will wish that they could see me, <br>even if they had to spend their wealth, forego their <br>i <br>families and sacrifice all their possessions for it.\" <br>i <br>! <br>Khalid's daughter Abdah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) says: <br>\"My father while in bed would talk about and remem- <br>ber the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with love <br>and eagerness for him. He would also remember each <br>and every M,uhajir and Ansari (by name) and would <br>say, \"They are my elders and they are my youngers. <br>My heart is eager to meet them. 0 ,  Allah! Call me back <br>l <br>soon, so that I may be able to meet all of them. He <br>would keep on doing this till he would be overtaken <br>by sleep.\" <br>(6) Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the <br>Prophet (Sallbllaho alaihe wasallam): <br>t <br>\"I have a greater wish for your uncle Abu Talib to <br>I <br>come into Islam than for my own father, as I know it <br>i <br>would please you more.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) similarly, once said to 'Abbas <br>(The prophet's uncle): <br>\"I was more pleased at your Islam that at that of my <br>father, for that gave pleasure to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam).\" <br>(7) One night, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was on his <br>security patrol when he saw a light and heard a sound <br>coming from a house. He peeped in to find an old lady <br>spinning wool and singing a few couplets with the follow- <br>ing meaning: <br>\"May Allah accept the prayers Of the pious and the <br>elect.\" <br>\"Seeking blessings for Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br><br>Ch.

At the time of his death, his wife sat by his side ex- <br>claiming in excessive grief: <br>\"0,dear! Alas!\" <br>He retorted: \t \"Subhanallah! What a lovely thing it is to die <br>and be able to meet Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and his Sahabah.\" <br>(9) We have already read the story of Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in Chapter V While he stood at the gallows, <br>about to be executed, Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"How would you like it if Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) be killed in your place and you be let <br>off to enjoy life with your family.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"By Allah, it is unbearable for me to sit happily with <br>my family while (even) a thorn is pricking the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>On this, Abu Sufyan remarked: <br>\"There is no parallel anywhere in the world to the love <br>which the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) have for him.\" <br>A note: <br>What is expected of those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)?

It <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>is, therefore, essential for those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that they follow <br>him in his words and deeds, carry 'out his command- <br>ments, give up everything that he has disliked and <br>adopt his code of life (Sunnat) in ease and in adversity. <br>Allah has said in His holy book: <br>t <br>I <br>Say (0, Prophet): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah <br>I <br>will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is For- <br>giving, Merciful.\" (111: 31). <br>The Epilogue. <br>The stories given in the previous pages are meant to <br>serve as specimens. In fact a detailed account of Sahabah's <br>lives can not be covered even in big volumes. It is now <br>quite a few months since I started writing this small book. <br>My engagements in Madrasah and other matters needing <br>immediate attention have already delayed this work. I, <br>therefore, propose to finish the book at this stage, so that <br>people may at least benefit from these pages. I have to write <br>an important warning before I close. Just as we are today <br>lacking in our other duties we owe to Islam, so are we very <br>seriously neglectful in our respect and esteem of the Saha- <br>bah. Some negligent people go to the extent of even making <br>adverse remarks against them, We must remember that the <br>Sahabah are those people who laid the foundations of <br>Islam. They are the pioneers in Tabligh. We can never be <br>too grateful to them. May Allah shower His choicest bles- <br>sings on their souls for their efforts in acquiring Islam from <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and handing it <br>down to their successors. I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br><br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation. I-le has again preferred <br>four of my Sahabah over the rest of them. Thev are <br>Abu Bakr. 'Umar, 'Usinan and Ali (Kadhiyallaho <br>aniiurn).\" <br>(8) \"0, people! I am pleased with Abu Bakr. You <br>should realize his rank. I am also pleased with <br>'Umar, Ali. 'Usman, 'Talhah, Zubair, Sa'd, Sa'eed, <br>Abdur Kahman bin Auf and Abu Ubaidah (Rad- <br>hivallaho anhum). You should realize their rank. <br>0,people! Allah has anrlounced the forgiveness of <br>all those who participated in Uhud and who swore <br>allegiance at Hutfeybiah. 0, people! You should <br>have regard for me while dealing with my Saha- <br>bah. especially those who are mv kindred by mar- <br>riage. Beware doing wrong to them, lest they <br>complain against you on the Day of Judgement and <br>you mav not be pardoned.\" <br>(9) \"Have regard for me in dealing with my Sahabah <br>and my kindred ill marriage. The person who has <br>regard for me shall be in the protectio~l of Allah on <br>the Day of Judgement. Allah is free of anv obliga- <br><br>tion to him who has<br>seize him any time.\" <br>(10)\"On the Day of Judge<br>of those who have re<br>with my Sahabah.\" <br>(11) \"The person who has<br>with my Sahabah, sha<br>I shall be at Kauthar; <br>regard for me in his d<br>able to approach me<br>from a distance.\" <br>Ayub Sakhtiani (Rahmatullah <br>\"Whoso loves Abu Bakr (<br>lishes his faith.

I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br><br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation. I-le has again preferred <br>four of my Sahabah over the rest of them. Thev are <br>Abu Bakr. 'Umar, 'Usinan and Ali (Kadhiyallaho <br>aniiurn).\" <br>(8) \"0, people! I am pleased with Abu Bakr. You <br>should realize his rank. I am also pleased with <br>'Umar, Ali. 'Usman, 'Talhah, Zubair, Sa'd, Sa'eed, <br>Abdur Kahman bin Auf and Abu Ubaidah (Rad- <br>hivallaho anhum). You should realize their rank. <br>0,people! Allah has anrlounced the forgiveness of <br>all those who participated in Uhud and who swore <br>allegiance at Hutfeybiah. 0, people!

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\" <br><br>2) Allah was well-pleased .with the believers when <br>they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and <br>He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent dowri <br>peace and reassurance on them and rewarded them <br>with a near victory. And much booty that they cvill <br>capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. (XLVIII: 18: 19)\" <br>3) Of the believers are men who are true to what they <br>Covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their <br>vow by death (in battle), and some of them are still <br>waiting to receive their martyrdom; and they have not <br>altered in the least. (XXXIII: 23).\" <br>4) And the first to lead the way (in accepting Islam) <br>among the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who <br>followed them in'sincerity, Allah is well pleased with <br>them and they are well pleased with Him; and He hath <br>made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers <br>flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the su- <br>preme triumph. (IX: loo).\" <br>In the above verses of the Qur'an, Allah has praised Sa- <br>habah and expressed His pleasure with them. Similarly the <br>books of Hadith are full of their virtues e.g.: <br>(1) Follow Abu Bakr and 'Umar when I am no more <br>with you.\" <br>(2) \t My Sahabah are like (guiding) stars. Whomsoever <br>you follow, you will be guided (on the right <br>path):\" <br><br>(3) \t \"The likeness of my Sahabah (amongst mankind) <br>is as the likeness of salt in food. There is no relish <br>in the food without the salt.\" <br>(4) \t \"Beware (of opening your tongue) in slighting my <br>Sahabah. Do not make them the target of your cal- <br>umny. Who loves them, loves them for his love for <br>me, and who spites them spites them for his spite <br>for me. Who annoys them, annoys me, and who <br>annoys me annoys Allah. Allah will very soon <br>seize the person who annoys Him.\" <br>(5) \t \"Do not revile my Sahabah. If any of you (persons <br>coming after Sahabah) has spent gold (in Sadaqah) <br>equal in weight to. Mount Uhud, he cannot get a <br>reward equal to what my Sahabah get while <br>spending one or half mudd of grain only.\" <br>(A mudd equals 1.;'lbs.) <br>( 6 )  \"On the person who reviles my Sahabah rests the <br>curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. <br>Neither his Fardh no his Nafl is accepted by <br>Allah.\" <br>(7) \t\"After the Prophets, Allah has preferred my Saha- <br>bah above all His creation. I-le has again preferred <br>four of my Sahabah over the rest of them. Thev are <br>Abu Bakr. 'Umar, 'Usinan and Ali (Kadhiyallaho <br>aniiurn).\" <br>(8) \"0, people! I am pleased with Abu Bakr. You <br>should realize his rank. I am also pleased with <br>'Umar, Ali. 'Usman, 'Talhah, Zubair, Sa'd, Sa'eed, <br>Abdur Kahman bin Auf and Abu Ubaidah (Rad- <br>hivallaho anhum). You should realize their rank. <br>0,people! Allah has anrlounced the forgiveness of <br>all those who participated in Uhud and who swore <br>allegiance at Hutfeybiah. 0, people! You should <br>have regard for me while dealing with my Saha- <br>bah. especially those who are mv kindred by mar- <br>riage. Beware doing wrong to them, lest they <br>complain against you on the Day of Judgement and <br>you mav not be pardoned.\" <br>(9) \"Have regard for me in dealing with my Sahabah <br>and my kindred ill marriage. The person who has <br>regard for me shall be in the protectio~l of Allah on <br>the Day of Judgement.

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t <br><br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the</p></div>"

Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar.

The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits.</p></div>"

Here are my houses at <br>your disposal. No other house is closer to yours than <br>these.

He inquired: <br>\"What makes you look so distressed?\" <br>The Person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Alldh! I have a worry.\" <br>The Prophet: \"What is it?\" <br>The person: <br>\"0,Prophet of Allah! We come to you every morning <br>and evening. We are blessed with your sight and de- <br>lighted to be in your presence. But one day, we will be <br>deprived of your company for you will be placed on <br>heights inaccessible to us.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed silence <br>over this, but when the foregoing verses were revealed he <br>sent for that person and gave him the glad tidings con-<br>tained therein. <br>According to another Hadith, a number of Sahabah had <br>expressed similar fears until the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) rec,ited these verses to them, and they were satis- <br>fied. <br>According to another version, the Sahabah once asked <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): <br>\"The Prophets on account of their ranks will surely be <br>in much higher position than their followers. How will <br>the followers be able to see them?\" <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied: <br>\"Those in higher positions will come down to their <br>friends in lower positions to sit with them and talk to <br>them.\" <br>I <br>(5)The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said: <br>t <br>i<br>\"Some of my followers coming after me will love me <br>very much. They will wish that they could see me, <br>even if they had to spend their wealth, forego their <br>i <br>families and sacrifice all their possessions for it.\" <br>i <br>! <br>Khalid's daughter Abdah (Radhiyallaho anhuma) says: <br>\"My father while in bed would talk about and remem- <br>ber the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) with love <br>and eagerness for him. He would also remember each <br>and every M,uhajir and Ansari (by name) and would <br>say, \"They are my elders and they are my youngers. <br>My heart is eager to meet them. 0 ,  Allah! Call me back <br>l <br>soon, so that I may be able to meet all of them. He <br>would keep on doing this till he would be overtaken <br>by sleep.\" <br>(6) Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) once said to the <br>Prophet (Sallbllaho alaihe wasallam): <br>t <br>\"I have a greater wish for your uncle Abu Talib to <br>I <br>come into Islam than for my own father, as I know it <br>i <br>would please you more.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) similarly, once said to 'Abbas <br>(The prophet's uncle): <br>\"I was more pleased at your Islam that at that of my <br>father, for that gave pleasure to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam).\" <br>(7) One night, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) was on his <br>security patrol when he saw a light and heard a sound <br>coming from a house. He peeped in to find an old lady <br>spinning wool and singing a few couplets with the follow- <br>ing meaning: <br>\"May Allah accept the prayers Of the pious and the <br>elect.\" <br>\"Seeking blessings for Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).\" <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>261 s= <br>c. 0 <br>\"0.Allah's Prophet! You worshipped each night. And <br>0 %  <br>.f4<br>you wept before the dawning of each day.\" <br>S m  <br>\"I wish to know if I could be together with my beloved <br>\"A <br>(Prophet).\" <br>\"For death comes in different states (of mind) And I do <br>not know how I shall die.\" <br>'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on hearing these couplets, <br>sat down weeping in love and memory of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>(8)The story of Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) is known to <br>all. At the time of his death, his wife sat by his side ex- <br>claiming in excessive grief: <br>\"0,dear! Alas!\" <br>He retorted: \t \"Subhanallah! What a lovely thing it is to die <br>and be able to meet Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and his Sahabah.\" <br>(9) We have already read the story of Zaid (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) in Chapter V While he stood at the gallows, <br>about to be executed, Abu Sufyan said to him: <br>\"How would you like it if Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) be killed in your place and you be let <br>off to enjoy life with your family.\" <br>Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) replied: <br>\"By Allah, it is unbearable for me to sit happily with <br>my family while (even) a thorn is pricking the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>On this, Abu Sufyan remarked: <br>\"There is no parallel anywhere in the world to the love <br>which the companions of Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) have for him.\" <br>A note: <br>What is expected of those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? The Ulama have <br>given various answers to this question. Qaadhi Iyaadh <br>writes: <br>\"A lover prefers his beloved above all other things and <br>persons. If this is not the case, the love is not sincere. It <br>Stories of the Sahaabah <br>is, therefore, essential for those who claim to love the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that they follow <br>him in his words and deeds, carry 'out his command- <br>ments, give up everything that he has disliked and <br>adopt his code of life (Sunnat) in ease and in adversity. <br>Allah has said in His holy book: <br>t <br>I <br>Say (0, Prophet): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah <br>I <br>will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is For- <br>giving, Merciful.\" (111: 31). <br>The Epilogue. <br>The stories given in the previous pages are meant to <br>serve as specimens. In fact a detailed account of Sahabah's <br>lives can not be covered even in big volumes. It is now <br>quite a few months since I started writing this small book. <br>My engagements in Madrasah and other matters needing <br>immediate attention have already delayed this work. I, <br>therefore, propose to finish the book at this stage, so that <br>people may at least benefit from these pages. I have to write <br>an important warning before I close. Just as we are today <br>lacking in our other duties we owe to Islam, so are we very <br>seriously neglectful in our respect and esteem of the Saha- <br>bah. Some negligent people go to the extent of even making <br>adverse remarks against them, We must remember that the <br>Sahabah are those people who laid the foundations of <br>Islam. They are the pioneers in Tabligh. We can never be <br>too grateful to them. May Allah shower His choicest bles- <br>sings on their souls for their efforts in acquiring Islam from <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and handing it <br>down to their successors. I am reproducing below the <br>translation of a chapter from \"Shifa\" by Qaadhi Iyaadh: <br>\"If we claim to revere and honour the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), we must also respect his Saha- <br>bah. As Muslims, it is incumbent on us to appreciate <br>what we owe to them, to follow them and to ask for- <br>giveness of Allah for them. No doubt they had their <br><br>Ch. XII: Love for the Prophet <br>differences, but we have no right to comment on them. <br>We must beware of the stories forged by Shiahs, inno- <br>vators or biased historians, whose mischievous motive <br>is to slander some of the Sahabah and slight the others. <br>We must never doubt the sincerity and honesty of Sa- <br>habah. When we come across any event in history <br>which appears likely to lower their status in our eyes, <br>jc <br>%a <br>8 a<br>$3 <br>we must explain it as far as we can in their favour and <br>attribute it to sincere motives, for they really deserve <br>this line of action. We should always speak of their vir- <br>tues and must hold our tongue in uttering anything <br>likely to slight them. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) himself has said, \"Observe silence in re-<br>spect of my Sahabah (when they are mentioned wiih <br>disrespect).\" <br>There are many virtues and privileges of the Sahabah <br>given in the Qur'an and Hadith. Allah says in His holy <br>book: <br>\"Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. And those with <br>him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful <br>among themselves. Thou (0,Muhammad) see-est them <br>bowing and falling prostrate (in Salaat), seeking bounty <br>from Allah and (His) acceptance. On their faces there <br>are marks, being the traces of their prostration. Such is <br>their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in <br>Gospel; like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot <br>and strengthenth it and riseth firm upon it stalk, de- <br>lighting the sowers-that He may enrage the disbelievers <br>with (the sight of) them. Allah has promised, unto <br>such of them as believe and do good works, His for- <br>giveness and immense reward. (XLVIII 291.\"</p></div>"

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t <br><br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the <br>Part I (Hadith 4) <br>second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is superior to <br>a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies <br>a collection, i.e.. one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a <br>she-camel considered together, and likewise every ayat is <br>superior to the combination of an equal number of he-<br>camels or she-camels. Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. When he <br>landed at Jicldah, some of his friends in business requested <br>him to prolo~ig his stav in Jiddah, so that they could earn <br>more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his blesskd <br>presence. In fact thev wanted that some of the servants of <br>the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. At <br>first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay. <br>but when thev insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the <br>maximum profit that they woutd earn for their goods. Thev <br>explained that the profit was r7t the same in all cases; but <br>the maximum that they could expect was hundred per <br>cent. The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>1.9 <br>Iladhrat 'Aa'ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said. <br>\"One who is well versed in the Qilr'an will be in the <br>c:ompanv of those angels who are scrihes, noble and <br>righteous; and one who falters in reading the Qur'an, <br>-<br>and has to exert hard for learning, gets double the <br>reward.\" <br>\"Orie who is well versed in the Qur'an\" means one <br>\\vho is proficierit in riiemorizitlg as well as in reciting it. It <br>is highly praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and sig- <br>nifir:anc:e as well. \"To be with the angels\" means that, like <br>tht? i~ngels who transferred tlie Qur'a~i from the. Lowhul <br>Mahfooz' (Protectetl 'I'ablet in the Heavens), he also (:on- <br>\\lovs it to othors through its recitatioti and, therefore, both <br>Ilave the salnc occupation; or that he will join the company <br>of such angels on the Day of Judgement. One who faltcrs <br>ivill get double reward-olio for his reading and the other <br>tor liis effort in readi~tg the Qur'an, in spite of fitltt?~.i~~g <br>ag,lin atid again.

The reward tliot is <br>mt:ntioned for a well-versed person is far gleater. so nluc:h <br>so that he ivill be in the company of special angels. 'The ex- <br>plii~iation is that the labour involved in faltering and tlie <br>tlifficllltics in the reading of the Qur'an carry an indeperi- <br>don1 reward. As such, reading of the Qur'ali should not be <br>given up, even though faltering 1lliiv be ail excuse. <br>M ~ ~ I 1 ; ~<br>'Ali Qari has reproduc:t?ci fmm the riwbyat of Ta-<br>broni and Unihaqi that one ~ ~ 1 1 0<br>(:a11110t menlorizt* the <br>(211r'an well and yet persists i l l  loarning it by heart gets <br>doi~blt: reward.

(Plural of hafiz-one who has <br>laarnt !he whole Qur'an hv heart) on the Day of Kesurrec- <br>t ion. <br>$r <br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>the Ulama have translated, by way of metaphor, this word <br>hasad as ghibtah, meaning emulation. Ghibtah is permiss- <br>ible in worldly affairs and commendable in religious mat- <br>ters. <br>The second interpretation is that the term hasad has <br>been used in a hypothetical sense, i.e., if hasad were per- <br>missible it would have been so with regard to the two per- <br>sons mentioned above. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast <br>understanding of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Consider, for example, the citron, which gives flavour to <br>the mouth, cleans the stomach and stimulates digestion. <br>These are the qualities specially associated with the <br>reading of the Qur'an since, fragrance in the mouth. inter- <br>nal purity and spiritual strength result from reading the <br>Qur'an. It is also said that if there is citron in the house, no <br>jinn can enter it. If it is true. then such is the speciality of <br>the Qur'an. Some physicians say that citron strengthens the <br>memory and it is rep'orted in 'Ihya' by Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that three things, i.e., cleaning the teeth <br>with miswak, fasting and reading the Holy Qur'an <br>strengthen the memory. <br>i <br>In the book of Abu Dawood, it is mentioned at the con- <br>clusion of the hadith given above that a good companion is <br>like a person having musk. Even if vou do not get musk, <br>you will at least enloy its fragrance. An evil companion is <br>like a person with a furnace, near whom, even if you do not <br>get blac:kened, vou certainly cannot avoid the smoke. It is, <br>/i<br>therefore. important that one should be very careful in <br>choosing his companions, with whom he has to mix gener- <br>I <br>ally. <br>i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"He misleads many by this Book and guides many <br>thereby.\" <br>At another place we come across: <br>\"And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a <br>healing and mercy for believers, though it increases for <br>the evil-doers naught save ruin.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re- <br>ported to have said: \"Many hypocrites of this Ummat will <br>be the qurraa, i.e., those who recite the Qur'an correctly.\" <br>In 'Ihya-ul-Ulum' it is reported ffom some Mashaa'ikh. \"As <br>soon as a man starts reading a surah (chapter of the Holy <br>Qur'an), the Angels start invoking mercy for him and they <br>continue to do so till he stops reading; on the contrary an- <br>other person starts reading a surah and the Angels start <br>cursing him and they continue to do so till he completes <br>the reading.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that sometimes a man reads <br>the Holy Qur'an and invokes curses on himself without <br>even knowing it. For instance, he reads in the Holy Qur'an: <br>Virtues of the Htdy Qur'an <br>\"Beware, the curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers\" <br>and he exposes himself to this warning because of his wrong- <br>doings. <br>In the like manner, he reads in the Qur'an: <br>\"The curse of Allah is upon the liars\". <br>In fact he exposes himself to the warning by reason of <br>his being himself a liar. <br>'Aamir ibn Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) say$ that <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhivallaho anho) had appointed Naafi' <br>ibn Abdul Harith as the Governor of Mecca. Once he asked <br>the latter as to whom he had appointed as the administra- <br>tor of forests. \"Ibn Abzi\" replied Naafi'. \"Who is Ibn-e- <br>Abzi?\" said Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). \"He is <br>one of our slaves\" was the reply. \"Why have you appointed <br>a slave the ameer (leader)?\" objected Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho an\\ho). \"Because he recites the Book of Allah\" <br>said Naafi'. At this, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrated the hadith that it had been said by Rasullullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that, because of this Book. <br>Allah elevates many people and degrades many. <br>Hadhrat 'Abdur Rahman ibn 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \",On the Day of Judgement, three things will be <br>under the shade of the Arsh (Allah's Throne). One, the <br>Holy Qur'an which will argue with men-the Qur'an <br>has both an exterior and an interior. The second will <br>b <br>i <br>1t <br>! \t<br>E <br>I i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  \t<br>be amaanat (trust). The third will be kinship, which <br>shall proclaim, '0. Allah! have mercy wn the person <br>who upheld me. and deprive him of Your merry who- <br>soever severed me.' \" <br>\"Three things will be under the shade of the 'Arsh\" <br>signifies their utmost nearness in the sublime preserlce of <br>Allah. \"The Qur'an will argue\" nieans that it will pleacl tht: <br>cause of those people who read it, respect it and act upon <br>its commandments. It will intercede on their behalf and <br>solicit the upgrading of their rank. Mulla 'Ali Qari has tiar- <br>rated on the authority of 'Tirmizi' (a book of Hadith) that. <br>in the presence of Almighty Allah, the Holy Qur'iin will <br>beg Allah to grant an apparel to its reader. Almightv Allah <br>will give him a crown of honour. The Qur'an will again beg <br>for additional favoitrs for him. Thereupon Alrnighlv All;th <br>will award the reader a complete robe of honour. 'I'llu <br>Qur'an will again beseech Allah to be pleased with him. <br>and Almighty Allah will express His pleasure to him. <br>We find in this life that the pleasure of the belovt:d is <br>considered to be the most coveted gift. Similarly ill the life <br>Hereafter, no bountv shall stand comparison with the <br>pleasure of our ljeloved Alnlighty Allah. And in c a w  of <br>those who ignore their duty towards the Qur'an. it will <br>challenge them saving, \"Did you care for me'? Ilid vou fullil <br>your obligations towards me?\" <br>It has been reported on the authority of Irnnrn Abu <br>Hariifa (Rahn~atullah alaih) in 'Ihya' that it is the clue right <br>of the Qur'an that it should be read completely tu' <br>,I<br>year. Those of us who never care to reaci the Qur'an shoultl <br>first consider how they will defend themselves agilir~st <br>such a strong plaintiff. Death is inevitable and thew (:an l)e <br>no escape from it. <br>The meaning of the expression \"exterior and interior of <br>the Qur'an\" is evident. The Qur'an has an apparcxlt mean- <br>ing which can be understood by all. but the doepcr spiri- <br>tual significance is not understood by everybody. It is in <br>this connection that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said: \"Whosoever expresses his personal opinion <br>in respect of anything .in the dur'an commits <br>niistake. <br>even if he be right in his opinion.\" <br>Some scholars hold that the word 'exterior'. refers to <br>its words, which can be recited properlv by evervbodv and <br>the word 'interior', i.e., spirit, refers to its n~eanings. and its <br>underlying ideas, the understanding of which varies with <br>the ability of the readers. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If vou <br>seek knowledge, you should meditate on the meanings of <br>I <br>the Qur'an, because it embodies the history of former as <br>well as of latter times.\" It is, however, essential to observe <br>the pre-requisites for interpreting the Qur'an. An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word <br>has several meanings. A person may be knowing <br>only one or two of them, though in a given context <br>the gctual meaning may be quite different.\" <br>(2) \t Nahw, i.e., syntax, a branch of grammar. w11ic:h <br>helps in understanding the relation of a sentence <br>with another and also of I'raab (vowel sounds) of <br>the letters of a word. A change in I'raab often <br>means a change in the meaning. <br>(3) Sarf. i.e., et$mology, a branch of grammar, which <br>helps in knowing the root words and conjugations. <br>The moaning of a word changes with the change in <br>the root and with a change in its conjugation. <br>Ibri Faris (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One who loses the <br>knowledge of etymology loses a great deal.\" 'Allamah <br>Zamakhshari (Rahmatullah alaih) mentions that, when a <br>certain person set to translate the ayat- <br>On the day that We shall call each and every people <br>after their leader, <br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta- <br>phors become known. <br>(7) \t llrnul Badee', i.e., knowledge of rhetoric, the <br>knowledge which reveals the beauty of language <br>and its implications. <br>The last three are the branches of Ilmul Balaaghah <br>(knowledge of oratory), clnd are considered very important <br>subjects, which a cornmelltator should master, because the <br>Glorious Qur'an is a perfect miracle and its amazing con- <br>structions can only be understood after mastering these <br>subjects. <br>(8) \t llmul Qirrta'ah, i.e., knowledge of the art of pro- <br>nunciation. because different methods of recita-<br>ti011 sc~metimes convey different meanings, anci <br>so~nekimesone meaning is to be preferred over the <br>other. <br>(9) \t IlmuJ Aqaa'id, i.e.,knowledge of the fundamentals <br>of faith. This is necessarv to explain certain ana- <br>logies. The literal meaning of certain ayaat refer- <br>ring to Almighty Allah is not the correct one. For <br>example, the analogy in the ayat-- <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>(The hand of Allah is over their hands) <br>will have to be explained because Allah has no physical <br>hands. <br>(10)Usoolul Fiqh i.e., Prin~iples of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence. These are necessary for reasoning out and <br>finding arguments in the basic support of state-<br>ments. <br>(11)Asbaabun Nuzool, i.e., the particular circum-<br>stances which caused revelation. The meaning of <br>an ayat will be better understood if we know how <br>arid when it had been revealed. Someti~nes the <br>true meaning of an ayat is understood only if we <br>know the circumstances in which the ayat had <br>been revealed. <br>(12)An Naasikh wal Mansookh, i.e., knowledge of <br>commandments that have subsequently been abro- <br>gated or changed. so that abrogated command-<br>ments may be distinguished from the standing <br>ones. <br>(13)IImul Fiqh, i.e., knowledge of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence, because it is only through this knowledge <br>that' we arrive at a complete understanding of gen- <br>eral principles. <br>(14)Knowledge of such ahadith that happen to be com- <br>mentary on cerfain brief verses of the Qur'an. <br>(15)The last but most important is the Wahbi ilm, or <br>the gifted understanding, bestowed by Almighty <br>Allah upon Ilis selected ones, as is referred in the <br>hadith-<br>Whosoever acts upon what he knows, Almighty Allah <br>bestows upon him the knowledge of things not known <br>to him. <br>. <br>It is this special understanding that was implied in the <br>reply of Hadhrat 'Ali (Karramallaahu wajhahu) (may Allah <br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe-wasallam). <br>Allamah Suyuti says that those who think that it is <br>beyond the capacity of a man to acquire Wahbi ilm, or <br>gifted understanding, are not right. To get this k~iowledge <br>from Allah, one should adopt the means to this end, e.g., <br>acting upon the kllowledge that one has acquired, and dis- <br>inclination towards the world. <br>It is stated in 'Keemiyaa-e-Sa'aadat' that three persons <br>are not blessed with complete understanding of the Qur'an. <br>First, one who is not well versed in Arabic, seco~ldly, one <br>who persists in committing a major sin or indulges in act of <br>religious innovation, because these actions blacken his <br>heart, which in turn prevents him from understanding the <br>Qur'an. Thirdly, one who is a rationalist, even in the niatter <br>of faith, and feels enibarassed when he reads an ayat of the <br>Qur'a~i which he is not able to fully rationalize. <br>May Allah protect us from all such sins and evils. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>there is a tradition in Musnad Ahmad- <br>Till he reads of whatever Qur'an is with him. <br>This word more clearly refers to a hafiz, although a <br>reader who remains very often engaged in reciting the <br>Qur'an inay also be implied. <br>It is written in ' ~ i 6 a a t '  <br>that this hadith does not apply <br>to a reader who is accursed by the Qur'an. This is with re- <br>ference to the hadith that there are many readers of the <br>Qur'an who read the Qur'an but the Qur'an invokes curses <br>upon them. Therefore, the reading of Qur'an by a person <br>who does not adhere to the correct tenets does not consti- <br>tutc ar! argument that he is acceptable to Allah. Many Aha- <br>dith of this type relate to the Khawarij (a sect who were <br>opposed to Hadhrat 'Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>In this conimentary, Shah Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) has written that 'tarteel' literally means reading with <br>good and clear pronunciation, while according to Islamic <br>pri~ciplesit means reading in accordance with certain <br>rdes as follows: <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the <br>liver likes sweet things. Therefore, if a perfume is used at <br>the time of recitation, it will have a better influence on the <br>heart. <br>(6) Tashdeed ( (5) ) (doubling of letters) and madd ( (3) ) <br>(prolongation of letters) should be fully pro-<br>nounced because this reveals the grandeur of the <br>Qur'an and adds to its effectiveness. <br>(7) \t As stated earlier, the reader's heart should respond <br>to the ayat indicating mercy of Allah or chastise- <br>ment by Him. <br>The aboce-me~~tioned <br>seven rules constitute the cor- <br>rect way of reciting the Qur'an, which is called tarteel, and <br>the sole object of all this is to reach the correct understand- <br>ing and grasp of the deeper meaning of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Hadhrat Umm-e-Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>once askecl by someone as to how Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>aleihe wasallam) used to recite Qur'an. She said, \"In a way <br>that all vowel sounds were clear and the pronunciation of <br>each letter was distinct.\" It is desirable to recite the Qur'an <br>with propriety even if one may not understand the mean- <br>ing. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that he preferred <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari- <br>ously reported'to be 204,14,19,25,36. <br>It is written in 'Sharhul-Ihya' that each ayat corre-<br>sponds to a higher level in Paradise. So a reader will be <br>asked to ascend according to his recitation. One who reads <br>the whole of the Qur'an will attain the highest level in Par- <br>adise. And one who knows only a part of the Qur'an will <br>rise up to the proportionate level. In brief, the stage or level <br>reached will be fixed by the number of ayaat recited. <br>According to my understanding, the above hadith has <br>a different meaning- <br>(If my interpretation is corect, it is from Allah and, if it <br>is wrong, it is from me and from Satan, and Allah and <br>His Prophet are free from it.) <br>I think that the elevation implied in this hadith is not <br>that which can be determined by the number of ayat to be <br>recited. i.e., when one ayat be recited, the status will be <br>raised by one step, whether it be read with propriety or <br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says: <br>0' Shaheedi! His bounties are common for all, You <br>could not be denied [these bounties), if you were all <br>worthy. <br>HADITH 10 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever reads one letter of the Rook of Allah is credited <br>with one blessing and one blessing is equal to~~enfold <br>the like thereof in its reward. 1 do not say that @Jl(Alif <br>Laam Meem) is one letter, but ' (9' (alif) is one letter, ' (J, <br>'(laam) is one letter, and '(r)' (meem) is one letter.\" <br>The hadith affirms that whereas, ordinarily for the pur- <br>pose of reward an act as a whole is taken into account but <br>in the case of Qur'an it is not so, parts also count. Thus, in <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings. There is a differeilce of opinion anlong scholars <br>whether 'dl'(alif, laam, meem) is the beginning of Surah <br>Baqarah or of Surah Feel. If it is the beginning of Surah Ba- <br>qarah, and only three letters are counted, as they are writ- <br>ten, then the blessings wi!l be thirty. And if it is the <br>beginning of Surah Feel, then ' ( I ) '  (alif),'(3)'(laam) and '(f)' <br>(meem). which is the beginning of Surah Eaqarah will be <br>nine letters. Therefore, its reward will be ninety blessings. <br>Baihaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported another <br>hadith similar to this portion of the above-mentioned <br>hadith, viz.. \"I do nolt say that '(Ale)' <br>(Bismillah) is one <br>letter, but uphold that '(d)' (ha) '(,.I)' <br>(sin) and '(9'(meem), <br>etc, are separate letters.\" <br>HADITH- 11 <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz Juhani (Radhiyallaho anho) reports <br>that Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. <br>Part I (Hadith 11) <br>\"Whoever reads the Qur'an and acts upon what is con- <br>tained in it, his parents will be made to wear a crown <br>on the Day of Judgement, the brilliance of which will <br>excel that of the sun, if the same were within your <br>wordly houses. So, what do you think about the person <br>4 I ,<br>Zi,<br>who himself acts upon it?\" <br>Thus, it is through the virtues of his reading the Qur'an <br>.-<br>W<br>W<br> <br>+<br>and acting upon it that the parents of the leader will be <br>a-x <br>honoured with a crown, the brilliance of which will far <br>excel the light of the sun even if the sun were within one's <br>own house. The sun is at a great distance from us and even <br>then its light is so bright. If the sun comes down into one's <br>house, its light and brilliance will surely increase mani- <br>fold. The light of the crown to be worn by the parents of <br>the reader will be still more brilliant. When this is in $tore <br>for the parents, what will be the reward of the reader him- <br>self? Surely if the beneficiaries get so much, the reward of <br>the person who is the real cause should be much more. The <br>parents get this reward solely because they were the cause <br>of the reader coming into being, or were responsible for his <br>education. <br>In addition to the fact that the light of the sun will he <br>far greater if it were in one's own house, this simile implies <br>yet another delicate point. Attachment and liking for a <br>thing increase when it always remains with a person. <br>Therefore, the feeling of strangeness for the sun due to dis- <br>tance will give place to attachment, because of its close <br>nearness all the time. Thus, in addition to describing the <br>brilliance of the crown, the hadith implies this attachment <br>with the crown and also the great satisfaction that it be- <br>longs to oneself. Everybody gets benefited by the sun, but if <br>it were to be given entirely to a person, how very proud he <br>would feel. <br>Haakim (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported from Burai- <br>dah, (Radhiyallaho anho) saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam); \"One who recites the Qur'an and acts <br>upon it will be made to wear a crown woven with noor, <br>and his parents will be made to wear garments, which will <br>be more valuable than the entire world. They will say, <br>'Almighty Allah! what is it that we are being given these <br>garments for?' 'In lieu of the reading of Qur'an by your <br>child', will be the reply.\" <br>It is given in Jam'ul Fawaa'id by Tabrani (Rahmatullah <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>alaih) that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had reported <br>the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Whoever teaches the reading of Qur'an to his son (without <br>memorizing it), all his sins, whether previous or subse-<br>quent, will be forgiven; and whoever makes his child mem- <br>orize the Qur'an will be raised on the Day of Judgement in <br>the semblance of a full moon; and his son will be asked to <br>start reciting, and for every ayat read by the child, the <br>status of the parent will be raised to the next higher grade <br>of jannat, till the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is com- <br>pleted.\" <br>Such are the blessings for teaching the Qur'an to your <br>children. This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on <br>iour shoulders a very heavy accountability. The hadith <br>that-<br>Each one of you is a guardian, and will be questioned <br>about those under his control <br>means that everyone s,hall be questioned about his subordi- <br>nates and dependents as to what extent he taught (deen) to <br>them. Surely one should guard himself and his dependents <br>against these shortcomings. But (as the proverb goes) <br>\"should one discard clothes for fear of lice?\" Nav, one <br>should surely try to keep his clothes clean. If you impart <br>religious education to your child, you will be free from <br>vour responsibilities. As long as the child lives, and what- <br>ever good deed he does and salad he performs and forgive- <br>ness that he seeks from Allah for you, will elevate your <br>position in Paradise. If for the sake of this life and for the <br>lust of a few coppers, you keep him ignorant of (deen), not <br>only wiil you have to suffer for this misdeed but whatever <br>evil and misdeeds he does. your account will not be free <br>from their burden. For God's sake, have pity on yourselves. <br>This life is only a passing phase and death will put an end <br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica- <br>tion of the hadith is general arid not confined to any par- <br>ticular period. It means that if any hafiz of Qur'an were cast <br>in due to any crime on his part, the fire of Hell will not <br>affect him. In another hadith it is said that the fire will not <br>even touch him. The second interpretation of the above- <br>mentioned hadith is also supported by another hadith re- <br>ported by Abu Umaamah (Radhiyallaho anho) and also <br>given in the book Sharhus Sunnah, by Mulla Ali Qari, <br>which says, \"Learn the Qur'an by heart, because Almighty <br>Allah does not punish the heart which contains the <br>Qur'an .\" In its meanings this hadith is clear and confirmed <br>by the Qur'an. Those who regard memorizing the Qur'an as <br>useless should, for God's sake, ponder over these merits. <br>The last-mentioned one alone should prompt everybody to <br>dedicate his life to learning the Qur'an by heart, because <br>there is no one who has not committed sins and does not <br>deserve the fire of Hell. <br>In Sharhul Ihya there is a list of those people who wiil <br>rest in the shade of Allah's mercy (protection) on the hor- <br>rible Day of Judgement. It is mentioned therein that. <br>according to a hadith reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) by Dailami that the custodians of Qur'an, in <br>other words those who learn the Qur'an by heart, will be in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell.\" <br>By the grace of Allah, entry into Jannat is ensured for <br>every believer though it may come after his being punished <br>for his misdeeds. The hafiz will, however, be favoured with <br>this entry right from the beginning. The ten persons in <br>whose favour his intercession will be accepted will be <br>those sinful and disobedient Muslims who are guilty of <br>major sins. There can be no intercession, however, for the <br>unbelievers. Almighty Allah has said: <br>Whosoever ascribes partners unto Allah, for him Allah <br>has forbidden Jannat, and their place is Hell - and for <br>evil-doers there will be none amongst the helpers. <br>It is also said in the Qur'an: <br>The Prophet and the believers are not allowed to pray <br>for the forgiveness of 'mushrikin' (Plural of mushrik, <br>one who ascribes partners unto Allah) the polytheists <br>even if they are their relatives.</p></div>"

(This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Learn the Qur'an and recite it, because the example of <br>one who learns the Qur'an, reads it and recites it in Ta- <br>hajjud (salaat late after midnight) is like an open bag <br>full of musk, the fragrance whereof spreads over the <br>entire place, and a person who has learnt the Qur'an <br>but sleeps while the Qur'an is in his heart, is like a bag <br>full of musk but with its mouth closed.\" <br>It means that the example of one who learns the Quran and <br>cares for it and recites it in Tahajjud salaat is like that of a <br>musk-container which, if opened, fills the whole house <br>with its sweet smell. In the same way, the entire house is <br>lit up with divine light and blessings due to the recitation <br>by the hafiz. Even if the hafiz remains asleep or does not <br>recite through his negligence, the Qur'an in his heart is in <br>any case the musk. This negligence resulted in the loss that <br>others were deprived of the blessings of Qur'an, but his <br>heart does, in any case, contain the musk of Qur'an.</p></div>"

His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration.

Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t <br><br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the <br>Part I (Hadith 4) <br>second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is superior to <br>a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies <br>a collection, i.e.. one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a <br>she-camel considered together, and likewise every ayat is <br>superior to the combination of an equal number of he-<br>camels or she-camels. Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. When he <br>landed at Jicldah, some of his friends in business requested <br>him to prolo~ig his stav in Jiddah, so that they could earn <br>more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his blesskd <br>presence. In fact thev wanted that some of the servants of <br>the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. At <br>first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay. <br>but when thev insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the <br>maximum profit that they woutd earn for their goods. Thev <br>explained that the profit was r7t the same in all cases; but <br>the maximum that they could expect was hundred per <br>cent. The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>1.9 <br>Iladhrat 'Aa'ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said. <br>\"One who is well versed in the Qilr'an will be in the <br>c:ompanv of those angels who are scrihes, noble and <br>righteous; and one who falters in reading the Qur'an, <br>-<br>and has to exert hard for learning, gets double the <br>reward.\" <br>\"Orie who is well versed in the Qur'an\" means one <br>\\vho is proficierit in riiemorizitlg as well as in reciting it. It <br>is highly praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and sig- <br>nifir:anc:e as well. \"To be with the angels\" means that, like <br>tht? i~ngels who transferred tlie Qur'a~i from the. Lowhul <br>Mahfooz' (Protectetl 'I'ablet in the Heavens), he also (:on- <br>\\lovs it to othors through its recitatioti and, therefore, both <br>Ilave the salnc occupation; or that he will join the company <br>of such angels on the Day of Judgement. One who faltcrs <br>ivill get double reward-olio for his reading and the other <br>tor liis effort in readi~tg the Qur'an, in spite of fitltt?~.i~~g <br>ag,lin atid again. It does liot rnean that liis reward will <br>c:xc.eed that of a well-versed person.

(Plural of hafiz-one who has <br>laarnt !he whole Qur'an hv heart) on the Day of Kesurrec- <br>t ion. <br>$r <br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>the Ulama have translated, by way of metaphor, this word <br>hasad as ghibtah, meaning emulation. Ghibtah is permiss- <br>ible in worldly affairs and commendable in religious mat- <br>ters. <br>The second interpretation is that the term hasad has <br>been used in a hypothetical sense, i.e., if hasad were per- <br>missible it would have been so with regard to the two per- <br>sons mentioned above. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast <br>understanding of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Consider, for example, the citron, which gives flavour to <br>the mouth, cleans the stomach and stimulates digestion. <br>These are the qualities specially associated with the <br>reading of the Qur'an since, fragrance in the mouth. inter- <br>nal purity and spiritual strength result from reading the <br>Qur'an. It is also said that if there is citron in the house, no <br>jinn can enter it. If it is true. then such is the speciality of <br>the Qur'an. Some physicians say that citron strengthens the <br>memory and it is rep'orted in 'Ihya' by Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that three things, i.e., cleaning the teeth <br>with miswak, fasting and reading the Holy Qur'an <br>strengthen the memory. <br>i <br>In the book of Abu Dawood, it is mentioned at the con- <br>clusion of the hadith given above that a good companion is <br>like a person having musk. Even if vou do not get musk, <br>you will at least enloy its fragrance. An evil companion is <br>like a person with a furnace, near whom, even if you do not <br>get blac:kened, vou certainly cannot avoid the smoke. It is, <br>/i<br>therefore. important that one should be very careful in <br>choosing his companions, with whom he has to mix gener- <br>I <br>ally. <br>i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"He misleads many by this Book and guides many <br>thereby.\" <br>At another place we come across: <br>\"And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a <br>healing and mercy for believers, though it increases for <br>the evil-doers naught save ruin.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re- <br>ported to have said: \"Many hypocrites of this Ummat will <br>be the qurraa, i.e., those who recite the Qur'an correctly.\" <br>In 'Ihya-ul-Ulum' it is reported ffom some Mashaa'ikh. \"As <br>soon as a man starts reading a surah (chapter of the Holy <br>Qur'an), the Angels start invoking mercy for him and they <br>continue to do so till he stops reading; on the contrary an- <br>other person starts reading a surah and the Angels start <br>cursing him and they continue to do so till he completes <br>the reading.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that sometimes a man reads <br>the Holy Qur'an and invokes curses on himself without <br>even knowing it. For instance, he reads in the Holy Qur'an: <br>Virtues of the Htdy Qur'an <br>\"Beware, the curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers\" <br>and he exposes himself to this warning because of his wrong- <br>doings. <br>In the like manner, he reads in the Qur'an: <br>\"The curse of Allah is upon the liars\". <br>In fact he exposes himself to the warning by reason of <br>his being himself a liar. <br>'Aamir ibn Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) say$ that <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhivallaho anho) had appointed Naafi' <br>ibn Abdul Harith as the Governor of Mecca. Once he asked <br>the latter as to whom he had appointed as the administra- <br>tor of forests. \"Ibn Abzi\" replied Naafi'. \"Who is Ibn-e- <br>Abzi?\" said Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). \"He is <br>one of our slaves\" was the reply. \"Why have you appointed <br>a slave the ameer (leader)?\" objected Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho an\\ho). \"Because he recites the Book of Allah\" <br>said Naafi'. At this, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrated the hadith that it had been said by Rasullullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that, because of this Book. <br>Allah elevates many people and degrades many. <br>Hadhrat 'Abdur Rahman ibn 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \",On the Day of Judgement, three things will be <br>under the shade of the Arsh (Allah's Throne). One, the <br>Holy Qur'an which will argue with men-the Qur'an <br>has both an exterior and an interior. The second will <br>b <br>i <br>1t <br>! \t<br>E <br>I i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  \t<br>be amaanat (trust). The third will be kinship, which <br>shall proclaim, '0. Allah! have mercy wn the person <br>who upheld me. and deprive him of Your merry who- <br>soever severed me.' \" <br>\"Three things will be under the shade of the 'Arsh\" <br>signifies their utmost nearness in the sublime preserlce of <br>Allah. \"The Qur'an will argue\" nieans that it will pleacl tht: <br>cause of those people who read it, respect it and act upon <br>its commandments. It will intercede on their behalf and <br>solicit the upgrading of their rank. Mulla 'Ali Qari has tiar- <br>rated on the authority of 'Tirmizi' (a book of Hadith) that. <br>in the presence of Almighty Allah, the Holy Qur'iin will <br>beg Allah to grant an apparel to its reader. Almightv Allah <br>will give him a crown of honour. The Qur'an will again beg <br>for additional favoitrs for him. Thereupon Alrnighlv All;th <br>will award the reader a complete robe of honour. 'I'llu <br>Qur'an will again beseech Allah to be pleased with him. <br>and Almighty Allah will express His pleasure to him. <br>We find in this life that the pleasure of the belovt:d is <br>considered to be the most coveted gift. Similarly ill the life <br>Hereafter, no bountv shall stand comparison with the <br>pleasure of our ljeloved Alnlighty Allah. And in c a w  of <br>those who ignore their duty towards the Qur'an. it will <br>challenge them saving, \"Did you care for me'? Ilid vou fullil <br>your obligations towards me?\" <br>It has been reported on the authority of Irnnrn Abu <br>Hariifa (Rahn~atullah alaih) in 'Ihya' that it is the clue right <br>of the Qur'an that it should be read completely tu' <br>,I<br>year. Those of us who never care to reaci the Qur'an shoultl <br>first consider how they will defend themselves agilir~st <br>such a strong plaintiff. Death is inevitable and thew (:an l)e <br>no escape from it. <br>The meaning of the expression \"exterior and interior of <br>the Qur'an\" is evident. The Qur'an has an apparcxlt mean- <br>ing which can be understood by all. but the doepcr spiri- <br>tual significance is not understood by everybody. It is in <br>this connection that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said: \"Whosoever expresses his personal opinion <br>in respect of anything .in the dur'an commits <br>niistake. <br>even if he be right in his opinion.\" <br>Some scholars hold that the word 'exterior'. refers to <br>its words, which can be recited properlv by evervbodv and <br>the word 'interior', i.e., spirit, refers to its n~eanings. and its <br>underlying ideas, the understanding of which varies with <br>the ability of the readers. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If vou <br>seek knowledge, you should meditate on the meanings of <br>I <br>the Qur'an, because it embodies the history of former as <br>well as of latter times.\" It is, however, essential to observe <br>the pre-requisites for interpreting the Qur'an. An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word <br>has several meanings. A person may be knowing <br>only one or two of them, though in a given context <br>the gctual meaning may be quite different.\" <br>(2) \t Nahw, i.e., syntax, a branch of grammar. w11ic:h <br>helps in understanding the relation of a sentence <br>with another and also of I'raab (vowel sounds) of <br>the letters of a word. A change in I'raab often <br>means a change in the meaning. <br>(3) Sarf. i.e., et$mology, a branch of grammar, which <br>helps in knowing the root words and conjugations. <br>The moaning of a word changes with the change in <br>the root and with a change in its conjugation. <br>Ibri Faris (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One who loses the <br>knowledge of etymology loses a great deal.\" 'Allamah <br>Zamakhshari (Rahmatullah alaih) mentions that, when a <br>certain person set to translate the ayat- <br>On the day that We shall call each and every people <br>after their leader,</p></div>"

'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little.</p></div>"

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is.</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>15 <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t <br><br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the <br>Part I (Hadith 4) <br>second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is superior to <br>a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies <br>a collection, i.e.. one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a <br>she-camel considered together, and likewise every ayat is <br>superior to the combination of an equal number of he-<br>camels or she-camels. Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. When he <br>landed at Jicldah, some of his friends in business requested <br>him to prolo~ig his stav in Jiddah, so that they could earn <br>more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his blesskd <br>presence. In fact thev wanted that some of the servants of <br>the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. At <br>first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay. <br>but when thev insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the <br>maximum profit that they woutd earn for their goods. Thev <br>explained that the profit was r7t the same in all cases; but <br>the maximum that they could expect was hundred per <br>cent. The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>1.9 <br>Iladhrat 'Aa'ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said. <br>\"One who is well versed in the Qilr'an will be in the <br>c:ompanv of those angels who are scrihes, noble and <br>righteous; and one who falters in reading the Qur'an, <br>-<br>and has to exert hard for learning, gets double the <br>reward.\" <br>\"Orie who is well versed in the Qur'an\" means one <br>\\vho is proficierit in riiemorizitlg as well as in reciting it. It <br>is highly praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and sig- <br>nifir:anc:e as well. \"To be with the angels\" means that, like <br>tht? i~ngels who transferred tlie Qur'a~i from the. Lowhul <br>Mahfooz' (Protectetl 'I'ablet in the Heavens), he also (:on- <br>\\lovs it to othors through its recitatioti and, therefore, both <br>Ilave the salnc occupation; or that he will join the company <br>of such angels on the Day of Judgement. One who faltcrs <br>ivill get double reward-olio for his reading and the other <br>tor liis effort in readi~tg the Qur'an, in spite of fitltt?~.i~~g <br>ag,lin atid again. It does liot rnean that liis reward will <br>c:xc.eed that of a well-versed person. The reward tliot is <br>mt:ntioned for a well-versed person is far gleater. so nluc:h <br>so that he ivill be in the company of special angels. 'The ex- <br>plii~iation is that the labour involved in faltering and tlie <br>tlifficllltics in the reading of the Qur'an carry an indeperi- <br>don1 reward. As such, reading of the Qur'ali should not be <br>given up, even though faltering 1lliiv be ail excuse. <br>M ~ ~ I 1 ; ~<br>'Ali Qari has reproduc:t?ci fmm the riwbyat of Ta-<br>broni and Unihaqi that one ~ ~ 1 1 0<br>(:a11110t menlorizt* the <br>(211r'an well and yet persists i l l  loarning it by heart gets <br>doi~blt: reward. Sitnilarly, one who cherishes a longing for <br>111cmorizi.ingit and does not posst!ss the iibilitv to do so, but <br>doc.s not give up his efforts. will t)e reckoned by Almighty <br>hllah atnorig the hl~ffaili! (Plural of hafiz-one who has <br>laarnt !he whole Qur'an hv heart) on the Day of Kesurrec- <br>t ion. <br>$r <br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>the Ulama have translated, by way of metaphor, this word <br>hasad as ghibtah, meaning emulation. Ghibtah is permiss- <br>ible in worldly affairs and commendable in religious mat- <br>ters. <br>The second interpretation is that the term hasad has <br>been used in a hypothetical sense, i.e., if hasad were per- <br>missible it would have been so with regard to the two per- <br>sons mentioned above. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast <br>understanding of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Consider, for example, the citron, which gives flavour to <br>the mouth, cleans the stomach and stimulates digestion. <br>These are the qualities specially associated with the <br>reading of the Qur'an since, fragrance in the mouth. inter- <br>nal purity and spiritual strength result from reading the <br>Qur'an. It is also said that if there is citron in the house, no <br>jinn can enter it. If it is true. then such is the speciality of <br>the Qur'an. Some physicians say that citron strengthens the <br>memory and it is rep'orted in 'Ihya' by Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that three things, i.e., cleaning the teeth <br>with miswak, fasting and reading the Holy Qur'an <br>strengthen the memory. <br>i <br>In the book of Abu Dawood, it is mentioned at the con- <br>clusion of the hadith given above that a good companion is <br>like a person having musk. Even if vou do not get musk, <br>you will at least enloy its fragrance. An evil companion is <br>like a person with a furnace, near whom, even if you do not <br>get blac:kened, vou certainly cannot avoid the smoke. It is, <br>/i<br>therefore. important that one should be very careful in <br>choosing his companions, with whom he has to mix gener- <br>I <br>ally. <br>i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"He misleads many by this Book and guides many <br>thereby.\" <br>At another place we come across: <br>\"And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a <br>healing and mercy for believers, though it increases for <br>the evil-doers naught save ruin.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re- <br>ported to have said: \"Many hypocrites of this Ummat will <br>be the qurraa, i.e., those who recite the Qur'an correctly.\" <br>In 'Ihya-ul-Ulum' it is reported ffom some Mashaa'ikh. \"As <br>soon as a man starts reading a surah (chapter of the Holy <br>Qur'an), the Angels start invoking mercy for him and they <br>continue to do so till he stops reading; on the contrary an- <br>other person starts reading a surah and the Angels start <br>cursing him and they continue to do so till he completes <br>the reading.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that sometimes a man reads <br>the Holy Qur'an and invokes curses on himself without <br>even knowing it. For instance, he reads in the Holy Qur'an: <br>Virtues of the Htdy Qur'an <br>\"Beware, the curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers\" <br>and he exposes himself to this warning because of his wrong- <br>doings. <br>In the like manner, he reads in the Qur'an: <br>\"The curse of Allah is upon the liars\". <br>In fact he exposes himself to the warning by reason of <br>his being himself a liar. <br>'Aamir ibn Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) say$ that <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhivallaho anho) had appointed Naafi' <br>ibn Abdul Harith as the Governor of Mecca. Once he asked <br>the latter as to whom he had appointed as the administra- <br>tor of forests. \"Ibn Abzi\" replied Naafi'. \"Who is Ibn-e- <br>Abzi?\" said Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). \"He is <br>one of our slaves\" was the reply. \"Why have you appointed <br>a slave the ameer (leader)?\" objected Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho an\\ho). \"Because he recites the Book of Allah\" <br>said Naafi'. At this, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrated the hadith that it had been said by Rasullullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that, because of this Book. <br>Allah elevates many people and degrades many. <br>Hadhrat 'Abdur Rahman ibn 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \",On the Day of Judgement, three things will be <br>under the shade of the Arsh (Allah's Throne). One, the <br>Holy Qur'an which will argue with men-the Qur'an <br>has both an exterior and an interior. The second will <br>b <br>i <br>1t <br>! \t<br>E <br>I i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  \t<br>be amaanat (trust). The third will be kinship, which <br>shall proclaim, '0. Allah! have mercy wn the person <br>who upheld me. and deprive him of Your merry who- <br>soever severed me.' \" <br>\"Three things will be under the shade of the 'Arsh\" <br>signifies their utmost nearness in the sublime preserlce of <br>Allah. \"The Qur'an will argue\" nieans that it will pleacl tht: <br>cause of those people who read it, respect it and act upon <br>its commandments. It will intercede on their behalf and <br>solicit the upgrading of their rank. Mulla 'Ali Qari has tiar- <br>rated on the authority of 'Tirmizi' (a book of Hadith) that. <br>in the presence of Almighty Allah, the Holy Qur'iin will <br>beg Allah to grant an apparel to its reader. Almightv Allah <br>will give him a crown of honour. The Qur'an will again beg <br>for additional favoitrs for him. Thereupon Alrnighlv All;th <br>will award the reader a complete robe of honour. 'I'llu <br>Qur'an will again beseech Allah to be pleased with him. <br>and Almighty Allah will express His pleasure to him. <br>We find in this life that the pleasure of the belovt:d is <br>considered to be the most coveted gift. Similarly ill the life <br>Hereafter, no bountv shall stand comparison with the <br>pleasure of our ljeloved Alnlighty Allah. And in c a w  of <br>those who ignore their duty towards the Qur'an. it will <br>challenge them saving, \"Did you care for me'? Ilid vou fullil <br>your obligations towards me?\" <br>It has been reported on the authority of Irnnrn Abu <br>Hariifa (Rahn~atullah alaih) in 'Ihya' that it is the clue right <br>of the Qur'an that it should be read completely tu' <br>,I<br>year. Those of us who never care to reaci the Qur'an shoultl <br>first consider how they will defend themselves agilir~st <br>such a strong plaintiff. Death is inevitable and thew (:an l)e <br>no escape from it. <br>The meaning of the expression \"exterior and interior of <br>the Qur'an\" is evident. The Qur'an has an apparcxlt mean- <br>ing which can be understood by all. but the doepcr spiri- <br>tual significance is not understood by everybody. It is in <br>this connection that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said: \"Whosoever expresses his personal opinion <br>in respect of anything .in the dur'an commits <br>niistake. <br>even if he be right in his opinion.\" <br>Some scholars hold that the word 'exterior'. refers to <br>its words, which can be recited properlv by evervbodv and <br>the word 'interior', i.e., spirit, refers to its n~eanings. and its <br>underlying ideas, the understanding of which varies with <br>the ability of the readers. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If vou <br>seek knowledge, you should meditate on the meanings of <br>I <br>the Qur'an, because it embodies the history of former as <br>well as of latter times.\" It is, however, essential to observe <br>the pre-requisites for interpreting the Qur'an. An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word <br>has several meanings. A person may be knowing <br>only one or two of them, though in a given context <br>the gctual meaning may be quite different.\" <br>(2) \t Nahw, i.e., syntax, a branch of grammar. w11ic:h <br>helps in understanding the relation of a sentence <br>with another and also of I'raab (vowel sounds) of <br>the letters of a word. A change in I'raab often <br>means a change in the meaning. <br>(3) Sarf. i.e., et$mology, a branch of grammar, which <br>helps in knowing the root words and conjugations. <br>The moaning of a word changes with the change in <br>the root and with a change in its conjugation. <br>Ibri Faris (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One who loses the <br>knowledge of etymology loses a great deal.\" 'Allamah <br>Zamakhshari (Rahmatullah alaih) mentions that, when a <br>certain person set to translate the ayat- <br>On the day that We shall call each and every people <br>after their leader, <br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta- <br>phors become known. <br>(7) \t llrnul Badee', i.e., knowledge of rhetoric, the <br>knowledge which reveals the beauty of language <br>and its implications. <br>The last three are the branches of Ilmul Balaaghah <br>(knowledge of oratory), clnd are considered very important <br>subjects, which a cornmelltator should master, because the <br>Glorious Qur'an is a perfect miracle and its amazing con- <br>structions can only be understood after mastering these <br>subjects. <br>(8) \t llmul Qirrta'ah, i.e., knowledge of the art of pro- <br>nunciation. because different methods of recita-<br>ti011 sc~metimes convey different meanings, anci <br>so~nekimesone meaning is to be preferred over the <br>other. <br>(9) \t IlmuJ Aqaa'id, i.e.,knowledge of the fundamentals <br>of faith. This is necessarv to explain certain ana- <br>logies. The literal meaning of certain ayaat refer- <br>ring to Almighty Allah is not the correct one. For <br>example, the analogy in the ayat-- <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>(The hand of Allah is over their hands) <br>will have to be explained because Allah has no physical <br>hands. <br>(10)Usoolul Fiqh i.e., Prin~iples of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence. These are necessary for reasoning out and <br>finding arguments in the basic support of state-<br>ments. <br>(11)Asbaabun Nuzool, i.e., the particular circum-<br>stances which caused revelation. The meaning of <br>an ayat will be better understood if we know how <br>arid when it had been revealed. Someti~nes the <br>true meaning of an ayat is understood only if we <br>know the circumstances in which the ayat had <br>been revealed. <br>(12)An Naasikh wal Mansookh, i.e., knowledge of <br>commandments that have subsequently been abro- <br>gated or changed. so that abrogated command-<br>ments may be distinguished from the standing <br>ones. <br>(13)IImul Fiqh, i.e., knowledge of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence, because it is only through this knowledge <br>that' we arrive at a complete understanding of gen- <br>eral principles. <br>(14)Knowledge of such ahadith that happen to be com- <br>mentary on cerfain brief verses of the Qur'an. <br>(15)The last but most important is the Wahbi ilm, or <br>the gifted understanding, bestowed by Almighty <br>Allah upon Ilis selected ones, as is referred in the <br>hadith-<br>Whosoever acts upon what he knows, Almighty Allah <br>bestows upon him the knowledge of things not known <br>to him. <br>. <br>It is this special understanding that was implied in the <br>reply of Hadhrat 'Ali (Karramallaahu wajhahu) (may Allah <br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe-wasallam). <br>Allamah Suyuti says that those who think that it is <br>beyond the capacity of a man to acquire Wahbi ilm, or <br>gifted understanding, are not right. To get this k~iowledge <br>from Allah, one should adopt the means to this end, e.g., <br>acting upon the kllowledge that one has acquired, and dis- <br>inclination towards the world. <br>It is stated in 'Keemiyaa-e-Sa'aadat' that three persons <br>are not blessed with complete understanding of the Qur'an. <br>First, one who is not well versed in Arabic, seco~ldly, one <br>who persists in committing a major sin or indulges in act of <br>religious innovation, because these actions blacken his <br>heart, which in turn prevents him from understanding the <br>Qur'an. Thirdly, one who is a rationalist, even in the niatter <br>of faith, and feels enibarassed when he reads an ayat of the <br>Qur'a~i which he is not able to fully rationalize. <br>May Allah protect us from all such sins and evils. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>there is a tradition in Musnad Ahmad- <br>Till he reads of whatever Qur'an is with him. <br>This word more clearly refers to a hafiz, although a <br>reader who remains very often engaged in reciting the <br>Qur'an inay also be implied. <br>It is written in ' ~ i 6 a a t '  <br>that this hadith does not apply <br>to a reader who is accursed by the Qur'an. This is with re- <br>ference to the hadith that there are many readers of the <br>Qur'an who read the Qur'an but the Qur'an invokes curses <br>upon them. Therefore, the reading of Qur'an by a person <br>who does not adhere to the correct tenets does not consti- <br>tutc ar! argument that he is acceptable to Allah. Many Aha- <br>dith of this type relate to the Khawarij (a sect who were <br>opposed to Hadhrat 'Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>In this conimentary, Shah Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) has written that 'tarteel' literally means reading with <br>good and clear pronunciation, while according to Islamic <br>pri~ciplesit means reading in accordance with certain <br>rdes as follows: <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the <br>liver likes sweet things. Therefore, if a perfume is used at <br>the time of recitation, it will have a better influence on the <br>heart. <br>(6) Tashdeed ( (5) ) (doubling of letters) and madd ( (3) ) <br>(prolongation of letters) should be fully pro-<br>nounced because this reveals the grandeur of the <br>Qur'an and adds to its effectiveness. <br>(7) \t As stated earlier, the reader's heart should respond <br>to the ayat indicating mercy of Allah or chastise- <br>ment by Him. <br>The aboce-me~~tioned <br>seven rules constitute the cor- <br>rect way of reciting the Qur'an, which is called tarteel, and <br>the sole object of all this is to reach the correct understand- <br>ing and grasp of the deeper meaning of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Hadhrat Umm-e-Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>once askecl by someone as to how Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>aleihe wasallam) used to recite Qur'an. She said, \"In a way <br>that all vowel sounds were clear and the pronunciation of <br>each letter was distinct.\" It is desirable to recite the Qur'an <br>with propriety even if one may not understand the mean- <br>ing. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that he preferred <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari- <br>ously reported'to be 204,14,19,25,36. <br>It is written in 'Sharhul-Ihya' that each ayat corre-<br>sponds to a higher level in Paradise. So a reader will be <br>asked to ascend according to his recitation. One who reads <br>the whole of the Qur'an will attain the highest level in Par- <br>adise. And one who knows only a part of the Qur'an will <br>rise up to the proportionate level. In brief, the stage or level <br>reached will be fixed by the number of ayaat recited. <br>According to my understanding, the above hadith has <br>a different meaning- <br>(If my interpretation is corect, it is from Allah and, if it <br>is wrong, it is from me and from Satan, and Allah and <br>His Prophet are free from it.) <br>I think that the elevation implied in this hadith is not <br>that which can be determined by the number of ayat to be <br>recited. i.e., when one ayat be recited, the status will be <br>raised by one step, whether it be read with propriety or</p></div>"

So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life.

The Qur'an contains nothing that is doubt- <br>ful or crooked. It is absolutely straight, and authority and <br>I <br>Nur (enlightenment) for the believers. Abundant and per- <br>fect salutation be on Muhammad Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) (blessing and peace from Allah be upon <br>him), the person who is the best of all creation, whose Nur <br>illuminated the hearts of the living and their graves after <br>I <br>death, whose appearance was a bounty for the whole uni- <br>j<br>verse. Peace be upon his descendants and Companions, <br>who are the stars of guidance and propagators of the Holy <br>t <br>Qur'an, and also upon those believers who are their fol- <br>lowers in faith. <br>After this praise and salutation, I (the author), Zaka- <br>i <br>riyya, son of Yahya. son of Isma'il, state that these hur- <br>I<br>I <br>FOREWORD <br>riedly written pages contain forty ahadith (Plural of <br>hadith-a saying of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam)), which I have compiled on virtues of the Holy <br>Qur',an, in obedience to such people whose words are law <br>for me and following whom is most valuable to me. One of <br>3 3 <br>I--<br>the special favours of Allah, the Sanctified and Pure, which <br>have always descended upon the higher Madrasah (relig- ;&<br>ious school) of Mazahir-ul-Ulum, Saharanpur, has been the <br>@ Q<br>annual gathering of this Madrasah for the purpose of briefly <br>Fx <br>mentioning the progress of the institution. For this gather- <br>ing at the Madrasah, not much effort is made to collect <br>speakers, preachers and the famous people of India, but <br>more attention is paid to invite men whose hearts are full <br>of love for Allah and Masha'ikh (saintly people) who prefer <br>to live unknown. Although those days have receded in the <br>past when 'Hujjat-ul-Islam' (a title meaning a great author- <br>ity on Islam) Maulana Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi Saheb <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) and Qutbul Irshad (a title meaning a <br>great savant) Hadhrat Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ganghoi <br>Saheb (Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to honour this <br>gathering with their presence and illuminate the hearts of <br>all who attended, and the scene has not yet disappeared <br>from the eyes when the spiritual descendants of those revi- <br>valists of Islam-Hadhrat <br>Shaikh-ul-Hind (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), Hadhrat Shah Abdur Rahim (Rahmatullah alaih), <br>Hadhrat Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saheb (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), and Hadhrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi Saheb <br>(Nawwarallahu marqadahu) used to assemble at the annual <br>gathering of the Madrasah. Their presence was a fountain <br>source of life and light for deadened souls and quenched <br>the thirst of those who sought Divine love. <br>At present, though the annual gatherings do not have <br>the illuminations of even such sources of guidance, their <br>true spiritual descendants still honour these gatherings <br>with their presence and enrich the audience with bounties <br>and blessings. The people who attended the gathering this <br>year are witnesses to this. Only those who possess eyes that <br>see can experience the effulgence, but sightless beings like <br>us can also feel something unusual. <br>At the annual gathering of this Madrasah, if a person <br>comes to listen to polished speeches and forceful lectures, <br>he will perhaps not return so much happy as one who <br>seeks a balm for his heart. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>All praise and supplication is for Allah. <br>In the same connection, during this year on 27th Zil- <br>qa'dah (name of the eleventh month of Islamic calendar), <br>1348 Hijri, Hadhrat Shah Hafiz Mohammad Yasin Naginwi <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) visited the Madrasah. His coming was <br>like a shower of affection and kindness, and I cannot ad- <br>equately thank him for this. After knowing about him that -<br>I <br>he is one of the spiritual heirs of Hadhrat Gangohi (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih), there is no need of mentioning his fine quali- <br>ties of devotion and piety, and the presence of Anwaar <br>(Plural of 'Nu'-enlightenment and blessings) in his own <br>person. When this gathering was over, he returned home <br>and honoured me with a kind letter asking me to compile <br>forty ahadith regarding the virtues of the Glorious Quran <br>and send them to him along with their translations. He also <br>wrote to me that, if I did not carry out his wishes, he would <br>ask the successor to my Shaikh (teacher) and elderly uncle, <br>Maulana Hafiz Alhaj Maulvi Mohammad Ilyas (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih), to confirm this order of his. He made it certain <br>that he wanted me to do this job. Incidentally, I received <br>I <br>that honourdd message when I was out travelling and my <br>uncle was present (at Saharanpur). On my return, my uncle <br>gave this letter to me along with his own firm orders for <br>compliance. Now there was no occasion for me for any <br>I<br>excuse or to plead lack of ability. Although my occupation <br>with the commentary of 'Mo'atta' (a book of Ahadith) of <br>Imam Malik (Rahmatullah alaih) was a good excuse, I had <br>to postpone that work for a few days and, in compliance <br>with the urgent orders, produce my effort for his esteemed <br>consideration. I beg to be excused for such shortcomings as <br>are inevitable because of my incompetence. +\\<br>& & 2 --&,& &\\ <br>'& JG 2 & 2 <br>;&j <br>r h <br>, <br>$ >  <br>au d\\<br>t%3 &<br>j<br>f<br>~4, & <br>3, q+ $j\\<br>,-. <br>i;<br>-.<br>'&\\ <br>$J <br>A. r<br>, <br>9,<br>' \\*<br>h.&: <br>56 Lf.J, <br>>, Gj <br>j& u; JG <br>.$ &,&;$ <br>d!j +&\\2 i j ~ j&$ <br>, -<br>Ji+ <br>: <br>L!j 4<br> #\\ ,.<br>- ,  <br>.<br>O <br>d j  <br>JG; <br>&\\&j <br>2 9;<br>JJ, <br>J,,$2 +g3 * <br>J<br>,& <br>@ &\\ ;<br>\\<br> <br>, <br>,<br>, <br>'$ I&& <br>> <br>$$; &+\\; <br>@$,<br>. -<br>&+ <br>$\\<br>-<br>,<br>< <br><br>FOREWORD <br>.. .' \".*<br>6-+ MJ\\<br>,...&<br>+vj<br> ,,&<br>.+<br> i,,w,J,<br>-.. <br>&ii<br>. <br>.. <br>& 3 \\ j  A$\\<br>?& <br>Q,s ~ i lL>, gG91*>j -3, 5 x<br>- .  <br>J! $jp ,.> 3 &b\\<br>Lj * *$, . .,$!&,jc <br>Lj<br>J <br>ail$\\ <br>&@ <br>?*ii<br>. .

So any <br>one writing them in the form of a book and passing them <br>on to others will also be covered by the blessings men- <br>tioned in this 'hadith.' <br>Munaawi (Rahmatullah alaih) is of the opinion that <br>\"preserve for my Ummat\" means reporting of a hadith <br>along with its authority. According to some, \"preserve\" in- <br>cludes even those who are reporting it to other Muslims <br>without memorizing it or even Without knowing its mean- <br>ings. Also the expression \"forty ahadith\" has been used in <br>general sense, i.e., these ahadith may be all sahih (authen- <br>tic), hasan (correct) or even da'if (weak) to the degree that <br>can be acted upon because of their virtues. <br>Allaho akbar! (How great Allah is!). Many are the fa- <br>cilities provided in Islam. And commendable indeed has <br>been the role of scholars and theologians who took such <br>pains to explain the subtleties of various expressions. May <br>Almighty Allah bless us all with perfection in Islam. <br>Virtues'of the Holy Qur'an <br>It is important to note that whenever I have quoted a <br>hadith without mentioning'the name of the book, it should <br>be deemed to have been taken from one of the five books, <br>viz., 'Al-Mishkat', 'Tanqih-ur-Ruwat', 'Al-Mirqat'. 'Sharah- <br>ul-Ihya' and 'At-Targhib' of Mundhiri, on which I have <br>relied and from which I have drawn extensively. Whenever <br>I have quoted from any other book, the source has been <br>mentioned. <br>It is incumbent upon the reader of the Qur'an to ob- <br>serve the rules of reverence for its recitation. <br>Before proceeding further, it seems desirable to men- <br>tion first some of the requirements of decorum for reading <br>of the Holy Qur'an; because, as admitted. <br>One who is devoid of reverence misses Allah's special <br>favour, <br>In brief, the essence of all the rules of reverence is to <br>consider the Glorious Qur'an as the words of Almighty <br>Allah. Whorq we worship, and as the Word of One Whom <br>we love and seek. <br>Those who have ever experieced love, know how <br>worthy of adoration is a letter or speech of the beloved. The <br>ecstatic raptures caused by such a communication are <br>beyond all rules of propriety because, as it is said. <br>Love itself will teach one the rules of conduct in love. <br>So, while reading the Qur'an, if we attempt to \"isualise <br>the real beauty and limitless bounty of our Beloved Allah, <br>our hearts will be swayed by emotions of heavenly love. At <br>the same tine, the Qur'an is the Word of the Master of mas- <br>ters and thacommands of the Emperor of all kings. It is the <br>law promulgated by the All-powerful Monarch, Who re-<br>mains unequalled for ever. Those who have served at the <br>courts of kings know by experience, while others can just <br>visualise the extreme awe insprired by the king's orders. <br>FOREWORD <br>The Qur'an is the word of our Beloved Lord, Who is also <br>the Supreme Monarch. We should, therefore read the <br>Qur'an with the emotions of love and awe. <br>It is said that whenever Hadhrat 'Ikramah (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) (may Allah be pleased with him) opened the <br>Book for recitation, he became unconscious and fell down. <br>Then he would utter, <br>\"This is the Word of my Allah, this is the Word of my <br>Allah.\" <br>The aforesaid contains briefly the spirit of the require- <br>ments of decorum as written in great detail by the Muslim <br>scholars. It will further be explained in the following para- <br>graphs. In short, a Muslim should read the book of Allah <br>not just as a servant, but as a slave in the spirit of complete <br>humility towards his Lord, Master and Benefactor. The <br>Sufia (Plural of Sufi-mystic) have written that, if a person <br>feels his shortcomings in exercising due respect and rever- <br>ence while reciting the Qur'an, he will continue to progress <br>along the path of nearness to Almighty Allah but a person <br>who regards himself with approval or pride will not ad- <br>vance further. <br>Rules of Revere~re for readivg the Holy Qur'an <br>After cleaning the teeth with a miswak (a green twig of <br>special varieties of trees used for brushing the teeth) and <br>wudhu (ablution), one should sit in a quite place with <br>grace and humility and face towards Qiblah (direction to- <br>wards the Ka'bah in Mecca). Then, with an attentive heart, <br>deep devotion and zest befitting the occasion, one should <br>recite, imagining all the time that he is reciting it to <br>Almighty Allah. If one understands the meaning, one <br>should pause and reflect on ayaat (Plural of 'ayat'-a verse <br>of the Qur'an) of promise and mercy and should beg for His <br>forgiveness and compassion. On ayaat of punishment and <br>admonition, one should seek His refuge, as except Him <br>there is no Helper. On ayaat pertaining to His Majesty and <br>Sanctity, one should say \"Subhaanallah\" (Glory to Allah). <br>If one does not spontaneously shed tears while reading the <br>Book, one must induce oneself to weep a little. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an \t<br>For a lover, the moments of greatest pleasure are those <br>when, in the presence of his beloved, he is full of self- <br>reproach and shedding tears profusely. <br>One should not read fast unless one desires to memor- <br>I <br>ize it. The Qu'ran should be placed in a slightly elevated <br>position on a wooden stand or a pillow. One should not <br>talk to others during recitation. If one is forced by necessity <br>to speak to someone, it should be done after first closing <br>the Book, and then recite 'Ta'awwudh' (seeking refuge of <br>Allah against Satan), before reading again. If people nearby <br>are occupied in their work, reading in a low voice is appre- <br>ciated otherwise reading loudly is more rewarding. <br>The Masha'ikh have mentioned six external and six in- <br>ternal rules of reverence for reading the Holy Qu'ran, <br>which are given below: <br>I <br>Rules of External Iieverence <br>(1) Perform Wudhu and then sit facing Qiblah in an <br>extremely dignified manner. <br>(2) \t Do not proceed fast, but read with measure and <br>correct pronunciation. <br>(3) \t Try to weep, even if vou have to compel yourself <br>to do so. <br>(4) \t The response to ayaat of mercy or 01 punishment<br>should be as explained above. <br>(5) \t Reading should be in a low vo~ce. if insincerity is <br>apprehended on your own part or disturbance is <br>caused to others. Otherwise read in a loud voice. <br>(6) Read in a melodious voice, because there are nu- \t<br>v <br>merous ahadith laying emphasis on this. <br>Rules oflnternal Reverence <br>(1) The heart should be full of the glory of Qur'an i.e. <br>realizing how sublime it is. <br>(2) \t Bear in the heart the Loftiness, Majesty and Mag- <br>nificence of Almighty Allah, Whose Revelation the <br>Qu'ran is. <br>FOREWORD <br>(3) \t The heart should be free from distraction and <br>doubts. <br>(4) Dwell upon the meanings and enjoy reading it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once spent the <br>whole night reading over and over again the following ayat: <br>If Thou should chastise them, they are Thy servants, <br>and if Thou should forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, <br>the Wise (V: 118). <br>Once, Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Jubair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>spent the whole night repeating the following ayat: <br>And withdraw aside today, 0 guilty ones! (XXXVI: 59). <br>(5) \t Submit your heart to the subject-matter of the <br>verses you are reading. For instance, on ayaat con- <br>taining a message of mercy, the heart should be <br>filled with delight. And on ayaat of chastisement, <br>the heart should tremble with awe. <br>(6) The \t ears should be made as attentive as if <br>Almighty Allah Himself is speaking and the reader <br>is listening to Him. <br>May Allah, out of His mercy and kindness, grant all of <br>us the ability to read the Qu'ran according to these rules of <br>reverence. <br>A Heligious Principle <br>The memorizing of that much of the C;lorious Qu'ran <br>as is necessary for the offering of salaat is obligatory for <br>every Muslim, whereas memorizing the whole of the Holy <br>Qur'an is Fard Kifavah, i.e. an act obligatory on all, but <br>which may suffice if performed by an adequate number. If <br>there were not a single hafiz (may Allah forbid) all the <br>Muslims would be held responsible for this sin. Mulla'Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has further reported from Zarka- <br>shi (Rahmatullah alaih] that if, in a town or a village, there <br>were no person to read the Holy Qur'an, all the Muslim in- <br>habitants of that place would be considered sinful. In this <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>age of darkness and ignorance when the Muslims have <br>boc:ome misguided in respet:t of manv aspects of Islam, it is <br>gr:nerally (:onsidered useless and stupid to nlemorize the <br>Qur'an and a sheer waste of time and mental energy to <br>repeat its words without understanding their meaning. If <br>this were the only case of our aversion to faith, something <br>in detail could be written about it. But today all our acts <br>are erring and all our thoughts are leading us astray. For <br>how manv should one wail and about how many should <br>one complain. <br>So to Allah do we complain and from Him do we seek <br>help. <br>I <br>I <br>t <br><br>PART I <br>FORTY AHADITH <br>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>amongst you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it.\" <br>In most of the books, this hadith is quoted with the word <br>'and' between 'learns' and 'teaches' as above. Thus the <br>greatest reward would be for him who learns the Holy <br>Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of <br>the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in <br>which case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you <br>is he who learns the Qur'an or teaches it.\" <br>Accbrding to this version, the reward is general, i.e., <br>equally great whether one learns himself or teaches to <br>others. Thus there would be equal virtue for both. <br>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on <br>the preservation and propagation of the Qur'an depends <br>the .very existence of this faith. Hence the virtue of learning <br>and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident and does not need <br>further elucidation. <br>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The <br>highest is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and <br>purport, and the least is to learn its words only. <br>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by an- <br>other saying of Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>reported by Hadhrat Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho <br>anho): \"If a person who has acquired knowledge of the <br>Holy Qur'an considers another person who has been gifted <br>with something else to be more fortunate than himself, he <br>has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>him on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident <br>that since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior <br>to all other discourses as mentioned in some of the ahadith <br>quoted later, its reading and teaching must be superior to <br>everything else. <br>Mulla Ali Qari quotes from another hadith that who- <br>ever acquires the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the <br>knowledge of prophethood in his forehead. <br>Sahl 'i'astari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of <br>love for Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah <br>in one's heart. <br>In 'Sharhul Ihya', the list of people who will be given <br>shelter in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the <br>fearful Day of Judgement includes those persons who teach <br>the Qur'an to the children of Muslims and also those who <br>learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood and are devoted <br>to its recitation when grown up. <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallahotalaihe wasallam) said: \"Almighty <br>Allah says; \"If anybody finds no time for My remembrance <br>and for begging favours of Me, because of his remaining <br>busy with the Holy Qur'an, I shall give him more than what <br>I give to all those who beg favours of Me. The superiority of <br>the Word of Allah over all other words is like the super- <br>iority of Allah over the entire creation. <br>In other words, compared to those who are begging <br>favours of Allah, He will surely confer some better reward <br>on a person who remains so occupied with committing the <br>Qur'an to memory or learning and understanding it that he <br>hardly gets time for du'a (prayer). <br>It is commonly known that when a man distributes <br>sweets, or something else amongst others, a share is set <br>Part I [Hadith 3) <br>aside for the person who cannot attend the function be- <br>cause of the task of distribution given to him by the dis- <br>tributor himself. In another hadith, in the same context, it <br>is mentioned that Allah would give such a person a better <br>2 5<br>reward than what He would give to His ever grateful ser- <br>=-a <br>vants. <br>;!3 <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Hadhrat 'Uqbah ibn Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>has said: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>came to us while we were sitting on the Suffah and <br>asked if any one of us would like to go to the market of <br>But-haan or Aqeeq and fetch from there two she-<br>camels of the finest breed without commiting any sin <br>or severing a tie of kinship. We replied that everyone <br>of us would love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) then said that going to the musjid and recit- <br>ing or teaching two ayaat of the Qur'an is more pre- <br>cious than two she-camels, three ayaat are most <br>precious than three she-camels, and that similarly re- <br>citing or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she- <br>camels and an equal number of camels.\" <br>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform in <br>the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) in Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim <br>muhajirin (Plural of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to <br>Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" (Men of <br>Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: <br>'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hun- <br>dred and one names and also written an independent book- <br>let about their names. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>But-han arid Aqeeq were the two market-places for <br>camels near Medilia. 'l'he camel, more particularly a she- <br>camel having a fat hump, was a favourite of the Arabs. <br>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing <br>can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through <br>illegal inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of <br>some relative) or by theft. Kasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thus ruled out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a <br>thing without any sin is certainly preferred by all, but <br>much more valuable is the learning of a few ayaat. <br>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even <br>if one acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one <br>will be forced to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at <br>the time of death), but the reward of one ayat will be ever- <br>lasting. We see even in this life that a man feels happier <br>when he is given only one rupee (without the condition of <br>returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand rupees <br>for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the <br>latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without get- <br>ting any benefit out of it. in fact, this hadith implies an <br>admonition not to compare something temporary with <br>sonlething eternal. Whether in action or at rest, a man <br>should corisider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring <br>the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards <br>achieving the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of <br>effort for which we earn eternal misery. The last phrase of <br>the hadith \"superior to an equal number of camels\" con-<br>tains three meanings. First, upto the number four, the <br>reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is <br>brieflv mentioned t h d  the more ayaat a person acquires, <br>the greater will be their superiority over the number of <br>camels. In this case, the word \"camels\" at the end refers to <br>the species-either <br>he-camels or she-camels-and <br>the <br>number implied is more than four because, upto the <br>number four. the reward has been mentioned in detail. The <br>second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the <br>same as referred to earlier, the significance being that incli- <br>nations are always different; some are fond of she-camels, <br>others prefer a he-camel. Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has used this expression to signify that <br>every ayat is superior to a she-camel, and if one prefers a <br>he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. The third <br>meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as re- <br>ferred to before and not more than four. According to the <br>Part I (Hadith 4) <br>second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is superior to <br>a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies <br>a collection, i.e.. one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a <br>she-camel considered together, and likewise every ayat is <br>superior to the combination of an equal number of he-<br>camels or she-camels. Thus a single ayat has been com-<br>pared to a pair or couple (of camels). My late father (May <br>Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has preferred the <br>latter interpretation because it points to a superior virtue. <br>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can <br>be equalled to a camel or two camels. All this is for induce- <br>ment arid illustration. It has been clearly written before that <br>an ayat whose reward is permanent and enduring is <br>superior and preferable even to a kingdoni over the seven <br>continents. which is bound to disintegrate. <br>Mulla 'Ali Qari has writteri an account of a pious <br>Shaikh who went to Mecca for Hajj on the 9th day of Dhul <br>Hijjah--the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. When he <br>landed at Jicldah, some of his friends in business requested <br>him to prolo~ig his stav in Jiddah, so that they could earn <br>more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his blesskd <br>presence. In fact thev wanted that some of the servants of <br>the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. At <br>first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay. <br>but when thev insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the <br>maximum profit that they woutd earn for their goods. Thev <br>explained that the profit was r7t the same in all cases; but <br>the maximum that they could expect was hundred per <br>cent. The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for <br>such a petty gain: for such ari insignificant gain. I cannot <br>miss the salaat in the respected Harani (the most Sacred <br>Mosque), where the reward of salaat gets multiplie(l one <br>hundred thousand times.\" 111 fact, we Muslims should con- <br>sider how, for petty worldly gains, we some~imes sacrifice <br>great spiritual benefits. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>1.9 <br>Iladhrat 'Aa'ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said. <br>\"One who is well versed in the Qilr'an will be in the <br>c:ompanv of those angels who are scrihes, noble and <br>righteous; and one who falters in reading the Qur'an, <br>-<br>and has to exert hard for learning, gets double the <br>reward.\" <br>\"Orie who is well versed in the Qur'an\" means one <br>\\vho is proficierit in riiemorizitlg as well as in reciting it. It <br>is highly praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and sig- <br>nifir:anc:e as well. \"To be with the angels\" means that, like <br>tht? i~ngels who transferred tlie Qur'a~i from the. Lowhul <br>Mahfooz' (Protectetl 'I'ablet in the Heavens), he also (:on- <br>\\lovs it to othors through its recitatioti and, therefore, both <br>Ilave the salnc occupation; or that he will join the company <br>of such angels on the Day of Judgement. One who faltcrs <br>ivill get double reward-olio for his reading and the other <br>tor liis effort in readi~tg the Qur'an, in spite of fitltt?~.i~~g <br>ag,lin atid again. It does liot rnean that liis reward will <br>c:xc.eed that of a well-versed person. The reward tliot is <br>mt:ntioned for a well-versed person is far gleater. so nluc:h <br>so that he ivill be in the company of special angels. 'The ex- <br>plii~iation is that the labour involved in faltering and tlie <br>tlifficllltics in the reading of the Qur'an carry an indeperi- <br>don1 reward. As such, reading of the Qur'ali should not be <br>given up, even though faltering 1lliiv be ail excuse. <br>M ~ ~ I 1 ; ~<br>'Ali Qari has reproduc:t?ci fmm the riwbyat of Ta-<br>broni and Unihaqi that one ~ ~ 1 1 0<br>(:a11110t menlorizt* the <br>(211r'an well and yet persists i l l  loarning it by heart gets <br>doi~blt: reward. Sitnilarly, one who cherishes a longing for <br>111cmorizi.ingit and does not posst!ss the iibilitv to do so, but <br>doc.s not give up his efforts. will t)e reckoned by Almighty <br>hllah atnorig the hl~ffaili! (Plural of hafiz-one who has <br>laarnt !he whole Qur'an hv heart) on the Day of Kesurrec- <br>t ion. <br>$r <br>Part I (Hadith 6) <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Hasad <br>(jealousy) is not permitted except in respect of two <br>persons-one whom Allah blesses with recitation of <br>a = <br>Qur'an and he remains engaged in it day and night, = ar <br>and the other who is given a lot of wealth by Allah and <br>he spends it day and night.\" <br>;$<br>c*<br>On the authority of many ayaat of the Qur'an and nu- <br>g<br>merous ahadith, hasad is an evil and is absolutely forbid- <br>den. This hadith, however appears to permit hasad in <br>respect of two persons. Because there are many well-known <br>traditions dealing with hasad, the Ulama (Plural of aalim- <br>religious scholar) have interpreted this hadith in two ways. <br>Firstly, hasad as denoted by the Arabic word 'ghibtah', is <br>taken here in the sense of emulation. There is a difference <br>between jealousy and emulation. Hasad is a desire that one <br>possessing a blessing should be deprived of it: whether the <br>person who feels jealous acquires it or not, while emu-<br>lation signifies a desire to possess a thing, whether the <br>actual owner is deprived of it or not. Since hasad is haram <br>(religiously unlawful) under Ijma (consensus of opiniod), <br>the Ulama have translated, by way of metaphor, this word <br>hasad as ghibtah, meaning emulation. Ghibtah is permiss- <br>ible in worldly affairs and commendable in religious mat- <br>ters. <br>The second interpretation is that the term hasad has <br>been used in a hypothetical sense, i.e., if hasad were per- <br>missible it would have been so with regard to the two per- <br>sons mentioned above. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Musa (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"The example of a mo'min (believer) who reads the <br>Qur'an is like that of citron which has a pleasant smell <br>and a sweet taste. The example of a mo'min who does <br>not read the Qur'an is like that of a date, which has no <br>smell, though its taste is sweet. The munafiq (hyp- <br>ocrite) who does not read the Qur'an is like a wild <br>gourd, which has a bitter taste and no smell, and the <br>munafiq who reads the Qur'an is like a raihan [sweet- <br>smelling flower), which is fragrant but has a bitter <br>taste.\" <br>In this hadith an abstract quality of reading the Glor- <br>ious Qur'an, has been compared to concrete objects in <br>order to illustrate the difference between reading and not <br>reading the tIoly Qur'an. Otherwise it is obvious that ma- <br>terial objects of this world like citrons and dates cannot <br>match the sweetness and perfume of the Qur'an. There are, <br>however, special points in this similitude, which pertain to <br>the deep knowledge of the Prophets and testify to the vast <br>understanding of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Consider, for example, the citron, which gives flavour to <br>the mouth, cleans the stomach and stimulates digestion. <br>These are the qualities specially associated with the <br>reading of the Qur'an since, fragrance in the mouth. inter- <br>nal purity and spiritual strength result from reading the <br>Qur'an. It is also said that if there is citron in the house, no <br>jinn can enter it. If it is true. then such is the speciality of <br>the Qur'an. Some physicians say that citron strengthens the <br>memory and it is rep'orted in 'Ihya' by Hadhrat Ali (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) that three things, i.e., cleaning the teeth <br>with miswak, fasting and reading the Holy Qur'an <br>strengthen the memory. <br>i <br>In the book of Abu Dawood, it is mentioned at the con- <br>clusion of the hadith given above that a good companion is <br>like a person having musk. Even if vou do not get musk, <br>you will at least enloy its fragrance. An evil companion is <br>like a person with a furnace, near whom, even if you do not <br>get blac:kened, vou certainly cannot avoid the smoke. It is, <br>/i<br>therefore. important that one should be very careful in <br>choosing his companions, with whom he has to mix gener- <br>I <br>ally. <br>i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 7) <br>,I <br>i <br>> <br>...,,<br>b, <br>$>&l3!& <br>$1 J$, JGJ & ~ ~ - + U ~<br>J .  <br>;r-; 9 'p (V) -\"L <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyal~aho anho) narrates that Ra- is <br>sullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Allah <br>E 3  <br>exalts many people by means of this Book (the Holy sa <br>Qu'ran), and He also degrades and disgraces many <br>others by means of the same.\" <br>People who believe in the Holy Book and act upon it <br>are given by Allah position of honour and respect, both in <br>this life as well as in the Hereafter, while those who do not <br>act upon it are disgraced by Allah. This principle is also <br>borne out by the various ayaat of the Holy Qur'an. At one <br>place it reads: <br>\"He misleads many by this Book and guides many <br>thereby.\" <br>At another place we come across: <br>\"And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a <br>healing and mercy for believers, though it increases for <br>the evil-doers naught save ruin.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re- <br>ported to have said: \"Many hypocrites of this Ummat will <br>be the qurraa, i.e., those who recite the Qur'an correctly.\" <br>In 'Ihya-ul-Ulum' it is reported ffom some Mashaa'ikh. \"As <br>soon as a man starts reading a surah (chapter of the Holy <br>Qur'an), the Angels start invoking mercy for him and they <br>continue to do so till he stops reading; on the contrary an- <br>other person starts reading a surah and the Angels start <br>cursing him and they continue to do so till he completes <br>the reading.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that sometimes a man reads <br>the Holy Qur'an and invokes curses on himself without <br>even knowing it. For instance, he reads in the Holy Qur'an: <br>Virtues of the Htdy Qur'an <br>\"Beware, the curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers\" <br>and he exposes himself to this warning because of his wrong- <br>doings. <br>In the like manner, he reads in the Qur'an: <br>\"The curse of Allah is upon the liars\". <br>In fact he exposes himself to the warning by reason of <br>his being himself a liar. <br>'Aamir ibn Waathilah (Radhiyallaho anho) say$ that <br>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhivallaho anho) had appointed Naafi' <br>ibn Abdul Harith as the Governor of Mecca. Once he asked <br>the latter as to whom he had appointed as the administra- <br>tor of forests. \"Ibn Abzi\" replied Naafi'. \"Who is Ibn-e- <br>Abzi?\" said Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho). \"He is <br>one of our slaves\" was the reply. \"Why have you appointed <br>a slave the ameer (leader)?\" objected Hadhrat 'Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho an\\ho). \"Because he recites the Book of Allah\" <br>said Naafi'. At this, Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrated the hadith that it had been said by Rasullullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that, because of this Book. <br>Allah elevates many people and degrades many. <br>Hadhrat 'Abdur Rahman ibn 'Auf (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \",On the Day of Judgement, three things will be <br>under the shade of the Arsh (Allah's Throne). One, the <br>Holy Qur'an which will argue with men-the Qur'an <br>has both an exterior and an interior. The second will <br>b <br>i <br>1t <br>! \t<br>E <br>I i <br><br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  \t<br>be amaanat (trust). The third will be kinship, which <br>shall proclaim, '0. Allah! have mercy wn the person <br>who upheld me. and deprive him of Your merry who- <br>soever severed me.' \" <br>\"Three things will be under the shade of the 'Arsh\" <br>signifies their utmost nearness in the sublime preserlce of <br>Allah. \"The Qur'an will argue\" nieans that it will pleacl tht: <br>cause of those people who read it, respect it and act upon <br>its commandments. It will intercede on their behalf and <br>solicit the upgrading of their rank. Mulla 'Ali Qari has tiar- <br>rated on the authority of 'Tirmizi' (a book of Hadith) that. <br>in the presence of Almighty Allah, the Holy Qur'iin will <br>beg Allah to grant an apparel to its reader. Almightv Allah <br>will give him a crown of honour. The Qur'an will again beg <br>for additional favoitrs for him. Thereupon Alrnighlv All;th <br>will award the reader a complete robe of honour. 'I'llu <br>Qur'an will again beseech Allah to be pleased with him. <br>and Almighty Allah will express His pleasure to him. <br>We find in this life that the pleasure of the belovt:d is <br>considered to be the most coveted gift. Similarly ill the life <br>Hereafter, no bountv shall stand comparison with the <br>pleasure of our ljeloved Alnlighty Allah. And in c a w  of <br>those who ignore their duty towards the Qur'an. it will <br>challenge them saving, \"Did you care for me'? Ilid vou fullil <br>your obligations towards me?\" <br>It has been reported on the authority of Irnnrn Abu <br>Hariifa (Rahn~atullah alaih) in 'Ihya' that it is the clue right <br>of the Qur'an that it should be read completely tu' <br>,I<br>year. Those of us who never care to reaci the Qur'an shoultl <br>first consider how they will defend themselves agilir~st <br>such a strong plaintiff. Death is inevitable and thew (:an l)e <br>no escape from it. <br>The meaning of the expression \"exterior and interior of <br>the Qur'an\" is evident. The Qur'an has an apparcxlt mean- <br>ing which can be understood by all. but the doepcr spiri- <br>tual significance is not understood by everybody. It is in <br>this connection that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) has said: \"Whosoever expresses his personal opinion <br>in respect of anything .in the dur'an commits <br>niistake. <br>even if he be right in his opinion.\" <br>Some scholars hold that the word 'exterior'. refers to <br>its words, which can be recited properlv by evervbodv and <br>the word 'interior', i.e., spirit, refers to its n~eanings. and its <br>underlying ideas, the understanding of which varies with <br>the ability of the readers. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If vou <br>seek knowledge, you should meditate on the meanings of <br>I <br>the Qur'an, because it embodies the history of former as <br>well as of latter times.\" It is, however, essential to observe <br>the pre-requisites for interpreting the Qur'an. An unbecom- <br>I<br>ing present-day fashion is that even those who possess <br>little or no knowledge of Arabic vocabulary offer their per- <br>sonal opinion on the basis of vernacular translations of the <br>Qur'an. Specialists have laid down that any one atte~npti~lg <br>I<br>a commentary of the Holy Qur'an should be well versed i11 <br>fifteen subjects. These, as briefly given below, will show <br>that it is not possible for everybody to understand the <br>underlying significance and real meanings of the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(1) Lughat, i.e., philology of language, which helps in <br>understanding the appropriate meanings of words. <br>Mujahid (Kahmatullah alaih) says, \"one who be- <br>lieves in Allah and the Day of Judgement should <br>not open his lips in respect of the Qur'an, unless <br>he is thoroughly conversant with the philology of <br>the Arabic language. Quite often an Arabic word <br>has several meanings. A person may be knowing <br>only one or two of them, though in a given context <br>the gctual meaning may be quite different.\" <br>(2) \t Nahw, i.e., syntax, a branch of grammar. w11ic:h <br>helps in understanding the relation of a sentence <br>with another and also of I'raab (vowel sounds) of <br>the letters of a word. A change in I'raab often <br>means a change in the meaning. <br>(3) Sarf. i.e., et$mology, a branch of grammar, which <br>helps in knowing the root words and conjugations. <br>The moaning of a word changes with the change in <br>the root and with a change in its conjugation. <br>Ibri Faris (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One who loses the <br>knowledge of etymology loses a great deal.\" 'Allamah <br>Zamakhshari (Rahmatullah alaih) mentions that, when a <br>certain person set to translate the ayat- <br>On the day that We shall call each and every people <br>after their leader, <br>Part I (Hadith 8) <br>he ignorantly rendered it thus: \"On the day that We shall <br>call each people after their mothers.\" He supposed that the <br>singular Arabic word 'imam' (leader) was the plural of the <br>Arabic word 'urnm' (mother). if he had been conversant <br>with etymology, he would have known that the plural of <br>'umm' is not 'imam'. <br>(4) \t Ishtiqaaq, i.e., derivatives, It is necessary to have <br>the knowledge of derivatives and their root words, <br>because if a word has been derived from two dif- <br>ferent root words, it will have two different mean- <br>ings, e.g.. the word 'maseeh' is derivable from <br>'masah' which means to touch or to move wet <br>hands over, and also from 'masaahah' which <br>means measurement. <br>(5) \t Ilrnul Ma'aani, i.e., knowledge of semantics, be- <br>cause phrase constructions are understood from <br>their meanings. <br>(6) \t Ilrnul Buyaan, i.e., knowledge of figures of speech, <br>like similes and metaphors, due to which express- <br>ions or shades of meaning or similes and meta- <br>phors become known. <br>(7) \t llrnul Badee', i.e., knowledge of rhetoric, the <br>knowledge which reveals the beauty of language <br>and its implications. <br>The last three are the branches of Ilmul Balaaghah <br>(knowledge of oratory), clnd are considered very important <br>subjects, which a cornmelltator should master, because the <br>Glorious Qur'an is a perfect miracle and its amazing con- <br>structions can only be understood after mastering these <br>subjects. <br>(8) \t llmul Qirrta'ah, i.e., knowledge of the art of pro- <br>nunciation. because different methods of recita-<br>ti011 sc~metimes convey different meanings, anci <br>so~nekimesone meaning is to be preferred over the <br>other. <br>(9) \t IlmuJ Aqaa'id, i.e.,knowledge of the fundamentals <br>of faith. This is necessarv to explain certain ana- <br>logies. The literal meaning of certain ayaat refer- <br>ring to Almighty Allah is not the correct one. For <br>example, the analogy in the ayat-- <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>(The hand of Allah is over their hands) <br>will have to be explained because Allah has no physical <br>hands. <br>(10)Usoolul Fiqh i.e., Prin~iples of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence. These are necessary for reasoning out and <br>finding arguments in the basic support of state-<br>ments. <br>(11)Asbaabun Nuzool, i.e., the particular circum-<br>stances which caused revelation. The meaning of <br>an ayat will be better understood if we know how <br>arid when it had been revealed. Someti~nes the <br>true meaning of an ayat is understood only if we <br>know the circumstances in which the ayat had <br>been revealed. <br>(12)An Naasikh wal Mansookh, i.e., knowledge of <br>commandments that have subsequently been abro- <br>gated or changed. so that abrogated command-<br>ments may be distinguished from the standing <br>ones. <br>(13)IImul Fiqh, i.e., knowledge of Islamic Jurispru- <br>dence, because it is only through this knowledge <br>that' we arrive at a complete understanding of gen- <br>eral principles. <br>(14)Knowledge of such ahadith that happen to be com- <br>mentary on cerfain brief verses of the Qur'an. <br>(15)The last but most important is the Wahbi ilm, or <br>the gifted understanding, bestowed by Almighty <br>Allah upon Ilis selected ones, as is referred in the <br>hadith-<br>Whosoever acts upon what he knows, Almighty Allah <br>bestows upon him the knowledge of things not known <br>to him. <br>. <br>It is this special understanding that was implied in the <br>reply of Hadhrat 'Ali (Karramallaahu wajhahu) (may Allah <br>Part I (Hadith 8 )  <br>be kind to him) when he was asked by the people if he had <br>received from Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) any <br>special knowledge or instructions which were not received <br>by others. Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"I swear <br>by Him Who made the Paradise and created life that 1 pos-<br>sess nothing special, except the clear understanding which <br>Almighty Allah bestows upon a person ill respect of the <br>Qur'an.\" <br>Ibri Abid Dunyaa (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the <br>knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and that which can bc de- <br>rived out of it are as vast ss a boundless ocean. <br>The branches of knowledge described above are like <br>tools, i.e. essential pre-requisite for a c.ommentator. A com- <br>mentary written by a person who is not thoroughly ac-<br>quainted with these branches of knowledge will be based <br>on his personal opinion, which is prohibited. The Sahabah <br>(Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) already had Arabic language as their mother-tongue, <br>and they reached the depth of the rest of the knowledge by <br>means of their illuminati~lg contact that they had with Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe-wasallam). <br>Allamah Suyuti says that those who think that it is <br>beyond the capacity of a man to acquire Wahbi ilm, or <br>gifted understanding, are not right. To get this k~iowledge <br>from Allah, one should adopt the means to this end, e.g., <br>acting upon the kllowledge that one has acquired, and dis- <br>inclination towards the world. <br>It is stated in 'Keemiyaa-e-Sa'aadat' that three persons <br>are not blessed with complete understanding of the Qur'an. <br>First, one who is not well versed in Arabic, seco~ldly, one <br>who persists in committing a major sin or indulges in act of <br>religious innovation, because these actions blacken his <br>heart, which in turn prevents him from understanding the <br>Qur'an. Thirdly, one who is a rationalist, even in the niatter <br>of faith, and feels enibarassed when he reads an ayat of the <br>Qur'a~i which he is not able to fully rationalize. <br>May Allah protect us from all such sins and evils. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH 9 <br>I-Iadhrat 'Abdullah ibn Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) re- <br>ports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alihe wasallam) said: <br>\"On the Day of Judgement, it will be said to the Man <br>devoted to the Qur'an, 'Go on reciting the Qur'an and <br>continue ascending the storeys of Jannat (Paradise) and <br>recite in the slow manner you had been reading in <br>worldly life; your final abode will be where you reach <br>at the time c)f the last ayat of your recitation.\" <br>\"The man of Qur'an\" apparently means a hafiz. Mulla <br>'Ali Qari has explained it fully that this honour is reserved <br>for. a!hafiz, and that this hadith does not apply to one who <br>reads by looking into the Holy Book. First, because the <br>words \"Man of Qur'an\" point towards a hafiz and secondly <br>there is a tradition in Musnad Ahmad- <br>Till he reads of whatever Qur'an is with him. <br>This word more clearly refers to a hafiz, although a <br>reader who remains very often engaged in reciting the <br>Qur'an inay also be implied. <br>It is written in ' ~ i 6 a a t '  <br>that this hadith does not apply <br>to a reader who is accursed by the Qur'an. This is with re- <br>ference to the hadith that there are many readers of the <br>Qur'an who read the Qur'an but the Qur'an invokes curses <br>upon them. Therefore, the reading of Qur'an by a person <br>who does not adhere to the correct tenets does not consti- <br>tutc ar! argument that he is acceptable to Allah. Many Aha- <br>dith of this type relate to the Khawarij (a sect who were <br>opposed to Hadhrat 'Ali (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>In this conimentary, Shah Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) has written that 'tarteel' literally means reading with <br>good and clear pronunciation, while according to Islamic <br>pri~ciplesit means reading in accordance with certain <br>rdes as follows: <br>i <br>I <br>I <br>I <br><br>Part I (Hadith 9) \t<br>(1) \t The letters of the alphabets should be correctly ut- <br>tered to ensure their correct pronunciation so that <br>(b)' is not read as ' (b) ' and ' (Lb)' and so on. <br>(2) \t Stopping correctly at the pauses, so that the join- <br>2 5<br>ing or finishing of the verses may not take place at 5 .:<br>inappropriate places. <br>m& <br>(3) The correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. <br>gg<br>3 h <br>(4) \t Raising the voice slightly so that the words of <br>Qur'an uttered by the mouth. may reach the ears <br>and thus influence the heart. <br>(5) \t Setting the sound in a way that it may become full <br>of pathos and may affect the heart quickly, be- <br>cause a pathetic voice influences the heart at once, <br>moves and strengthens the soul more affectively. <br>The physicians are of the opinion that if a medicine is re- <br>quired to affect the heart quickly, it should be given a <br>sweet smell by means of a perfume, for the heart is sensi- <br>tive to sweet smell and if the medicine is required to affect <br>the liver, it should be sweetened with sugar because the <br>liver likes sweet things. Therefore, if a perfume is used at <br>the time of recitation, it will have a better influence on the <br>heart. <br>(6) Tashdeed ( (5) ) (doubling of letters) and madd ( (3) ) <br>(prolongation of letters) should be fully pro-<br>nounced because this reveals the grandeur of the <br>Qur'an and adds to its effectiveness. <br>(7) \t As stated earlier, the reader's heart should respond <br>to the ayat indicating mercy of Allah or chastise- <br>ment by Him. <br>The aboce-me~~tioned <br>seven rules constitute the cor- <br>rect way of reciting the Qur'an, which is called tarteel, and <br>the sole object of all this is to reach the correct understand- <br>ing and grasp of the deeper meaning of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Hadhrat Umm-e-Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) was <br>once askecl by someone as to how Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>aleihe wasallam) used to recite Qur'an. She said, \"In a way <br>that all vowel sounds were clear and the pronunciation of <br>each letter was distinct.\" It is desirable to recite the Qur'an <br>with propriety even if one may not understand the mean- <br>ing. Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that he preferred <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>to recite with propriety, short surahs like Al-Qaari'ah ( (kpk) <br>or Izaa zulzilah (+)j \\i!))rather than to recite (otherwise <br>long) surahs like Aal-e-Imran ((dl& ~i,)<br>without it. <br>The commentators and learned scholars explain the <br>above-mentioned hadith to mean that, for each ayat recited. <br>the reciter will be elevated to a higher level in Paradise. <br>From other ahadith, it appears that there are as many levels <br>in Paradise as the number of ayaat in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Therefore, the status of a persori will be raised by as many <br>levels in Paradise as the number of ayaat in which he is <br>well versed. As such, the one best versed in the whole <br>Qur'an will reach the highest level in Paradise. <br>According to Mulla 'Ali Qari, it is mentioned in a <br>hadith that there is no level in Jannat higher than that <br>given to the reader of the Qur'an. So the readers will <br>ascend in proportion to the number of ayaat recited by <br>them in the world. 'Allamah Daani (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>says that authorities agree that there are six thousand ayaat <br>in the Qur'an. But there is some difference of opinion about <br>the numbers over and above six thousand. These are vari- <br>ously reported'to be 204,14,19,25,36. <br>It is written in 'Sharhul-Ihya' that each ayat corre-<br>sponds to a higher level in Paradise. So a reader will be <br>asked to ascend according to his recitation. One who reads <br>the whole of the Qur'an will attain the highest level in Par- <br>adise. And one who knows only a part of the Qur'an will <br>rise up to the proportionate level. In brief, the stage or level <br>reached will be fixed by the number of ayaat recited. <br>According to my understanding, the above hadith has <br>a different meaning- <br>(If my interpretation is corect, it is from Allah and, if it <br>is wrong, it is from me and from Satan, and Allah and <br>His Prophet are free from it.) <br>I think that the elevation implied in this hadith is not <br>that which can be determined by the number of ayat to be <br>recited. i.e., when one ayat be recited, the status will be <br>raised by one step, whether it be read with propriety or <br><br>Part I (Hadith 10) <br>without. But this hadith points to another kind of elevation <br>which is a type of an inner experience and is related to the <br>recitation being with proprietv or without it. So a person <br>will be able to read in the same way as he reads in this <br>= <br>worldly life. Mullah 'Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>quoted from one hadith that, if a person reads the Qur'an <br>very often in this life, he will remember it in the life Here- ;g <br>after, otherwise he will forget it. May Allah help us there. <br>.gg<br>h x<br>There are many among us who memorized the Qur'an in <br>their childhood through the religious zeal of their parents, <br>bu! through sheer carelessness and negligence on their own <br>part, have forgotten this capability in the later part of this <br>very life. It is mentioned in other ahadith that one who dies <br>while labouring and working hard to commit the Glorious <br>Qur'an to memory, will be reckoned amongst the huffaaz. <br>Allah's bounty has no limits. We should only seek it. As a <br>poet says: <br>0' Shaheedi! His bounties are common for all, You <br>could not be denied [these bounties), if you were all <br>worthy. <br>HADITH 10 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>Rasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever reads one letter of the Rook of Allah is credited <br>with one blessing and one blessing is equal to~~enfold <br>the like thereof in its reward. 1 do not say that @Jl(Alif <br>Laam Meem) is one letter, but ' (9' (alif) is one letter, ' (J, <br>'(laam) is one letter, and '(r)' (meem) is one letter.\" <br>The hadith affirms that whereas, ordinarily for the pur- <br>pose of reward an act as a whole is taken into account but <br>in the case of Qur'an it is not so, parts also count. Thus, in <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>reading each letter is counted as one good deed. And the <br>reward of each good deed will be increased ten times, as <br>promised by Almighty Allah. <br>I <br>\"One who brings a good deed, for him will be tenfold <br>the like thereof.\" <br>'Ten times, however, is the minimum increase. <br>Allah multiplies the reward for whomsoever He de- <br>sires. <br>That each letter of the Holy Qur'an, when read, <br>amot~ntsto a good deed, has been illustrated by Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) by saying that '91'(Alif Laam <br>Meem) is not one letter, but ' (9' (alif). '(J)'(laam) and '(9' <br>(meem) are three separate letters, so it will comprise thirty <br>blessings. There is a differeilce of opinion anlong scholars <br>whether 'dl'(alif, laam, meem) is the beginning of Surah <br>Baqarah or of Surah Feel. If it is the beginning of Surah Ba- <br>qarah, and only three letters are counted, as they are writ- <br>ten, then the blessings wi!l be thirty. And if it is the <br>beginning of Surah Feel, then ' ( I ) '  (alif),'(3)'(laam) and '(f)' <br>(meem). which is the beginning of Surah Eaqarah will be <br>nine letters. Therefore, its reward will be ninety blessings. <br>Baihaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported another <br>hadith similar to this portion of the above-mentioned <br>hadith, viz.. \"I do nolt say that '(Ale)' <br>(Bismillah) is one <br>letter, but uphold that '(d)' (ha) '(,.I)' <br>(sin) and '(9'(meem), <br>etc, are separate letters.\" <br>HADITH- 11 <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz Juhani (Radhiyallaho anho) reports <br>that Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. <br>Part I (Hadith 11) <br>\"Whoever reads the Qur'an and acts upon what is con- <br>tained in it, his parents will be made to wear a crown <br>on the Day of Judgement, the brilliance of which will <br>excel that of the sun, if the same were within your <br>wordly houses. So, what do you think about the person <br>4 I ,<br>Zi,<br>who himself acts upon it?\" <br>Thus, it is through the virtues of his reading the Qur'an <br>.-<br>W<br>W<br> <br>+<br>and acting upon it that the parents of the leader will be <br>a-x <br>honoured with a crown, the brilliance of which will far <br>excel the light of the sun even if the sun were within one's <br>own house. The sun is at a great distance from us and even <br>then its light is so bright. If the sun comes down into one's <br>house, its light and brilliance will surely increase mani- <br>fold. The light of the crown to be worn by the parents of <br>the reader will be still more brilliant. When this is in $tore <br>for the parents, what will be the reward of the reader him- <br>self? Surely if the beneficiaries get so much, the reward of <br>the person who is the real cause should be much more. The <br>parents get this reward solely because they were the cause <br>of the reader coming into being, or were responsible for his <br>education. <br>In addition to the fact that the light of the sun will he <br>far greater if it were in one's own house, this simile implies <br>yet another delicate point. Attachment and liking for a <br>thing increase when it always remains with a person. <br>Therefore, the feeling of strangeness for the sun due to dis- <br>tance will give place to attachment, because of its close <br>nearness all the time. Thus, in addition to describing the <br>brilliance of the crown, the hadith implies this attachment <br>with the crown and also the great satisfaction that it be- <br>longs to oneself. Everybody gets benefited by the sun, but if <br>it were to be given entirely to a person, how very proud he <br>would feel. <br>Haakim (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported from Burai- <br>dah, (Radhiyallaho anho) saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam); \"One who recites the Qur'an and acts <br>upon it will be made to wear a crown woven with noor, <br>and his parents will be made to wear garments, which will <br>be more valuable than the entire world. They will say, <br>'Almighty Allah! what is it that we are being given these <br>garments for?' 'In lieu of the reading of Qur'an by your <br>child', will be the reply.\" <br>It is given in Jam'ul Fawaa'id by Tabrani (Rahmatullah <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>alaih) that Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) had reported <br>the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Whoever teaches the reading of Qur'an to his son (without <br>memorizing it), all his sins, whether previous or subse-<br>quent, will be forgiven; and whoever makes his child mem- <br>orize the Qur'an will be raised on the Day of Judgement in <br>the semblance of a full moon; and his son will be asked to <br>start reciting, and for every ayat read by the child, the <br>status of the parent will be raised to the next higher grade <br>of jannat, till the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is com- <br>pleted.\" <br>Such are the blessings for teaching the Qur'an to your <br>children. This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on <br>iour shoulders a very heavy accountability. The hadith <br>that-<br>Each one of you is a guardian, and will be questioned <br>about those under his control <br>means that everyone s,hall be questioned about his subordi- <br>nates and dependents as to what extent he taught (deen) to <br>them. Surely one should guard himself and his dependents <br>against these shortcomings. But (as the proverb goes) <br>\"should one discard clothes for fear of lice?\" Nav, one <br>should surely try to keep his clothes clean. If you impart <br>religious education to your child, you will be free from <br>vour responsibilities. As long as the child lives, and what- <br>ever good deed he does and salad he performs and forgive- <br>ness that he seeks from Allah for you, will elevate your <br>position in Paradise. If for the sake of this life and for the <br>lust of a few coppers, you keep him ignorant of (deen), not <br>only wiil you have to suffer for this misdeed but whatever <br>evil and misdeeds he does. your account will not be free <br>from their burden. For God's sake, have pity on yourselves. <br>This life is only a passing phase and death will put an end <br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica- <br>tion of the hadith is general arid not confined to any par- <br>ticular period. It means that if any hafiz of Qur'an were cast <br>in due to any crime on his part, the fire of Hell will not <br>affect him. In another hadith it is said that the fire will not <br>even touch him. The second interpretation of the above- <br>mentioned hadith is also supported by another hadith re- <br>ported by Abu Umaamah (Radhiyallaho anho) and also <br>given in the book Sharhus Sunnah, by Mulla Ali Qari, <br>which says, \"Learn the Qur'an by heart, because Almighty <br>Allah does not punish the heart which contains the <br>Qur'an .\" In its meanings this hadith is clear and confirmed <br>by the Qur'an. Those who regard memorizing the Qur'an as <br>useless should, for God's sake, ponder over these merits. <br>The last-mentioned one alone should prompt everybody to <br>dedicate his life to learning the Qur'an by heart, because <br>there is no one who has not committed sins and does not <br>deserve the fire of Hell. <br>In Sharhul Ihya there is a list of those people who wiil <br>rest in the shade of Allah's mercy (protection) on the hor- <br>rible Day of Judgement. It is mentioned therein that. <br>according to a hadith reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) by Dailami that the custodians of Qur'an, in <br>other words those who learn the Qur'an by heart, will be in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell.\" <br>By the grace of Allah, entry into Jannat is ensured for <br>every believer though it may come after his being punished <br>for his misdeeds. The hafiz will, however, be favoured with <br>this entry right from the beginning. The ten persons in <br>whose favour his intercession will be accepted will be <br>those sinful and disobedient Muslims who are guilty of <br>major sins. There can be no intercession, however, for the <br>unbelievers. Almighty Allah has said: <br>Whosoever ascribes partners unto Allah, for him Allah <br>has forbidden Jannat, and their place is Hell - and for <br>evil-doers there will be none amongst the helpers. <br>It is also said in the Qur'an: <br>The Prophet and the believers are not allowed to pray <br>for the forgiveness of 'mushrikin' (Plural of mushrik, <br>one who ascribes partners unto Allah) the polytheists <br>even if they are their relatives. <br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Learn the Qur'an and recite it, because the example of <br>one who learns the Qur'an, reads it and recites it in Ta- <br>hajjud (salaat late after midnight) is like an open bag <br>full of musk, the fragrance whereof spreads over the <br>entire place, and a person who has learnt the Qur'an <br>but sleeps while the Qur'an is in his heart, is like a bag <br>full of musk but with its mouth closed.\" <br>It means that the example of one who learns the Quran and <br>cares for it and recites it in Tahajjud salaat is like that of a <br>musk-container which, if opened, fills the whole house <br>with its sweet smell. In the same way, the entire house is <br>lit up with divine light and blessings due to the recitation <br>by the hafiz. Even if the hafiz remains asleep or does not <br>recite through his negligence, the Qur'an in his heart is in <br>any case the musk. This negligence resulted in the loss that <br>others were deprived of the blessings of Qur'an, but his <br>heart does, in any case, contain the musk of Qur'an. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In <br>the house where the Qur'an is read, the household mem- <br>bers increase, virtues and blessings multiply, angels de- <br>scend upon them and Satan quits the house. Whereas the <br>house in which Qur'an is not recited, life therein becomes <br>straitened and devoid of blessings, angels leave the house <br>and Satan ravages it.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) and some <br>others have reported Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to have said thdt a deserted house is one in which the <br>Holy Qur'an is not recited. <br>HADITH- 16 <br>*.<br>iwl dig\\ii13<br>~d & 2\\ @ <br>&j @G 2 (1,) <br>, , <br>o f  <br>@j <br>@&j\\ 23 @ .I$\\ ikIj,!*,23 +Tg\\!;\\,j> p\\ <br>I <br>0 ,  <br>I. d ,  <br>e>\\ <br>2 ,J&1 u&J\\, &j\\ 2 &i +I, <br>&\\,@\\ <br>,* C*, <br>8 . 5  <br>cJ dl <br>,y e fCpj <br>Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says that Rasu- <br>lpllah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Recitation of <br><br>2.3 <br>Part I (Hadith 17) <br>the Qur'an in salaat is more rewarding than the recita- <br>tion outside salaat; recitation outside salaat is prefer- <br>able to tasbeeh and takbeer (repeating words of Praise <br>for Allah); tasbeeh is superior to sadaqah (alms); sada- <br>= <br>qah to sowm (fasting) and sowm is protection against <br>Fire.\" <br>o L <br>The superiority of recitation of the Qur'an over zikr $? <br>(glorification and remembrance of Allah) is evident be- 5~ <br>cause Qur'an is the Word oi Allah. As mentioned earlier, <br>the superiority of the Word of Allah over the speech of <br>others is like His superiority over His creation. The superi- <br>ority of zikr over sadaqah has been stressed in other aha- <br>dith as well. But the superiority of sadaqah over sowm as <br>given in this hadith, seems contrary to that given in some <br>other ahadith where sowm is said to be better than sada- <br>qah.' This difference is due to the variations in the type of <br>people and their conditions of life. <br>According to this hadith sowm comes last in the order <br>of merit. When sowm is protection against the Fire of Hell, <br>we can imagine numerous blessing of the recitation of <br>Qur 'an. <br>The author of 'Ihya' reports on the authority of Hadh- <br>rat' Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that for every letter recited <br>there are hundred blessings for one who reads the Qur'an <br>while standing in salaat, fifty blessings for one who reads <br>while sitting in salaat, twenty-five blessings for one who <br>reads in the state of wudhu outside salaat, ten blessings for <br>one who reads without wudhu, and one blessing for him <br>who does not read himself but listens eagerly to the reader. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) savs: \"Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked us. 'Does <br>any one of you like that when he returns homc, ht? <br>should find three she-camels, pregnant and fat.' We <br>said, 'We would love to do so.' Then Rasulullah (Sal-<br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Three ayaat which one <br>of you may recite in his salaat are better than three big <br>pregnant and fat she-camels.\" <br>A similar subject-matter has been described in hadith <br>3. In this hadith there is a reference to recitation of the <br>Qur'an inside salaat which is more virtuous than recitation <br>outside salaat. That is why a comparison has been made to <br>pregnant she-camels. Because, just as in one case, there is a <br>reference to two virtues, that is salaat and recitation, in the <br>other case there is a reference to two things that is a she- <br>camel and her pregnancy. It has been mentioned under <br>hadith 3 that ahadith of this kind are only for the purpose <br>of a simile, otherwise the everlasting reward of one ayat is <br>more valuable than thousands of mortal she-camels. <br>HADITH- 18 <br>Hazrat Uthman bin Abdullah bin Aus Thaqafi (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anhum) narrates from his grand-father that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Reciting <br>the Qur'an from memory carries one thousand degrees <br>of spiritual reward, while reading the Qur'an from the <br>i <br>Book increases it,up to two thousand degrees.\" <br>Many virtues of being a hafiz have been mentioned <br>before. In this hadith, however, preference is shown to <br>reading from the Holy Book as compared to reciting it from <br>memory, because reading from the Book is not only condu- <br>cive to deeper understanding and meditation but also in- <br>cludes several other devotional acts, such as looking into <br>I <br>the Qur'an and touching it, etc. The difference in the ap- <br>parent meanings of the various ahadith has led to a differ- <br>ence of opinion among the scholars of hadith as to whether <br>reading from the Holy Book is better than reciting it from <br>memory. By reason of the above hadith, and because <br>reading from the Book safeguards against making mistakes <br>and includes the virtuous act of looking at the Holy Book, <br>some scholars give preference to reading by looking into <br><br>Part I (Hadith 19) <br>the Book. By reason of other ahadith, and because reciting <br>from memory is conducive to greater devotion and is free <br>from riyaa' (dissimulation) and because this was the way of <br>recitation of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self, some scholars consider that reciting from memory is $-3<br>preferable. Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) has decided <br>0 2 <br>that the preference between the two depends upon the in- <br>dividuals. Some people concentrate and meditate better <br>Z Q<br>T x<br>while reading from the Book, while others do so, reciting <br>from memory. Therefore, reading from the Book is prefer- <br>able for some and reciting from memory for others. Hafiz <br>Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah alaih) also has favoured this inter- <br>pretation in his book 'Fat-hul Baari.' <br>It is said that on account of excessive reading by Hadh- <br>rat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) two scripts of the Holy <br>Qur'an tore. Amr ibn Maimoon (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>mentioned in 'Sharhul Ihya', that one who opens the Holy <br>Qur'an after Fajr (dawn) salaat and reads a hundred ayaat <br>gets a reward as large as the entire world. Reading the <br>Qur'an by looking into it is reported to be beneficial for <br>eyesight. Hadhrat Abu Ubaidah (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated a lengthy hadith in which each reporter says that <br>he had some trouble with his eyes and that his teacher <br>bade him to recite the Qur'an by looking into it. Hadhrat <br>Imaam Shaafi'ee, (Rahmatullah alaih) often used to open <br>the Qur'an after Ishaa (night) salaat and close it only a little <br>before Fajr salaat.' <br>HADITH- 19 <br>Abdullah ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anhuma) narrated: <br>\"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The <br>hearts get rusted as does iron with water. When some- <br>one asked, \"What could cleanse he~rts again?' Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Frequent <br>remembrance of death and recitation of Qur'an.\" <br>Excess of sins and negligence in the remembrance of <br>Allah cause the hearts to rust, as water causes iron to rust. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>The reading of Qur'an and the remembrance of death <br>polish the rusted hearts. The heart is like a mirror. If it is <br>not cleaned, it will not properly reflect the recognition of <br>Allah. The more burnished and brighter it is, the better will <br>it show from the enlightenment. Therefore, the more we in- <br>dulge in sinful lust and devilish acts, the more are we de- <br>prived of the recognition of Almighty Allah. It is with a <br>view to polishing the mirror of the heart that mashaa'ikh <br>enjoin upon their disciples to devote themselves to self-dis- <br>cipline endeavours, spiritual occupation, incantation and <br>remembrance of Allah. <br>It is mentioned in some ahadith that when a man com- <br>mits a sin, a black dot stains his heart. If he repents in real <br>earnest, this dot is removed, but if he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears. In this way, if he goes on com- <br>mitting sin after sin, his heart gets completely blackened. <br>At this stage the heart becomes quite disinclined to do <br>good!, and keeps on turning to evil. <br>May Allah save us from such a stage. <br>\"Verily their evil deeds have covered their hearts with <br>rust\" refers to this blackening of the heart. <br>According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) said, \"I leave two 'wu'aaz' (plural of <br>waa'iz-preacher)-one <br>speaking and the other silent. That <br>which speaks is the Holy Qur'an and that which is silent is <br>the remembrance of death.\" <br>Certainly the words of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) are worthy of loving acceptance. But only those <br>who take proper heed derive benefit from a sermon. On the <br>other hand, if we consider deen itself as being a useless oc- <br>cupation and an obstacle in the way of material progress, <br>we will neither feel the need of spiritual advice nor act <br>upon it. <br>Hadhrat I-Iasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"People <br>.of earlier times believed the Holy Qur'an to be the Com- <br>mandment of Allah, they contemplated over it throughout <br>the night and acted upon it during the day. Whereas today <br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 20) <br>you exercise particular care to pronounce its words and <br>vowels correctly, but do not take it as the Commandment of <br>Allah, and do not contemplate over it.\" <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Certainly <br>there is always a thing in which people take pride. <br>And that which is glory and pride for my Umlnat is the <br>Holy Qur'an.\" <br>People indicate their nobility and dignity by virtue of <br>their lineage, their familv and other similar things. ?'he <br>Qur'an is the source of nobility and pride for the Ummat in <br>the sense that reading, memorizing and teaching it, as also <br>acting upon it; in short, everything related to it, confers an <br>honour upon them. Why should it not be so? After all, it is <br>the Word of the Beloved and the Commandment of the <br>Master. Its dignity excels all worldly honours, however <br>great. The achievements of this worldly life, however <br>splendid vanish sooner or later, while the splelldour and <br>dignity of the Qur'an is eternal and unbounded. <br>Even the minor attributes of the Glorious Qur'an are <br>such as we should be proud of, let alone its excellence in <br>other respects, for example, its beautiful composition, won- <br>derful coherence, the right choice of words, the proper de- <br>velopment of arguments, the narration of past events and <br>prophecies about the future. Its assailing remarks concern- <br>ing other people are such as cannot be contradicted, e.g., <br>the remark about the Jews, that they profess their love for <br>Allah, but they never long for death. The listener is im- <br>pressed by its recitation and the reader never gets tired of <br>reading it. It is usual that, however lovely a discorirse may <br>be, it may even be a letter from a beloved who has made <br>one mad: we will become tireti of reading it for the twen- <br>tieth time if not the tenth: or the fortieth time, if not the <br>twentieth. On the other hand, if we just memorize one sec- <br>tion of the Qur'an, one may read it two hundred times or <br>four hundred times or go on doing so for the whole life. but <br>one shall never lose interest. And if something prevents us <br>from enjoying it, that will be for a while only. In fact, the <br>more we read the Qur'an, the greater will be our enjoyment <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>and satisfaction. Even if a few of the above excellent quali- <br>ties were to be found in any composition, we would be all <br>praise for it. So, if all these qualities were present in a com- <br>position to a perfect degree, surely it would have to be re- <br>garded with the greatest honour and pride. <br>Now, we should just reflect on our own condition. <br>How many of us feel really proud of having memorized the <br>whole Qur'an? Does a hafiz command real respect in our <br>eyes? Alas! our honour and pride lie in high university de- <br>grees, in big titles, in worldly pomp and show, and in the <br>wealth which we will have to leave behind us on our <br>death. 0,Allah! have mercy up011 us. <br>HADITH- 21 <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he re- <br>quested Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give <br>him some lasting advice. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Cultivate the fear and reverence of <br>Allah in your heart, because this is the root of all virtu- <br>ous deeds.\" I asked him to add something more and he <br>said, \"Stick to the reading of the Qur'an, because it is a <br>noor in this life and a provision for the Hereafter.\" <br>The fear of Allah is the root of all good actions. A man <br>whose heart is filled with fear of Allah, does neither <br>commit any sin nor experience any difficulty. <br>Whoever fears Allah, Allah will make a way for him <br>out of every difficulty and provide from whence he has <br>no expectation. <br>Some of the foregoing traditions also disclose that the <br>Qur'an is illuminating. In Sharahul Ihya, Hadhrat Abu <br>Na'eem (Rahmatullah alaih] states that Hadhrat Baasit <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) has reported from Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) that the houses in which the Holy <br><br>Part I (Hadith 21) <br>Qur'an is read shine unto the inhabitants of the Heaven as <br>do the stars shine unto the inhabitants of the Earth. <br>This hadith, which has been quoted from 'At-Targhib', <br>is only a part of a long hadith reported from Ibn Hibban by <br>Mulla Ali Qari in detail and by Suyuti in brief. Although :<br>P <br>the above-mentioned part of the hadith is sufficient for the <br>purpose of this book. yet the whole hadith includes many <br>essential and useful subjects and, therefore, its subject- - . P<br>matter is given in the following paragraphs. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anha) says that he in- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallamj about <br>the number of books revealed by Almighty Allah. Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"One hundred <br>booklets and four books. Fifty booklets were revealed to <br>Hadhrat Sheeth (Alaihis salaam) (peace be upon him), <br>thirty to Hadhrat Idrees (Alaihis salaam), ten to Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam) and ten to Hadhrat Musa (Alaihis <br>salaam) before the Torah. In addition. four books, i.e., the <br>Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Holy Qur'an have <br>been revealed by Almighty Allah.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) enquired about the contents of the booklets <br>revealed to Hadhrat Ibrahim (Alaihis salaam). Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied that they consisted of <br>proverbs, e.g., \"0,you strong and proud king! I did not ap- <br>point you to hoard wealth, but to prevent the complaint of <br>the oppressed from reaching me by redressing it before- <br>hand, because I do not reject the complaint of the op- <br>pressed person, even though he may be a disbeliever.\" <br>The author states that whenever Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) deputed any of his Companions as an <br>ameer or governor, in addition to giving other advice, he <br>used to emphasize: <br>Beware of the invocation of the oppressed because be- <br>tween him and Allah there is no veil or intermediary. <br>As a Persian verse goes: <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>\"Beware of the sigh of those oppressed, when they <br>Pray 9 <br>Divine acceptance readily greets them. <br>These booklets also mentioned that it is incumbent on <br>a wise man, unless he is deprived of sanity, to divide his <br>time in three parts: one for worship of his Lord; one for <br>self-reckoning to consider what acts, good or bad, he did <br>and one for his lawful earning of livelihood. It is also in- <br>cumbent upon him to watch of his time and be thoughtful <br>about improving his conditions and to guard his tongue <br>against unnecessary and useless talk. Whoever keeps a <br>check on his own speech, his tongue will indulge less in <br>useless talk. <br>Also, a wise man should not travel except for three <br>purposes. viz., for making provision for the life Hereafter, <br>or in search of livelihood, or for such recreation as is per- <br>missible. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) then enquired <br>about the contents of the booklets revealed to Hadhrat <br>Musa (Alaihis salaam). Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said, \"They contained monitions only, such as 'I am <br>astonished by one who finds pleasures in anything in spite <br>of his faith in the certainty of death.' (Naturally when a <br>person becomes sure of his sentence of hanging, and <br>mounting the gallows, he can never find pleasure in any- <br>thing). 'I am astonished by one who laughs in spite of his <br>faith in certainty of death'. 'I arn astonished by one who ob- <br>serves accidents, changes and revolutions of the world all <br>the time, and still finds satisfaction in it.' 'I am astonished <br>by one who believes in predestination, still suffers from <br>grief and hardship.' 'I am astonished by one who believes <br>that he will soon be required to render an account and still <br>does no good deed.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) goes on saying <br>that he asked for more advice. Rasulullah (Sallailaho alaihe <br>wasallam) advised that he should cultivate fear of Allah, <br>because it is the root and basis of all spiritual actions. <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Kadhivdllaho anho) then begged for more <br>advice. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallaln) said, \"Be <br>consistent in recitation of Qur'an and remembrance of <br>Allah, because it is a noor in this world and a provision in <br>Heaven.\" Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhivallaho anho) again <br>sought further advice and was told. \"Abstain from too <br><br>Part I (Hadith 22) <br>much of laughter, because it causes the heart to wither, and <br>the face loses its lustre.\" (Too much of laughter is injurious <br>both for the outward and inward disposition of man.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) sought further <br>S <br>advice, whereupon Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) -: <br>said, \"Stick to jihaad because this is the rahbaaniyyat of my <br>g 6 <br>ummat.\" (Rahbaan - singular raahib - were those people of <br>.!> x<br>previous ~ ~ ~ n m a t s  <br>who severed all their worldly connec-<br>tions and turned towards Allah.) <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) asked for more <br>advice and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Associate yourself with the poor and the needy, be <br>friendly with them and sit in their company.\" When Hadh- <br>rat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) requested further advice, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Look to-<br>wards those who rank below you (so that you may get used <br>to being thankful) and do not look at those who rank above <br>you, lest you should despise the favours of Allah upon <br>you.\" <br>When Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) again <br>asked for more advice, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) said, \"Let your own faults prevent you from criticiz- <br>ing others and do not try to find fault with others, because <br>you commit those faults yourself. It is enough to prove you <br>guilty that you should find in others such faults as you <br>yourself possess, though you may not be aware of them, <br>and that you should find in others such misdeeds as you <br>yourself commit.\" After this, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) patted the chest of Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>with his loving hand and said, \"0,Abu Zar! there is no <br>wisdom better than prudence, nor any piety better than re- <br>fraining from the unlawful, nor any nobility better than <br>polite manners.\" <br>(In stating the contents of this long hadith, the gist and <br>meaning has been kept in view, in preference to the literal <br>translation.) <br>HADITH- 22 <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Never do a people collect in one of the houses of <br>I <br>Allah (mosque) reciting the Qur'an and reading it out <br>to one another, but sakeenah (tranquillity) descends <br>upon them, rahmat (mercy) enshrouds them, the angels <br>throng around them and Almighty Allah mentions <br>them, in the assembly of angels.\" <br>!<br>This hadith describes the special virtues of religious <br>schools and institutions. Acquisition of either reward men- <br>tioned above is so sublime that even if one devotes his <br>whole life to acquire it, it will be worth while. But here <br>there are so many rewards, especially the last one. Mention <br>in the Court of Almighty Allah and remembrance in the <br>company of the beloved are bounties that can hardly be <br>surpassed. <br>Descending of sakeenah has been mentioned in many <br>ahadith. The scholars of ahadith have interpreted its real <br>significance in many ways. The various interpretations, <br>however, do not contradict each other and can be meaning- <br>fully put together. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) has interpreted sakee- <br>nah as a special breeze, which has a face like that of a <br>human being. <br>Allamah Suddi (Rahmatullah alaih) is reported to have <br>said that it is the name of a large golden dish in Paradise <br>used for washing the hearts of the Prophets (Alaihimus <br>salam) (peace be upo? them). <br>Some have said that it is a special form of mercy. <br>Tabari (Rahmatullah alaih) prefers the view that it <br>means peace of heart. Some interpret it as grace, others <br>consider it as dignity, and some take it to mean angels. <br>There are other views as well. Hafiz has written in 'Fat-hul <br>Baari' that sakeena includes all the above mentioned bles- <br>sings. In the opinion of Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih), it is a <br>combination of tranquility, mercy, etc., and descends along <br>with the angels. It is mentioned in the Qur'an as follows: <br>Then Allah caused His sakeenah to descend upon him. <br><br>It is He Who sent down sakeenah into the hearts of the <br>believers (XLVIII: 4). <br>Wherein is sakeenah from your Lord (I1 :248). <br>Thus this happy blessing is mentioned in several ayaat <br>of the Qur'an, and there are many ahadith containing tid- <br>ings of this. <br>It is narrated in 'Ihya' that once Ibn Thauban (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho) had promised one of his relatives thqt he <br>would break his fast with him, but reached the house of his <br>relative next morning. When the host complained about the <br>guest being so late, the guest said, \"But fon the promise that <br>I owe you, I would never disclose what prevented me from <br>coming to you. I just got late by chance until it was time of <br>Ishaa salaat. I thought I should complete my Witr (compul- <br>sory salaat of three raka'at following Isha) as well, lest I <br>should die during the night without offering this salaat, be- <br>cause there can be no surety against death. While I was re- <br>citing qunoot (a special invocation in Witr salaat), I saw a <br>green garden of Paradise, which had all sorts of flowers. I <br>was so absorbed in the vision that it was dawn.\" There <br>have been hundreds of similar incidents in the lives of our <br>righteous ancestors. Such things are, however, experienced <br>only when there is complete separation from everyone be- <br>sides Allah, and perfect attention towards Him. <br>Similarly there are many ahadith mentioning en-<br>shrouding by the angels. A detailed story about Usaid ibn <br>Hudhair (Radhiyallaho anho) is given in the books of <br>Hadith. It is said that while he was reciting the Holy <br>Qur'an, he felt a sort of cloud spread over himself. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) informed him that <br>these were angels who had gathered to listen to the recita- <br>tion of the Qur'an. Due to their great throng they appeared <br>like a cloud. <br>Once a Sahabi felt a sort of cloud over himself. Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) told him that it was sa- <br>keenah, which was sent down by reason of the recitation of <br>the Qur'an. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>In Muslim Sharif, this hadith is given in greater detal~. <br>The concluding sentence is- <br>One whose evil deeds drive him away from the mercy <br>of Allah, the superiority of his lineage or nobility of his <br>family cannot bring him near it. <br>Thus a person who has a continuous noble pedigree, <br>but indulges in disobedience and impiety, cannot be equal <br>in the presence of Allah to a Muslim who is of low birth <br>and abject ir, humility, but otherwise God-fearing and <br>devout. <br>;\\ <br>$$;<br>&<br>&\\<br>$&, <br>Verily the noblest of you in the view of Allah is the <br>one who is most God-fearing. <br>i \t<br>HADITH- 23 <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"You <br>cannot turn to Allah and gain nearness to Him with <br>anything superior to that which directly proceeded <br>from Him, i.e., the Holy Qur'an.\" <br>It is evident from numerous ahadith that there is no <br>better means of seeking nearness to the presence of Allah <br>than recitation of the Qur'an. Imam Ahnlad ibn Hambal <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) says. \"I saw Almighty Allah in a <br>dream and asked Him what was the best means for seeking <br>nearness to His presence. Allah said, '0,Ahmad! It is My <br>Word (i.e. the Qur'an).' I enquired whether it is only <br>reading while understanding the meaning, or reading with- <br>out understanding. Allah said 'Whether by understanding <br>the meaning or without understanding. it is a means of <br>nearpess either way.\"' <br>I <br>-<br><br>Part 1 (Hadith 23)<br>That the reading of the Qur'an is the best means of get- <br>ting access to Almighty Allah is explained in the commen- <br>tary of Maulana Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi (Nawwarallaho <br>marqadahu), who is an authority for the prosterity. Its sub- <br>stance is that sulook ilallaah (the path of mystics towards <br>Allah) which is also.called the stage of Ihsaan can be at- <br>tained in three ways:- <br>, (1) 'Tasawwur', known as meditation in Sharee'at and <br>muraqabah in the terminology of mystics. <br>(2) Remembrance of \t Allah by repeating words of <br>praise for Him. <br>(3) \t Reading of the Holy Qur'an. <br>Since the first method is remembrance in the heart, so <br>there remain in fact two ways only; first the remembrance <br>by heart or by word of mouth, and secondly recitation of <br>the Qur'an. The essence of zikr is that the word which is <br>used for or refers to Almighty Allah should be repeated <br>over and over again. This repetition helps the mudrakah <br>(the faculty of understanding) in concentrating upon the <br>person of the one being remembered. It would give rise to a <br>feeling of immediate presence of that person. Constancy in <br>this state is called 'ma'iyyat' (togetherness), which is refer- <br>red to in the hadith below: <br>My servant ceases not to seek nearness to Me through<br>nafil (optional) deeds, until I make him My favourite, <br>and thus I become his ears wherewith he hears, his <br>eyes wherewith he sees, and his hands wherewith he <br>holds, and his feet wherewith he walks. <br>It means that when a person, through excessive devo- <br>tion becomes a favourite of Allah, Allah becomes a guard- <br>ian of all the limbs of his body so that his eyes, ears, etc., <br>all submit to His will. This blessing is said to be the result <br>of constancy in nafil salaat, because fard (obligatory) salaat <br>are specified and do not admit of excess, while nearness <br>and close attachment demand constancy and concentra- <br>tion, as mentioned above. <br>But this mode of seeking nearness is exclusive for that <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>P ~ r eand Beloved Being (Allah), and it is impossible to <br>seek nearness to anybody else by remembering his name <br>over and over again. This is because the one whose near- <br>ness is being sought must have two attributes. First, he <br>should be omniscient, so that he comprehends the zikr of <br>all the zaakireen, whether by word of mouth or by heart, ir- <br>respective of language, time and place. Secondly, he <br>should have the power to illumine the understanding and <br>fulfil the yearning of one who remembers, which is known <br>as 'dunuww' (nearness), 'tadalli' (proximity), 'nuzul' (de- <br>scent) and 'qurb' (nearness). Since these two prerequisites <br>are possessed only by Allah, the abovementioned method <br>of seeking nearness is effective only in respect of Him. The <br>following hadith-e-qudsi (a revelation of Allah quoted by <br>Rasulullah Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), points to this fact: <br>Whoever comes near Me by one span, I go near him by <br>an arm's length; whoever comes near Me by one arm's <br>length, I go near him by one 'baah' (stretch of both <br>arms); whoever comes to Me walking, I go towards him <br>running. <br>This similitude is only for illustration. Otherwise, <br>Allah is above walking and running. It only meails that <br>those who remember and seek Him are helped and looked <br>after by Almighty Allah in a measure far in excess of their <br>own inner urge and efforts. This is so, because it behoves <br>His Benevolence. So, the steadfastness of those who re-<br>member Him invokestconstant attention and results in the <br>descent of favours of Almighty Allah, the Glorious. The <br>Qur'an altogether is zikr of Allah, in the sense that no ayat <br>of the Qur'an is devoid of remembrance and attention to- <br>wards Allah, and as such it bears characteristics of zikr as <br>mentioned above. There is, however, another distinction of <br>the Qur'an, which is the cause of increased nearness to <br>Allah. And it is this: that every discourse carries the quali- <br>ties and influencing traits of the speaker. It is obvious that <br>recitation of the poetry of sinful and wicked people has its <br>evil effects, while the verses of righteous people excercise a <br>noble influence. It is for this reason that excessive study of <br>knowledge of logic and philosophy produces pride and <br>conceit, while excessive devotion to the study of hadith <br>leads to humility. Although as languages, both English and <br>Part I (Hadith 24) <br>Persian are equal, they produce varying influences upon <br>the readers due to the divergence in the beliefs and atti- <br>tudes of the various authors. It can be concluded that re- <br>peated recitation of the Qur'an will result in the reader's <br>* =<br>being influenced by the qualities of the Originator of the <br>(a<br>verses and in developing a natural affinity for them. More- <br>over, if a person is devoted to the publications of an author, ;d<br>he naturally starts liking and favouring that person. In the f .$<br>&me way, the reader of the Qur'an is sure to win Allah's * X <br>abundant grace, which in turn promotes nearness to Him. <br>May Allah bless us all with His favours. <br>HADITH- 24 <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"For Allah, <br>from amongst the people, there are some who are those <br>of <br>His household.\" <br>The Sahabah (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum) (may Allah be pleased with them) asked, <br>\"Who are those people?\" He replied \"Men of the <br>Qur'an. They are of the household of Allah, and are his <br>favoured ones.\" <br>\"Men of the Qur'an are those who always remain occu- <br>pied with the Qur'an and have got a special attachment to <br>it. That such people are of the household of Allah and His <br>favourites is evident. It is, therefore, clear from the fore- <br>going that, as long as such people always remain occupied <br>with the Qur'an, special favours of Almighty Allah con-<br>tinue to be conferred upon them. Certainly those who live <br>in constant company do become as one of the household. <br>What a great honour it is to belong to His household, to be <br>reckoned amongst the 'Men of Allah' and to become His <br>favourites, with such little striving and endeavour. What <br>sacrifices of comfort and money are not made by people for <br>admittance to worldly courts or to be elected as members of <br>an assembly. They flatter the voters and bear all sorts of hu- <br>miliations; yet they consider all this worthwhile. But the <br>endeavour for the Qur'an is considered as a waste of time <br>and energy: <br><br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Look at the difference between the paths; what a great <br>divergence! <br>HADITH- 25 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Almighty Allah never gives attention so much to any- <br>thing as He does to the voice of a Prophet reading the <br>Qur'an in a sweet tone.\" <br>It has been mentioned earlier that Almighty Allah de- <br>votes special attention to the recitation of Qur'an, which is <br>His own Word. Since Prophets meticulously observe all the <br>rules of reverence in reading the Qur'an, Allah's listening <br>to them with greater attention is evident. And the sweet- <br>ness of voice itself adds to the embellishment. As for <br>people other than Prophets, their recitaticn attracts Divine <br>attention according to the standard of its excellence. <br>HADITH- 26 <br>Hadhrat Fudhaalah Ibn Ubaid (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallani) <br>said, \"Almighty Allah listens to the voice of the reader <br>of the Qur'an more eagerly than does a master to the <br>song of his singing slave girl.\" <br>! <br>It is natural that singing should attract attention. But <br>religious people do not listen to singing because of the re- <br>striction in Islam. However, Islam does not prohibit listen- <br>ing to the song of a slave woman in one's lawful <br>Part I (Hadith 26) <br>possession, even though, this may attract the fullest atten- <br>tion. <br>It is, however, necessary that the Qur'an shall not be <br>recited in a singing tone, because doing so is forbidden <br>according to several ahadith. In one hadith it is said: <br>Beware of reciting the Qur'an in a musical tone, like <br>that of lovers singing their love poems as musical com- <br>positions. <br>The mashaa'ikh say that one who reads the Glorious <br>Qur'an like a musical song is a faasiq (evil-doer), and even <br>a listener to such recitation commits a sin. It is, however, <br>desirable to recite the Qur'an in a sweet voice without fol- <br>lowing the rules of singing. There are various ahadith con- <br>taining exhortation for reading the Qur'an in a sweet voice. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said at one <br>place, \"Adorn the Qur'an with a good voice.\" In another <br>hadith it is said, \"A sweet voice makes the beauty of the <br>Qur'an twice as beautiful.\" <br>Hadhrat Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) has written in his book 'Ghunyah that once Hadhrat <br>Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) happened to <br>pass a place in the vicinity of Kufa and saw a gathering of <br>evil-doers in a house. A singer named Zaazaan was singing <br>and playing his instrument. On hearing his voice, Ibn <br>Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"What a sweet voice, <br>only if it were used for reciting the Glorious Qur'an,\" and <br>thus saying he covered his head with a piece of cloth and <br>went his way. Zaazaan had seen him saying something. On <br>enquiring from the people, he came to know that Ibn <br>Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) was a Sahabi who had passed <br>saying those words. Zaazaan got very much perturbed by <br>that remark and, to cut the story short, he broke all his mu- <br>sical instruments arid became a follower of Ibn Mas'ood <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and thereafter rose to the position of a <br>distinguished scholar of his time. <br>There are various ahadith that commend reading of the <br>Holy Qur'an in a good voice and at the same time prohibit <br>reading it in a voice resembling singing, as has been stated <br>before.</p></div>"

This is not all. There is another point. God forbid. <br>if you deprive your child of the knowledge of (deen) (relig- <br>ion) for the sake of a few coppers, not only shall you be de- <br>prived of eternal reward but you shall be held answerable <br>before Allah. Is it not a fact that you are depriving your <br>dear child of reading the Qur'an for fear that mullahs and <br>huffaaz, after memorizing the Qur'an become dependent on <br>others for their living? Please remember that not only do <br>vou expose your children to eternal misery, but carry on <br>iour shoulders a very heavy accountability. The hadith <br>that-<br>Each one of you is a guardian, and will be questioned <br>about those under his control <br>means that everyone s,hall be questioned about his subordi- <br>nates and dependents as to what extent he taught (deen) to <br>them. Surely one should guard himself and his dependents <br>against these shortcomings. But (as the proverb goes) <br>\"should one discard clothes for fear of lice?\" Nav, one <br>should surely try to keep his clothes clean. If you impart <br>religious education to your child, you will be free from <br>vour responsibilities. As long as the child lives, and what- <br>ever good deed he does and salad he performs and forgive- <br>ness that he seeks from Allah for you, will elevate your <br>position in Paradise. If for the sake of this life and for the <br>lust of a few coppers, you keep him ignorant of (deen), not <br>only wiil you have to suffer for this misdeed but whatever <br>evil and misdeeds he does. your account will not be free <br>from their burden. For God's sake, have pity on yourselves. <br>This life is only a passing phase and death will put an end <br><br>Pa? 1 (Hadith 12) <br>to a!l its hardships, however great, but the sufferings for <br>which there is no end, will be everlasting. <br>HADITH NO- 12 <br>a c <br>'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"If the <br>Qur'an is placed in a skin and then put in the fire, it <br>will not get burnt.\" <br>The scholars of hadith have interpreted this hadith in <br>two ways. Some of them take the words 'skin' and 'fire' in <br>the literal sense. In this case the hadith refers to a miracle <br>which was particular in the lifetime of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) in the same way as the miracles of <br>other prophets were specific to their lifetime. In the second <br>case, the word 'skin' is interpreted to mean the human skin <br>and the word 'fire' means the fire of Hell. Thus the applica- <br>tion of the hadith is general arid not confined to any par- <br>ticular period. It means that if any hafiz of Qur'an were cast <br>in due to any crime on his part, the fire of Hell will not <br>affect him. In another hadith it is said that the fire will not <br>even touch him. The second interpretation of the above- <br>mentioned hadith is also supported by another hadith re- <br>ported by Abu Umaamah (Radhiyallaho anho) and also <br>given in the book Sharhus Sunnah, by Mulla Ali Qari, <br>which says, \"Learn the Qur'an by heart, because Almighty <br>Allah does not punish the heart which contains the <br>Qur'an .\" In its meanings this hadith is clear and confirmed <br>by the Qur'an. Those who regard memorizing the Qur'an as <br>useless should, for God's sake, ponder over these merits. <br>The last-mentioned one alone should prompt everybody to <br>dedicate his life to learning the Qur'an by heart, because <br>there is no one who has not committed sins and does not <br>deserve the fire of Hell. <br>In Sharhul Ihya there is a list of those people who wiil <br>rest in the shade of Allah's mercy (protection) on the hor- <br>rible Day of Judgement. It is mentioned therein that. <br>according to a hadith reported from Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) by Dailami that the custodians of Qur'an, in <br>other words those who learn the Qur'an by heart, will be in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the shade of Allah, in the company of the Prophets and <br>other virtuous people. <br>HADITH- 13 <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) says that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>Qur'an and learns it by heart, and regards what it <br>makes lawful as lawful and its unlawful as forbidden, <br>will be admitted into Jannat by the Almighty Allah <br>who will also accept his intercession in respect of ten <br>such persons of his family who shall have been <br>doomed to Hell.\" <br>By the grace of Allah, entry into Jannat is ensured for <br>every believer though it may come after his being punished <br>for his misdeeds. The hafiz will, however, be favoured with <br>this entry right from the beginning. The ten persons in <br>whose favour his intercession will be accepted will be <br>those sinful and disobedient Muslims who are guilty of <br>major sins. There can be no intercession, however, for the <br>unbelievers. Almighty Allah has said: <br>Whosoever ascribes partners unto Allah, for him Allah <br>has forbidden Jannat, and their place is Hell - and for <br>evil-doers there will be none amongst the helpers. <br>It is also said in the Qur'an: <br>The Prophet and the believers are not allowed to pray <br>for the forgiveness of 'mushrikin' (Plural of mushrik, <br>one who ascribes partners unto Allah) the polytheists <br>even if they are their relatives. <br><br>Part I (Hadith 14) <br>The Qur'anic ayat clearly say that polytheists will <br>never be forgiven. The intercession of huffaaz will, there- <br>fore, be for those Muslims whose entry into Hell has been <br>determined bv their sins. <br>Those who are not huffaaz and cannot memorize the -8 !-<br>Qur'an should at least make one of their relatives a hafis. :&<br>so that by His grace they may be saved from their own evil- <br>doings. <br>s.$<br>$21 <br>Allah be thanked for this gracious favour on the person <br>whose father, uncles and grandfathers both maternal and <br>paternal, were all huffaaz. (This applies to the author May <br>Allah bless him with more favours). <br>HADITH- 14 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Learn the Qur'an and recite it, because the example of <br>one who learns the Qur'an, reads it and recites it in Ta- <br>hajjud (salaat late after midnight) is like an open bag <br>full of musk, the fragrance whereof spreads over the <br>entire place, and a person who has learnt the Qur'an <br>but sleeps while the Qur'an is in his heart, is like a bag <br>full of musk but with its mouth closed.\" <br>It means that the example of one who learns the Quran and <br>cares for it and recites it in Tahajjud salaat is like that of a <br>musk-container which, if opened, fills the whole house <br>with its sweet smell. In the same way, the entire house is <br>lit up with divine light and blessings due to the recitation <br>by the hafiz. Even if the hafiz remains asleep or does not <br>recite through his negligence, the Qur'an in his heart is in <br>any case the musk. This negligence resulted in the loss that <br>others were deprived of the blessings of Qur'an, but his <br>heart does, in any case, contain the musk of Qur'an. <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH NO-15 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has <br>narrated the saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam): \"He in whose heart there is no part of the <br>Qur'an is like a deserted house.\" <br>The allusion to a deserted house has a subtle meaning, <br>which is expressed by the proverb that \"an idle man's <br>brain is the devil's workshop (literally the demon gets hold <br>of an empty house). Similarly a heart, devoid of Qur'an, <br>gets more and more possessed by Satan. What an emphasis <br>is there in this hadith for memorizing the Holy Qur'an, that <br>the heart which has not secured it has been likened to a de- <br>serted house. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"In <br>the house where the Qur'an is read, the household mem- <br>bers increase, virtues and blessings multiply, angels de- <br>scend upon them and Satan quits the house. Whereas the <br>house in which Qur'an is not recited, life therein becomes <br>straitened and devoid of blessings, angels leave the house <br>and Satan ravages it.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) and some <br>others have reported Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) to have said thdt a deserted house is one in which the <br>Holy Qur'an is not recited. <br>HADITH- 16 <br>*.<br>iwl dig\\ii13<br>~d & 2\\ @ <br>&j @G 2 (1,) <br>, , <br>o f  <br>@j <br>@&j\\ 23 @ .I$\\ ikIj,!*,23 +Tg\\!;\\,j> p\\ <br>I <br>0 ,  <br>I. d ,  <br>e>\\ <br>2 ,J&1 u&J\\, &j\\ 2 &i +I, <br>&\\,@\\ <br>,* C*, <br>8 . 5  <br>cJ dl <br>,y e fCpj <br>Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) says that Rasu- <br>lpllah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Recitation of</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>\"The likeness of five times daily salaat is as the like- <br>ness of a deep brook running in front of the door of a <br>person who bathes therein five times a day.\" <br>Running water is generally free from dirt, and the <br>deeper it runs the cleaner and purer it is. A bath in such <br>water surely removes dirt from the body and makes it <br>clean. Salaat offered with due regard for its essentials like- <br>wise cleanses the soul of all sins. There are several ahaa- <br>dith of the same meaning, though with slight variations in <br>expression, narrate& by different companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed <br>Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>'Each of the five salaats expiates the sins committed <br>since the salaat preceding it. To explain. let us take the <br>case of a person working in a factory. His job is such <br>that his body gets covered with dust. But there are five <br>streams of running water in between the factory and <br>his house and, on his return from the job, he takes a <br>bath in each stream. The effect of five times daily <br>salaat is quite similar. Any sins of omission and com- <br>mission between two salaats are forgiven on account of <br>'istighfaar and taubah in each salaat.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) through such <br>parables, aims at impressing that salaat has the wonderful <br>power of removing the sins. If we fail to avail of Allah's <br>mercy, surely we ourselves are the losers. <br>To err is human. We are likely to commit innumerable <br>acts of displeasing Allah and deserve thereby. His wrath <br>and punishment, but look how relenting our dear Allah is! <br>He has most graciously shown us the way to earn His <br>mercy and forgiveness. It is a great pity if we do not avail of <br>this great favour. Our Allah is always eager to show us His <br>mercy on very small grounds. It is said in a hadith, that if a <br>person goes to bed with the intention of getting up for Ta- <br>hajjud and perchance does not wake up, he receives the <br>full reward for Tahajjud, although he has been enjoying his <br>sleep at the time of Tahajjud. How boundless is the grace of <br>Allah and what a tremendous loss and deprivation if we do <br>not receive blessings from such a Giver. <br><br>i <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>\"Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that, <br>wvenever the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>h ppened to face any difficulty, he would at once <br>r9sort to salaat.\" <br>0,<br>vr B <br>P d  <br>Salaat is a great blessing of Allah. To resort to salaat at <br>the time of worry is to hasten towards His mercy, and <br>when Allah's mercy comes to rescue, there can remain no <br>trace of any worry. There are many traditions concerning <br>this practice of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Similar was the practice of his companions, who fol- <br>lowed him in the minutest detail. Hadhrat Abu Darda <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Whenever a strong wind blew, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would immedi- <br>ately enter the musjid and would not leave until the wind <br>had subsided. Similarly, at the time of a solar or lunar <br>eclipse, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would at <br>I \t<br>once start offering salaat. Hadhrat Suhaib (Radhiyallaho <br>I \t<br>anho) was informed by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that all the previous Apostles of Allah (peace be <br>upon them) also used to resort to salaat in all adversities. <br>Hadhrat Ibno Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was once on <br>journey. On his way he got the news of the death of his <br>I \t<br>son. He got down from his camel and offered two rakaat of <br>salaat, praying in Tashahhud for a long time. He then re- <br>cited 'Innaa liliaahi wa innaallaihi raaji-oon' and said, \"I <br>have done what Allah has ordered us to do in His Holy <br>Book i.e.: <br>!p\\j+I*\\, <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat\" (11: 45). <br>Another similar story is narrated about him. He was on <br>a journey when he received the news about the death of his <br>brother Quthum. He descended from his camel by the road- <br>side, and performed two rakaats of salaat and kept praying <br>in Tashahhud for a long time. After finishing his salaat, he <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>rode his camel reciting the following verse of the Holy <br>Qur'an: <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat, and truly <br>it is indeed hard except to the humble minded.\" <br>(11:45). <br>There is yet another story about him. On hearing of the <br>death of a wife of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), he fell down prostrate. When somebody asked him <br>the reason he said, \"Our dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had enjoined on us to prostrate (in salaat) when- <br>ever a calamity were to befall us. What calamity can be <br>greater than the death of the Ummul-Mo'mineen?\" <br>When Hadhrat Ubaada (Radhiyallaho anho) was about <br>to breathe his last, he said to the people around him, \"I <br>prohibit one and all from crying over me. When my soul <br>departs, I ask every one to perform wudhu, observing all its <br>essentials, and to go to the musjid and pray for my forgive- <br>ness, because our Gracious Allah has enjoined on us to <br>\"Seek help with patience and salaat.\" After that, lay me <br>down in the pit of my grave.\" <br>Hadhrat Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"Once it <br>became very dark during the day in Madina. I hurriedly <br>went to Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) to know if he <br>had ever experienced similar conditions during the life- <br>time of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He <br>said to me. \"M'aathallaah! During those blessed days, <br>whenever the wind blew strong, we would hurry to the <br>musjid lest it should be the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Salaam (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that whenever the members of the Prophet's family <br>were hardpressed in any way, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would enjoin upon then1 to say salaat, <br>and would recite the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be thyself <br>constant therein. We ask not of thee to provide suste- <br>nance. We provide it for thee. And the Hereafter is for <br>the righteousness.\" <br>(XX: 132). <br>It is said in a hadith that when somebody is confronted <br>with a need, whether pertaining to this life or the Hereafter, <br>or whether it concerns Allah or a mortal, he should per- <br>form a perfect wudhu, offer salaat of two rakaats, glorify <br>Allah, then ask blessing for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and then pray as under: <br>0,<br>k\", m <br>\"There is no god save Allah-the Clement-the Bouqti-<br>ful. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the tremendous <br>throne. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I ask <br>Thee all that leadeth to Thy Mercy and deserveth Thy <br>forgiveness. I ask Thee abundance in all that is good <br>and refuge from all that is evil. Leave me no sin but <br>Thou pardonest it, and no distress but Thou removest <br>it, and no need but Thou fulfillest it. 0,most Merciful <br>of those who show mercy!\" <br>Wahb bin Munabbih writes: \"Have your needs fulfilled <br>by Allah through salaat. In the good old time, if a calamity <br>befell the people, they would hurry towards salaat.\" It is <br>said that in Koofah there was a porter who was well known <br>for his honesty. People trusted him with their valuables <br>and money, which he carried from one place to another. <br>Once he wps on his usual errand when a person-met him <br>on the wayland asked him about his destination. When the <br>porter gave him the required information, k s a i d ,  \"I am <br>also bound for the same destination. If I could walk, I <br>would have accompanied you on foot. Will you kindly give <br>me a lift on your mule for one dinaar?\" The porter agreed <br>and allowed him to share the mule with him. They came to <br>a crossing on the way. The person said, 'Now, which road <br>will you take?' 'The main road, of course,' replied the <br>porter. The person said, 'No, brother. We should go by the <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>other road which is a shortcut and there is plenty of grass <br>enroute to feed the animal.' The porter said, 'I have never <br>been on this path.' The person remarked, 'But I have travel- <br>led by this route quite often'. The porter believed him and <br>put the animal on that path. After some distance, the path <br>ended in a terrifying forest where a large number of dead <br>bodies were lying about. All of a sudden the person <br>jumped down from the mule and took out his knife with <br>the intention of slaying the porter. 'Hold your hand', <br>shouted the porter, 'Take the animal and its load, but do <br>not kill me'. The person refused to listen to his entreaty <br>and swore that he would first kill the porter and then take <br>possession of the animal and the goads. Seeing that his en- <br>treaties fell on deaf ears and that his cruel heart would not <br>melt, the porter said to him, 'All right if you must kill me, <br>then permit to say my salaat of only two rakaats.' The <br>person agreed and remarked, 'You can please yourself. All <br>the dead you see over here made the same request, but <br>their salaat was of no avail to them.' The porter started the <br>salaat, but could not recollect any soorah to connect with <br>the Fatihah, in spite of his best efforts. Meanwhile the <br>person grew impatient and pressed him hard to hurry up <br>with the salaat. All of a sudden the following verse flashed <br>to his mind: <br>'Is it not He Who answereth the wronged one when he <br>crieth unto Him, and removeth the evil. .. (XXVII-62). <br>The porter was reciting the verse and the tears welled <br>up in his eyes, when a horseman suddenly appeared on the <br>scene. He was wearing a glittering helmet and held a spear <br>in his hand. He pierced the body of the pitiless rogue with <br>his spear and killed him there and then. A flame of fire <br>rose from the spot where the dead body fell. The porter fell <br>down prostrate and thanked Allah. After finishing his <br>salaat, he ran towards the horseman and requested him to <br>disclose his identity. He replied, 'I am a slave to Him who <br>answereth the wronged one. You are now safe and can go <br>wherever you like.' Saying this, the horseman rode away <br>and disappeared. \" <br>Indeed salaat is a tremendous asset. Besides pleasing <br>Allah it often gets us deliverence from the calamities of this</p></div>"

In a narration by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have warned against being wrong-headed in com- <br>mitting sins in the hope of getting them redeemed through <br>salaat. We have, really, no ground to behave as such on <br>this account. After all, what is the quality of the salaat that <br>we offer? If Allah merely absolves us of our obligation it is <br>His very special favour and grace. Again it is the height of <br>ingratitude to disobey Allah just because He is Clement, <br>Merciful and Forgiving. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"Two persons of one clan came to Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and embraced Islam at one and the <br>same time. One of these was martyred in a battle and <br>the other died a year later, Hadhrat Talha bin Ubaidul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he saw in his dream <br>that the person who had died later was admitted into <br>Paradise before the martyr. This surprised him. I do <br>not recollect whether it was he or somebody else who <br>narrated this dream. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thereupon remarked: \"Has not the person <br>dying later fasted for one additional month of Rama- <br>dhaan, and has he not offered six thousand or odd ra- <br>kaats of salaat more during the year he lived after the <br>martyr?\" <br>Really, we do not know how valuable salaat is! The <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was often heard <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>2 3 <br>saying, \"The comfort of my eyes is in salaat.\" This is an ex- <br>pression of his profound love for salaat. As such, what else <br>can be more valuable than salaat? <br>Hadith.VII1 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"At the approach of the hour of a salaat, an <br>Angel is deputed to proclaim, 'Arise, 0 Children of <br>Aadam! and extinguish the fire that you have (by com- <br>mitting sins) kindled to burn yourselves. So, the <br>people rise up, perform wudhu and offer their Zuhr <br>prayer. This causes forgiveness of their sins committed <br>since day-break. The same is repeated at Asr, Maghrib <br>and Ishaa. After Ishaa people go to bed, but there are <br>some who busy themselves in good, while some others <br>in evil deeds. <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"After <br>Ishaa the people get divided into three groups. There are <br>some for whom the night is a source of blessing and gain. <br>They are those who spend it in the worship of Allah, while <br>other people are asleep. For them the night brings great <br>reward from their Lord. There are others who turn their <br>night into a burden and curse for themselves, for they in- <br>dulge in various dark deeds in the dead of night. To them <br>the night brings woe and misery. There is the third group <br>of people who go to bed immediately after Ishaa; they <br>neither gain nor lose.\" <br>Hadith.1X <br>djG 5, JG <br>I j&; j G  JG <br>A, &j gj$ hij &i2 <br>O<br>,<br> <br>,J+<br>3. ai <br>..A@, +,& <br>&i 3 b$,J&, <br>*+<br>>f!</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>24 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Hadbrat Abu Qataadah bin Rab'iyy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"He heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, Allah has said, \"0, Muhammad! I <br>have ordained five times daily salaat for thy followers. <br>I have made a covenant with myself that whosoever is <br>regular in performing his salaat at its fixed hour, he <br>shall be admitted into the Paradise. Those of thy fol- <br>lowers who do not guard their salaat, are not included <br>in this covenant.\" <br>In another hadith, it is said that Allah has ordained <br>five times salaat and whosoever is mindful of his salaat, by <br>doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with <br>sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah of his entry into <br>Paradise; and whosoever does not guard his salaat, there is <br>no such guarantee for him; he may-or may not be forgiven. <br>salaat has indeed a tremendous value. It affords us an op- <br>portunity to 'receive Allah's guarantee for Paradise. When <br>an honourable person of some financial standing or having <br>executive power gives us a guarantee or stands surety for <br>meeting any of our requirements of this world, we feel <br>quite satisfied and happy and we consider it our duty to <br>remain obliged and devoted to him. Here Allah the Abso- <br>lute Sovereign of both the worlds, is giving the guarantee <br>and is standing surety for the real success after death in <br>return for five times daily salaat, which does not involve <br>much effort on our part. If even then we do not avail of the <br>opportunity, we shall have none to blame, but ourselves for <br>the dreadful doom that awaits us. <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Ibn Salmaan says that he heard one of the companions <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) nar- <br>rating, \"When we had won the battle of Khaibar, we <br>began to buy and sell among ourselves the booty that <br>had fallen to our lot. One of us went to Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, '0, Apostle of <br>Allah, no one else has earned so much profit as I have <br>obtained in today's trade.' 'How much did you earn? <br>asked the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He re- <br>plied, 'I kept on selling and buying till I earned a net <br>profit of three hundred 'Ooqiyyah' of silver.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I <br>inform you of something better than that?\" He ex-<br>claimed, 'Do tell me, 0,Prophet of Allah!' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked 'Two rakaats <br>nafl after (fardh) salaat.\" <br>Three hundred Ooqiyyahs of silver come to about three <br>thousand rupees. According to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), the perishable gain of this world stands <br>no comparison with the everlasting gain of the Hereafter. <br>Our life will be pleasant and worth living if we develop our <br>'Imaan' to an extent where two rakaats of salaat, in our <br>sight, are more valuable than all the riches of this world. <br>salaat is really a great treasure and that is why the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of <br>his eyes' and had been enjoining its observance right up to <br>his last breath. Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that the last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), which he could hardly utter, were about guard- <br>ing the salaat and kindness towards the slaves. There is a <br>similar hadith narrated by Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>as well. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once deputed <br>in Jihaad a Jamaat towards Najd. They returned victorious <br>very soon with a handsome booty. When the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saw the people envying them and <br>wondering at their quick and lucrative return, he said to <br>them, \"Shall I inform you of a group of people who earn <br>much more in a much shorter time? They are those who <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>perform their Fajr with Jamaat and keep sitting after prayer <br>till a little while after sunrise and then offer two rakaats of <br>salaat.\" According to Shaqeeq Balkhi, a very famous <br>Shaikh, five things could be acquired through five chan- <br>nels; an increase in provisions through 'Chaasht' a light in <br>the grave through Tahajjud, a very satisfactory answer to <br>Munkar and Nakeer through the recitation of the Qur'an; an <br>easy crossing of Siraat through fasting and alms, and room <br>under the shade of Allah's Throne on the Day of Judgement <br>through seclusion (i.e. Zikr). <br>There are so many sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) enjoining salaat and explaining its <br>virtues that it is very difficult to cover all of them in this <br>small book. A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in <br>the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in the matter of <br>salaat!. <br>3. \t \"SalCat intervenes between man and Shirk.\" <br>4.\t \"Salaat is the mark of Islam. A person who says <br>his salaat at the fixed hours with sincerity and de- <br>votion, observing all its regulations including the <br>Mustahabbaat, is surely a Mo'min.\" <br>5. \t \"Of all things that have been ordained by Allah, <br>Imaan and salaat are the most valued. If there were <br>any otber thing better than salaat, then Allah <br>would have ordained it for His Angels, some of <br>whom are always in ruku and others in sajdah.\" <br>6. \t \"Salaat is the pillar of Islam.\" <br>7. \t \"Salaat abases the Devil.\" <br>8. \t \"Salaat is the light of a Mo'min.\" <br>9. \"Salaat is the best Jihaad.\" <br>10. \t \"Allah keeps relenting towards a person so long as <br>he is engaged in salaat.\" <br>11. \"When a calamity befalls us from the heaven, <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>people frequenting the musjid are spared and <br>saved.\" <br>12. \t \"If some major sins of a Muslim land him in Hell, <br>the fire would not burn those parts of his body <br>which have touched the ground while he was in <br>sajdah during his salaat.\" <br>13. \t \"Fire has been forbidden to touch those parts of <br>the body which touch the ground while perform- <br>ing the sajdah.\" <br>% <br>14. \"Of all the practices, salaat made at fixed hours is 8 <br>5<br>most loved by Allah.\" \t<br>.-<br>L V ~<br>> <br>15. \"Allah likes most the posture of a person when he <br>is in sajdah, pressing his forehead on the ground <br>in humility.\" <br>16. \"A person in sajdah is nearest unto Allah.\" <br>17. \"Sa1aa.t is a key to Paradise.\" <br>18. \"When a person stands in salaat the gates of Par- <br>adise are let open and all the veils between him <br>and Allah are lifted (provided that he spoils not <br>his salaat by coughing etc).\" <br>19. \"A person in salaat (so to say) knocks at the door <br>of the sovereign Lord, and the door is always <br>opened for him who knocks.\" <br>20. \t \"The position of salaat in Islam is as the position <br>of the head in a body.\" <br>21. \t \"Salaat is the light of the heart. Let those who <br>wish enlighten their hearts (through salaat)\". <br>22. \"If \t a person wishes to have his sins forgiven by <br>Allah, he should perform the wudhu properly, <br>offer with devotion two or four rak'aats of fardh or <br>nafl and then pray to Allah. Allah will forgive <br>him.\" <br>23. \t \"Any strip of earth, on which Allah is remem-<br>bered in salaat, takes pride over the rest of the <br>Earth.\" <br>24. \"Allah accepts the prayer of a person who prays to <br>Him after performing two rakaats of salaat. Allah <br>grants him what he prays for, sometimes immedi- <br>ately and sometimes (in his own interest) later.\" <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>25. \t \"A person who performs two rakaats of salaat in <br>seclusion, where nobody except Allah and His <br>Angels see him, receives a writ of deliverance <br>from the fire of hell.\" <br>26. \t \"Grant of one prayer (wish) becomes due to a <br>person from Allah after each fardh salaat per-<br>formed by him.\" <br>27. \t \"Fire of Hell is forbidden and the Paradise be- <br>comes due to a person who performs his wudhu <br>properly and says his salaat conscientiously, <br>according to its regulations.\" \t<br>28. \t \"The Devil remains scared of a Muslim so long as <br>he is particular about his salaat, but no sooner <br>does he neglect it than the Devil gets a hold upon <br>him and aspires for success in seducing him.\" <br>29. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is the most excellent <br>practice.\" <br>30. \t \"Salaat is the offering of the pious.\" <br>31. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is a practice most liked <br>by Allah.\" \t<br>32. \t \"At dawn, some people go to the musjid and some <br>to the market. Those going to the musjid are the <br>flag-bearers of Imaan and those leaving for the <br>market are the flag-bearers of the Devil.\" <br>33. \t \"The four rakaats before Zuhr have the same <br>reward as the four rakaats of Tahajjud.\" \t<br>34. \t \"The four rakaats before Zuhr are counted equal <br>(in reward) to the four rakaats of Tahajjud.\" <br>35. \t \"Mercy of Allah turns towards a person standing <br>in salaat.\" \t<br>36. \t \"Salaat at the dead of night is most valued, but <br>there are very few who do it.\" <br>37. \t \"Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) came to me and said, <br>0,Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! how- <br>ever long thou livest thou shalt die one day, and <br>whoever, thou may love thou shalt depart from <br>him one day. Surely, thou shalt receive the recom- <br>pense of whatever (good or evil) thou dost. No \t<br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>doubt the dignity of a Mo'min is in Tahajjud and <br>his honour is in contentment and restraint.\" <br>38. \t \"Two rakaats in the late hours of the night are more <br>valuable than all the riches of this world. But for <br>fear of hardship to my followers, I would have <br>made these obligatory.\" <br>39. \t \"Keep offering Tahajjud, for it is the path of the <br>righteous and the means of approach to Allah. Ta- <br>hajjud keeps one away from sins, causes forgive- <br>ness of sins and improves the health of the body.\" <br>(r0 % <br>3 B <br>40. \t \"Allah says, '0,son of Aadam! Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the <br>comfort of his eyes and used to spend the major part of the <br>night standing before Allah. For the very same reason, our <br>dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even on his<br>death-bed charged us and enjoined on us to be particular <br>about salaat. It has been reported in many ahaadith that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often say, <br>\"Fear Allah concerning salaat.\" Abdullah bin Mas'ood, <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"Of all the practices, <br>salaat is the dearest to me.\" <br>One of the Sahabah narrates, \"One night I happened to <br>go to the musjid. I found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) in salaat. I felt an ardent desire to join him. I made <br>I <br>my intention and stood behind him; he was reciting 'Baqa- <br>rah' at that time. I thought that he would finish the qiraat <br>and go for ruku at the end of the hundredth verse, but he <br>did not do so. Then I thought he would perhaps go to ruku <br>after finishing two hundred verses, but he did not stop <br>even there. I was sure then that he would finish qiyaam <br>with the end of the soorah. When the soorah ended he <br>hymned, 'Allahumma Lakalhamd' (Allah! Thine is all <br>Glory) a number of times and then started 'Aal Imraan'. On <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak, the famous Soofi, writes, <br>\"My neighbour at Koofah had a son. The boy fasted during <br>the day and kept praying and hymning during the night. <br>This constant strain emaciated him so much that his body <br>was reduced to a skeleton. His father requested me to ad- <br>monish him. Once I was sitting at my door when the boy <br>passed by. He greeted me with 'Assalaamu alaikum' and sat <br>down. I had hardly said anything when he interrupted <br>saying, 'Dear Uncle! Maybe you intend to admonish me to <br>reduce my pursuits. Listen to my story first. I had a few <br>friends in the locality. We decided among ourselves to vie <br>with one another in worship and adoration of Allah. They <br>all applied themselves so hard that they were soon sent for <br>by Allah. They embraced death delightedly and peacefully. <br>Now I am the only one left behind. What will they think of <br>me when they know of my lagging behind? Dear Uncle! My <br>friends really strived very hard and achieved their goal,' He <br>then began to relate the pursuits and accomplishments of <br>his departed friends, which astonished all the listeners. <br>After this he left me. I heard a few days later that the boy <br>too had died (May Allah bless him).\" <br>Even in these days there are persons who remain en- <br>gaged in salaat for the major portion of the night and <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat <br>Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I love most <br>are: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and reciting the <br>Qur'an.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). \"And I love the three things most: serving a guest, <br>fasting on a very hot day and smiting the enemy with my <br>sword.\" At this, Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) appeared on the <br>scene and said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Allah has sent me to tell you what I would love if I be one <br>of the mortals.\" \"Yes, do tell us, Jibra-eel\", said the <br>Prophet. jibra-eel then replied, \"If I had been like you, I <br>would have loved three things: guiding the people gone <br>astray, loving those who worship in poverty and helping <br>the poor family men. And as for Allah, He loves three <br>I \t<br>characteristics of His slaves: striving in His Path, crying at <br>the time of repentance, and steadfastness in want and <br>hunger.\" <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim writes: 'Salaat ensures daily bread, <br>promotes health, drives out diseases, strengthens the heart, <br>brings light and beauty on the face, pleases the soul, re- <br>freshes the body, cures indolence, relieves the mind, feeds <br>the soul, illumines the heart and guarantees Allah's favour. <br>It grants protection against Allah's Doom. It keeps the Devil <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>WARNING AND REPROACH FOR NEGLECTING <br>SALAAT <br>The books on hadith mention very severe punishment <br>for those who neglect salaat. From many traditions on the <br>s,ubject, only a few are reproduced in this chapter. <br>Although a single warning from the most truthful Prophet <br>3E j,<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was enough, yet we find that, grn<br>out of love and mercy for his followers, he has cautioned <br>them again and again and in various manners lest they <br>should neglect salaat and suffer the consequences. In spite <br>of all this, alas! we are unmindful of salaat, and still we <br>have the audacity to consider ourselves devotees of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and champions of <br>Islam. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>1. \t \"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr and <br>Shirk.\" <br>3. \t \"Discarding of salaat is the only partition between <br>Imaan and Kufr.\" <br>There are a number of ahaadith on the subject. On one <br>occasion, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said: \"Hurry up with your salaat when it <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us! <br>Hadhrat IJbaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates. 'My. dear friend the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) while enjoining upon me seven good prac- <br>tices said, \"Do not ascribe anything as partner to Allah, <br>though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not forego salaat intentionally, lest you <br>should get out of the fold of Islam; do not perpetrate <br>disobedience of Allah, lest you deserve His wrath; and <br>do not take to drinking, for that is the mother of all <br>evils'.\" <br>In another hadith, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"My dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>warned me saying, 'Do not ascribe anything as partner unto <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar-<br>rates: \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined upon me ten things, viz, 'Do not ascribe <br>anything as partner unto Allah, though you may be <br>slain or burnt alive; do not disobey your parents. <br>though you may have to part with your wife or your <br>entire wealth; do not neglect fardh salaat, intention- <br>ally, for Allah is free from obligation to a person who <br>neglects fardh salaat intentionally; do not take wine, <br>for it is an evil habit; that is the root of every uice; do <br>not commit disobedience of Allah, for that brings the <br>wrath of Allah. Do not turn your back to the enemy in <br>battle, though all your comrades may have fallen. Do <br>not fly from the locality where an epidemic has broken <br>out. Do spend on your family members according to <br>your capacity; let your rod be hanging on them, as a <br>warning and to chastise against neglect of their duties <br>towards Allah.\" <br>According to this hadith, we should not spare the roci <br>in checking the children from becoming reckless ih doing <br>anything they like. Sometimes it is necessary to use the <br>rod. It is a pity that out of love we do not use the rod in the <br>beginning and, when the children get spoilt, we cry and</p></div>"

Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\" <br>Hadhrat Naufil bin Mu'aawiyah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"A person who has missed one <br>salaat is like one who has lost all his family and <br>wealth.\" <br>Salaat is missed usually when either a person is in the <br>company of his family members or is in pursuit of money. <br>According to this hadith, the ultimate loss sustained in <br>missing a salaat is in no way less than the loss of the whole <br>family and property. In other words, if we miss a salaat we <br>should be as much grieved as when we lose all of our folk <br>and entire belongings. If we are cautioned by some reliable <br>person about the presence of gangsters on a certain road, <br>where people are robbed and killed during the night, we <br>need a lion's heart to ignore the caution and travel on that <br>road even during the day time. Strange enough to note that <br><br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>themselves as practical Muslims perform a number of their <br>salaats in combination on returning home, on the very <br>feeble excuses of travel, trade or occupation. To put salaat <br>off till after its set time without a strong excuse (illness, <br>etc) is a major sin. Although it is not so disastrous as neg- <br>lecting salaat, yet it is quite serious. <br>Hadith VI <br>Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while <br>talking about salaat said: \"For its votary, salaat \"shall on <br>the Day of Judgement, be a light for him, an argument <br>in his favour, and a means of his deliverance. Whereas <br>there will be no light, no defence and no deliverance <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from doom for him who does not guard his salaat, and <br>he shall meet the fate of Pharoah, Haamaan and Ubbay <br>bin Khalaf.\" <br>Everybody knows that Pharoah-the big disbeliever-- <br>had been so arrogant that he proclaimed himself 'Lord the <br>Highest' and made his people worship him. Haamaan was <br>his Chief Minister and accomplice. Ubbay bin Khalaf was <br>the most active and severest enemy of Islam among the dis- <br>believers of Mecaa. Before the Hijrah, he used to announce <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) most insolently, <br>\"I have reared a horse, which I feed very well; I will slay <br>you one day riding on its back.\" Once the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied to him, \"Inshaa-allaah! you <br>shall meet your end at my hands.\" In the battle of Uhud, he <br>ran about in the field in search of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is not slain today, then I stand no chance of sur- <br>viving.\" He at last found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and advanced to attack him. The Companions <br>decided to finish him before he reached the Prophet, but <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stopped them. <br>When he came near, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) took a spear from one of the companions and struck <br>him with it, causing a little scratch on his neck. He stag- <br>gered and fell down from his horse and then fled towards <br>his camp crying, \"By Allah, Mtlkammad (SaHallaho alaihe <br>wasalhm) has killed me!\" His people tried to cansole him <br>and told him that it was only a bruise and there was noth- <br>ing to worry h u t ,  but he would say, \"Muhammad (~allal- <br>laho alaihe wasellam) had once announced to me in Mecca <br>that he would kill me. By Allah, had he only spat at me, I <br>would be no more.\" It is said that he cried like a bull. Abu <br>Sufyan, who was very active on that day, put him to shame <br>for crying in that manner over a slight wound, but he said, <br>\"Do you know who has inflicted this injury upon me? It <br>was none other than Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). By Laat and Uzza! if my agony be distributed over all <br>the people of Hijaaz, none of them would survive. Since <br>the time he had declared that he would kill me, I was sure <br>that I would meet my death at his hands. If he only spat at <br>me after that declaration, I would be no more.\" So he died <br>on his way hack, at a day's journey from Mecca. <br>Look! a disbeliever like Ubbay bin Khalaf is so sure <br>about the truth of the Prophet's words that he does not <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of <br>punishment, who knows, may last for thousands of years. <br>Hadith VII <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favours on <br>a person who is mindful of his salaat, viz: His daily bread <br>is made easy for him; he is saved from the punishments in <br>the grave; he shall receive his record in his right hand on <br>the Day of Judgement; he shall cross the Siraat with the <br>speed of lightning and he shall enter Paradise without reck- <br>oning. As for him who neglects his salaat, he shall meet <br>five types of punishments in this world, three at the time of <br>death, three in the grave and three after resurrection. <br>Those in this world are: he is not blessed in life; he is <br>deprived of the light with which the faces of the righteous <br>are endowed; he receives no rewards for his good practices; <br>his prayers are not answered; and he has no share in the <br>prayers of the pious. Those at the time of death are: he dies <br>disgracefully; he dies hungry; he dies in thirst; which the <br>water in the oceans of the world cannot quench. <br>Those in the grave are: He is so squeezed there that the <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other side; fire <br>is burnt inside for him and he is rolled on cinders day and <br>night; a serpent with fiery eyes and iron nails equal in <br>length to a day's journey is let loose on him and shouts <br>with a thundering voice, 'My Lord has charged me with <br>thrashing you till sunrise for neglecting Fajr, till Asr for <br>neglecting Zuhur, till sunset for neglecting Asr, till Ishaa <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in <br>mind that even after the declaration of a person as being <br>guilty, Allah is free to pardon him as and when he pleases. <br>He says in His Holy Book: <br>\"Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be as- <br>cribed unto Him. Allah pardoneth all (save that) whom <br>He will. <br>(IV: 116)\" <br>If then it pleases Allah to pardon anybody neglecting <br>salaat, it will be most fortunate; but who can be sure of this <br>fortune? <br>It is also stated in hadith that there will be three courts <br>to be held by Allah on the Day of Judgement. The first will <br>judge between kufr and islaam and there will be no pardon. <br>The second will be to judge the duties and conduct of one <br>towards another. All aggrieved shall be compensated there; <br>compensation will either be realised from the aggressor or <br>paid by Allah Himself, if He pleases to pardon anybody. <br>The third will deal with duties towards Allah. Here the <br>doors of Allah's mercy will be thrown wide-open and He <br>shall pardon anybody He wills. In the light of all that has <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>to have seen (in his dream) a group of people being treated <br>likewise. Jiba-eel (Alayhis salaam) informed him on his <br>query that thpse were the persons who used to neglect their <br>salaat. <br>Mujahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"Allah blesses the <br>people who guard their salaat, just as he blessed Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) and his descendants.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If a <br>person dies with sincere Imaan, observing the command- <br>ments of Allah, performing salaat, and paying Zakaat, <br>when he dies Allah is pleased with him.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Allah says, 'I hold back retribution, deserved by a locality, <br>when I see therein some people who frequently visit the <br>musjid, love one another for My sake, and pray for forgive- <br>ness in the hours of darkness.\" <br>Hadhmt Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) wrote to <br>Hadhrat Salmaan: \"Spend most of your time in the musiid. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"The musjid is the abode of the pious. Allah has <br>taken upon Himself to bless the person who spends most of <br>I <br>I<br>I <br>I <br>I <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand- <br>ing at a distance.\" <br>One of the companions reports that, when the inmates <br>of the Prophet's house were hard-pressed in any way, he <br>would enjoin salaat on them and recite the following verse: <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision, We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for the righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that she heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"All the <br>people will be gathered together on the Day of Judgement <br>and they will all hear the voice of the announcing angel. <br>He will say, 'where are those who glorified Allah in ease <br>and adversity?' A group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. It will then be announced, 'where are <br>those who forsook their beds and spent their nights in <br>worship?' Another group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. The angel will again announce, 'where <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The <br>reckoning will then commence after these three groups <br>have been eliminated.\" <br>It is said that during the early times people could see <br>Satan. A person approached him saying how could he be <br>like him. Satan told him that had he never received such a <br>request before and asked hin? what had prornpted him to <br>ask for it. The person told him that he wished it from his <br>heart. Satan told him to neglect his salaat and to swear very <br>frequently, not caring whether he was doir~g it truthfully. <br>The person told Satan that he would swear by Allah never <br>to give up salaat and swear falsely. Satan told him that <br>never before he had been tricked by a human being to seek <br>his advice. He was determined never to do so in future. <br>Xadhrat Ubayv (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Give glad tidings to the Muslims that they shall be hon- <br>oured and exalted, and their religion shall prevail, but <br>there is no portion in the Hereafter for those who exploit <br>Islam for wordlv gains.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"I saw Allah in His best form. He said to me, '0 <br>'Muhammad! what are the Highest Chiefs (Angels) arguing <br>about'?' I said, 'I have no knowledge about that.' Allah <br>i<br>I <br>, <br>l <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the <br>questioning of Angels, is a shade against the Sun on the <br>Day of Judgement, is a protection against the fire of Hell, is <br>a weight for the scales of good deeds, is a means of swift <br>crossing over the Siraat arid is a key to Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthmarl (Radhiyallaho anho) is reported to <br>have said. \"Allah bestows nine fdvours on a person who <br>guards his salaat and is particular in performing it at its ap- <br>pointed hours: viz; He is loved by Allah, he enjoys good <br>health, is constantly under the protection of angels, his <br>home is blessed, the light of righteousrless shines on his <br>face, his heart is made soft, he shall cross the Siraat with <br>the speed of lightning, he is saved from Hell, and his neigh- <br>bours in Paradise are those about whom Allah has said. <br>'There shall be no fear come upon them, neither shall <br>they grieve (11: 36). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Salaat <br>is the Pillar of Islam and it has ten virtues, viz: It is a charm <br>of the face, a light of the heart, health and refreshment for <br>the bodv, a companv in the grave, a means for the descent <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and <br>one who neglects Zuhr as '0 you loser', and one who ig- <br>nores Asr as '0 you transgressor', and one who omits <br>Maghrib as '0 you kaafir', and one who does not say Ishaa <br>as '0you violator of Allah's commandments.\" <br>Alama Sha'raani (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"It should <br>be clearly understood that a calamity is drawn off from a <br>locality the people of which are particular about salaat, <br>whereas a locality the people of which neglect salaat is fre- <br>quently visited by calamities. Earthquakes, thunderbolts <br>and sinking of houses are not unexpected where people are <br>not particular about salaat. Simply guarding one's own <br>salaat is not enough, because when a calamity strikes, it <br>does not befall the wrongdoers alone. It affects everybody <br>in that locality. Once the Sahabah asked the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Can we perish while there are <br>pious people among us?\" the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) replied, \"Yes, if vice becomes predominant.\" It <br>is therefore necessary that other people should also be en- <br>joined to stick to Allah's commandments and refrain from <br>wrongdoing. <br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0 <br>Allah! cause not any one of us to be a wretched destitute.'? <br>He then said: \"Do you know who is a wretched destitute?\" <br>At the'request of the companions, he explained to them <br>saying, \"A wretched destitute is he who neglects his salaat. <br>In Islaam there is nothing for him.\" In another hadith it is <br>said, \"Allah will not care a bit for the person who has been <br>neglecting salaat intentionally, and for him shall be an <br>awful doom.\" <br>It is reported in a hadith that ten persons will be <br>specially tormented, and one of them will be the person <br>who neglects his salaat. It is said that his hands will be tied <br>while the angels shall smite him on his face and back. Par- <br>adise will tell him, 'In me there is no room for you,' and <br>Hell will sav to him, 'Come to me. You are for me and I am <br>for you.' It is also reported that there is a valley in Hell <br>named Lamlam. This vallev is infested with serpents as fat <br>as the neck of a camel and as long as one month's journey. <br>A person neglecting salaat shall be tormented in this <br>valley. 111 another hadith, it is reported that there is a vale <br>in the Hell. which is krlown as the Pit of Grief; it is infested <br>with scorpions of the size of a mule. This place is also <br>meant for tormenting the people who neglect salaat. Of <br>course, there is nothing to worry if the most merciful Allah <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"There is no place in Islaam for a person who <br>does .not say his salaat, and there is no salaat without <br>wudhu.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) also heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying. \"There is no Islaam in a person when <br>there is no salaat by him. The position of salaat in <br>Islaam is as the position of the head in a body.\" <br>Let those who do not offer salaat, and not onlv call <br>themselves Muslims, but also boast of their being cham- <br>pions of the Muslim cause, ponder over these words of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They dream of <br>reviving the past glory of Islaam. but would not care to <br>know how rigidly the people responsible for that glory <br>stuck to the practices of Islaam. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhivallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eve. People told him that the dis- <br>ease could be treated, but he would have to miss his salaat <br>for a few days. He said: \"This is not possible; I have heard <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer- <br>tain man and said, \"Take this one; he is particular about <br>his salaat. But you are not to beat him. We are forbidden to <br>beat one who says salaat.\" We, on the other hand, mock at <br>our servant and consider him a liability if he goes for <br>salaat. <br>Sufyaan 'rhauri (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous Soofi <br>once fell into a state of ecstasy. He remained in his house <br>for seven days without sleep, food and drink. When his <br>Shaikh was informed of his condition, he inquired if Su- <br>fyaan was observing the hours of his salaat. He was told <br>that his salaat was quite regular and safe. At this, the <br>Shaikh remarked, \"Glory be to Allah, Who has not allowed <br>the Devil to have an upper hand on him! \" <br><br>PART I1 <br>IMPORTANCE OF JAMAAT <br>As has already been said in tne foreword, there are many <br>who say their salaat regularly but are not very particular <br>about Jamaat. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>as emphatic in enjoining Jamaat as he is particular about <br>salaat. This part also consists of two chapters. The first <br>deals with the rewards of Jamaat and the second with the <br>consequences of its neglect. <br>CHAPTER I <br>REWARDS OF JAMAAT <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) saying: \"A salaat with Jamaat is twenty-seven <br>times superior to salaat performed individually.\" <br>When we offer our salaat for getting reward from <br>Allah, then why should it not be done in the musjid, where <br>the reward earned is twenty-seven times more. Nobody <br>will be so unwise as to forego a profit twenty-seven times <br>greater with simply a little extra labour. But we are so in- <br>different about the profits promised for our religious prac- <br>tices! This can be due to nothing but our disregard for deen <br>and the rewards of it. It is a pity that we apply ourselves so <br>hard to acquiring the trifling gains in this material world; <br>but are so unmindful of the gains in the Hereafter, which <br>yield twenty-seven times more with a little extra effort. We <br>often argue that for going to the musjid for Jamaat we have <br>to close the shop and will thus lose business. These pre- <br>texts and others of the kind cannot stand in the way of <br>those who have perfect faith in the Greatness of Allah, and <br><br>Part I1 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>28 <br>in His word; and who realize the value of the blessings and <br>reward in the Hereafter. It is in respect of such people that <br>Allah says: <br>\"Men, whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>then from remembrance of Allah and constancy in <br>salaat.\" <br>(XXIV;37). <br>It is said of Saalim Haddaad (Rahmatullah alaih] (a .-,-<br>trader and a great Soofi) that on hearing Azaan he would <br>g 2<br>turn pale and grow restless. He would stand up immedi- .Ez<br>ately, leaving his shop open and recite these couplets:- <br>><br>1. \"When Thy summoner stands up to summon, <br>quickly I stand up. <br>To respond to (the summons of) The Mighty Lord <br>Who hath no peer.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"I reply to the summons with complete submis- <br>sion and cheer, 'Here am I, 0 Bountiful One.\" <br>3. \t<br>\"My face grows pale with awe and fear, and occu- <br>pation in Thee distracts me from all other occupa- <br>tions.\" <br>4. <br>\"I swear by Thee, naught is dear to me save Thy <br>remembrance. <br>Nothing is more ravishing for me than Thy sweet <br>name.\" <br>5. \t \"0,will th'ere be a time for us to be together? <br>A lover is happy only when he is with his love.\" <br>6. \"He whose eyes have seen the light of Thy Beauty <br>Can never be solaced. He must die yearning for <br>Thee.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"People frequenting the musjid <br>are its pegs (dwellers). Angels are their companioris and <br>visit them when they are sick and help them when they are <br>at their jobs.\" <br>Hadith I1 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\" <br>In Hadith No. I, the superiority of salaat with Jamaat <br>over that offered individually is described as being twenty- <br>seven times more, while this hadith mentions only twenty- <br>five times. Various theologians have discussed at length <br>this seeming inconsistency. The following are some of the <br>explanations: <br>1. \t \"This variation from twenty-five to twenty-seven <br>is due to variation of ikhlaas (sincerity) in differ- <br>ent individuals.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"In Sirri (quiet) salaat (i.e., Zuhr and Asr), it is <br>twenty-five times, while in Jahri (loud) salaat (i.e., <br>Fajr, Maghrib and Ishaa), it is twenty-seven <br>times.\" <br>3. \t \"In Fajr and Ishaa, when it is somewhat incon- <br>venient to go out due to cold and darkness, it is <br>twenty-seven times, but in other salaats it is <br>twenty-five times.\" <br>4. \t \"In the beginning it was twenty-five times, but <br>subsequently Allah (by special favour on the fol- <br>lowers of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>raised the reward to twenty-seven times.\" <br>1 <br>I <br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the <br>ihraam (Hajj apparel) at his house, leaves for Hajj\". <br>Further, in the same hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) points to another act of great value; i.e., as <br>long as one remains sitting in musjid after the salaat is <br>over, the angels pray for him asking for forgiveness and <br>mercy. The angels are the innocent and holy creation of <br>Allah. So, the effectiveness of their prayers is self-evident. <br>Muhammad bin Samaak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous theologian and Sheikh. He died at the age of one <br>hundred and three. He used to perform two hundred <br>rakaats of nafl salaat daily. He writes: \"For forty years, I <br>never _missed the first takbeer of salaat with Jamaat, except <br>once when my mother had died.\" The same Shaikh writes: <br>\"Once I missed the Jamaat. As I knew that salaat with <br>Jamaat was twenty-five times superior, I repeated this <br>salaat (individually) twenty-five times to make up the loss. <br>I heard in my dream some one saying to me, 'Muhammad! <br>You have repeated your salaat 25 times (in the hope of <br>making good the loss), but what about the 'Aameen' by the <br>Angels?\" It is reported in many ahaadith that when the <br>Imaam says 'Aameen' after Fatihah, the Angels also say <br>Aameen and all the past sins of a person whose Ameen <br>coincides with that of the Angels are forgiven. This is <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: \"If one wishes to meet Allah on the Day of Judge- <br>ment as a Muslim, he must say his salaat at a place <br>where Azaan is called out, viz., a musjid, as Allah has <br>prescribed through His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) such practices which are nothing but guid- <br>ance through and through: and salaat (with Jamaat) is <br>one of them. If you start saying your salaat at your <br>houses (as.so and so is doing), then vou will be dis-<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) led the salaat at his instance, and <br>he himself joined the Jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to him, <br>\"Worship your Lord as if you see Him before you, count <br>yourself among the dead, beware of the curse of the <br>wronged ones and, even if you could crawl to the musjid, <br>do not miss Ishaa and Fajr with Jamaat.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"Ishaa and Fajr are very <br>heavy on those who are munaafiq. If they knew the reward <br>of the Jamaat, they would go to the musjid and join the <br>Jamaat even if they had to crawl.\" <br>Hadith IV <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Maalik (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>saying, \"A person who in all sincerity is constant in <br>his salaat with Jamaat for forty days, without missing <br>the first takbeer, recieves two awards: one for deliv- <br>erance from Hell and the ~ t h e r  for freedom from <br>nifaaq.\" <br>If a person is regular in his salaat (with sincerity) for <br>forty days and joins the Jamaat from the very start (i.e., <br>when the Imaam calls out his first takbeer), then he shan <br>neither be a munaafiq nor shall he go to Hell. A munaafiq <br>is a person who feigns being a Muslim, but there is kufr in <br>his heart., Genesis of man (according to hadith) takes place <br>in periods of forty days. This seems to be the significance <br>of forty days in this hadith, and so the Soofis attach import- <br>ance to this period (called Chillah in Urdu) for purposes of <br>spiritual discipline. <br>Lucky indeed are the persons who do not miss their <br>first takbeer for years together. <br>Hadith V <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who performs wudhu scrupulously, <br>and then goes to the musjid and finds that Jamaat is <br>over, receives a reword equal to that of Jamaat. This <br>would not diminish anything from the reward of those <br>who have actually performed their salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>This is indeed Allah's great favour and beneficence <br>that the mere effort and a slight exertion is enough to en- <br>title us to a reward of Jamaat, though actually we fail to <br>join it. Who is the loser then if we ourselves get left, and <br>miss the bounties of the most Bountiful? <br>This hadith also shows that we-should not postpone <br>going to the musjid in apprehension of the Jamaat being <br>over. Even if we find on reaching the musjid that Jamaat is <br>over, we will still get the reward thereof. If, however, we <br>are certain that the Jamaat is already over, then there is of <br>course no idea in going to the musjid for Jamaat. <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not <br>correct, as in the first place they are deprived of the reward <br>of saying salaat in the musjid and secondly, they lose the <br>blessing of salaat with a big Jamaat. The bigger the congre- <br>gation, the more pleasing it is to Allah. When our sole dim <br>is to achieve the pleasure of Allah, why should we not <br>adopt a manner more pleasing to Him. It is reported in a <br>hadith that Allah is pleased to see three things, namely, a <br>row of worshippers offering salaat with Jamaat, a persor, <br>busy in salaat at the time of Tahajjud at the dead of night, <br>and a person fighting in the way of Allah.\" <br>Hadith VII <br>Hadhrat Sahl bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Give glad tidings to those who go to the <br>musjid frequently during hours of darkness, for they <br>will have perfect light on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the <br>Qur'an' <br>\"He only shall tend Allah's musjid who believes in <br>Allah and the L,ast Day.\" <br>(IV:18).\" <br>The following are a few more ahaadith about the vir- <br>tues of salaat with Jamaat:- <br>1. \t \"Making wudhu when inconvenient, walking to- <br>wards 'the musjid and sitting there (after one <br>salaat), waiting for the next salaat, wipe out the <br>sins.\" <br>2. \t \"The farther a person lives from the 'musjid' the <br>greater the hlessing he receives.\" This is so be- <br>cause a person coming from a distance shall have <br>to walk more and, as already mentioned, every <br>step will fetch him a blessing. For this very reason <br>some companions have been reported to be taking <br>short steps in going to the musjid in order to earn <br>more blessings. <br>3. \t<br>\"There are three things in this world for which <br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>explain the importance of salaat with Jamaat, but their <br>explanations vary with the extent of their understanding <br>and their power to probe into Divine secrets. Our respected <br>Shaikh, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (may Allah illumine his <br>grave), in his famous Book 'Hujjatullahil Balighah' <br>writes:-<br>\"To save the people from the fatal effects that their <br>own customs and rituals can bring them, there is nothing <br>more useful than to make one of the religious services so <br>common a custom and so public a ritual that it may be per- <br>formed openly before everybody by any person, whether he <br>be learned or illiterate. The town-folk and the countrymen <br>should both be equally anxious to observe it. It should <br>become a subject of rivalry and pride among all of them, <br>and ~t should be so universally practised that it becomes <br>part and parcel of their social set-up, so much so, that life <br>without it may be worthless for them. If this is achieved, it <br>will help in establishing the worship and obedience of <br>Allah and will form a very useful substitute for those <br>rituals and customs which could cause them serious harm. <br>Since salaat is the only religious observance that surpasses <br>all others in importance and universality, both in reason <br>and authority, it becomes therefore absolutely necessary to <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>hearts and souls turned to Him alone, have the wonderful <br>effect of causing His blessings and Mercy to descend from <br>Heaven. <br>\"Moreover, the Muslim community has been raised so <br>that the word of Allah be held supreme and Islamic Order <br>be paramount over all others. This object cannot be <br>achieved unless all Muslims, big and small, the elite and <br>the common, the town folk and the countrymen, perform <br>alike the most sublime service and the most sacred ritual of <br>Islam (i.e., salaat) by assembling together in one place. It is <br>for this reason that the Sharee-at (Islamic Law) lays such <br>special stress on Friday congregation and on salaat with <br>jamaat, by explaining the blessings that accrue therefrom <br>and punishments awarded for neglect 1 lereof. For the open <br>and conspicuous observance of this im?ortant service, two <br>types of assemblies are required: one fr~rpeople of a clan or <br>a particular locality and the other for the people of the <br>whole town. Since the assembly or\" the former at any hour <br>is convenient and that of the latte, comparatively difficult, <br>so for the former, the gathering for salaat (with jamaat) five <br>times daily, has been laid down and in the case of the latter <br>gathering, the weekly Friday salaat has been devised and <br>ordained.\" <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>REPROACH ON GIVING UP JAMAAT <br>Just as Allah has promised rewards and blessings for <br>adhering to His commandments, so has He warned us of <br>the woeful consequences and punishments for their neg- <br>lect. We are in bondage to Allah and as such it is obligatory <br>on us to obey Him. No compensation or reward is due to us <br>for our obedience to Him. If He gives a reward, it is surely a <br>matter of His extreme favour on us. Similarly no punish- <br>ments can be too much for us if we disobey Him-our Lord, <br>for their can be no greater crime for a bondsman than to <br>disobey his Master. Hence no warning or premonition was <br>required to be imparted. Yet Allah and His Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) have so very kindly cautioned <br>us in various ways, warned us frequently of the conse-<br>quences and explained to us again and again, just to save <br>us from disaster. If even then, we don't take a lesson, who <br>collld there be to save us from the inevitable consequences? <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"I <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"If a person in spite of hearing the azaan does not go to <br>the musjid (and he prefers to say his salaat at home) <br>without a strong excuse, then his salaat is not ac-<br>cepted. When the Companions inquired as to what <br>could be a strong excuse, he replied, \"Illness or fear.\" <br>It may perhaps appear from this Hadith that the salaat <br>performed at home (after hearing the Azaan) is no salaat at <br>all; the Hanafiyyah do not hold this view. According to <br>them, though the reward and blessings promised for fardh <br>salaat will not be awarded, yet the person saying the salaat <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus-</p></div>"

And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br>Virtues of Sajaat <br>2. \t<br>These shall be infidels who did not say salaat at all. <br>3. \t These shall be the munaafiqeen.

This, how- <br>ever, is not so bad as to discard salaat altogether, which as <br>we have already learnt, is very serious. Although we are <br>deprived of the rewards by saying a defective salaat, which <br>is not accepted, yet we are saved from the insolence of neg- <br>lecting and disobeying Allah's commandments. However, <br>when we spend our time, leave our work and undergo in- <br>convenience, then why should we not see that we get the <br>best return for our time and labour by saying our salaat as <br>best as we can? <br>This third part is divided into three chapters. In the <br>first chapter, a few quotations from the Holy Qur'an about <br>the people who are condemned for their bad salaat and <br>those who are praised for their good salaat, are given.

But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus- <br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those <br>places (mosques) where the Azaan is said: \"On the day <br>when the glory of Saaq is revealed and they are or- <br>dered to prostrate themselves, but are not able, with <br>eyes downcast, abasement stupifying them. And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br>Virtues of Sajaat <br>2. \t<br>These shall be infidels who did not say salaat at all. <br>3. \t These shall be the munaafiqeen. (Allah knows best and <br>His knowledge is most perfect). <br>What a terrible thing to be so abased and disgraced on <br>the Day of Judgement that, while all Muslims shall fall <br>prostrate at seeing Allah's glory, those who neglected salaat <br>with jamaat shall be singled out by their inability to do so. <br>Besides these, many other warnings have been given <br>against the neglect of jamaat. But as a matter of fact, none is <br>necessary for a good Muslim to whom the word of Allah <br>and His Apostle (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is all import- <br>ant. And for one who has no regard for their word, all such <br>warnings are meaningless. But a time will come when <br>every soul shall be called to account, and punished for its <br>misdeeds, and then no amount of penitence shall be of any <br>avail. <br><br>PART111 <br>IMPORTANCE OF SINCERITY AND DEVOTION IN <br>SALAAT <br>There are many persons who offer their salaat and <br>quite a lot of them are particular about jamaat as well, but <br>they say it so imperfectly that, instead of earning blessings <br>and reward for them, it is rejected forthwith. This, how- <br>ever, is not so bad as to discard salaat altogether, which as <br>we have already learnt, is very serious. Although we are <br>deprived of the rewards by saying a defective salaat, which <br>is not accepted, yet we are saved from the insolence of neg- <br>lecting and disobeying Allah's commandments. However, <br>when we spend our time, leave our work and undergo in- <br>convenience, then why should we not see that we get the <br>best return for our time and labour by saying our salaat as <br>best as we can? <br>This third part is divided into three chapters. In the <br>first chapter, a few quotations from the Holy Qur'an about <br>the people who are condemned for their bad salaat and <br>those who are praised for their good salaat, are given. In the <br>second Chapter, stories about the salaat of a few lovers of <br>Allah are collected. The third chapter consists of the say- <br>ings of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on this <br>subject. <br>CHAPTER I <br>QUOTATIONS FROM THE QUR'AN <br>\"Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah, but devo- <br>tion from you reacheth to Him.\" <br>(XXII:37) <br>Although this particular verse refers to the animal sac- <br>rifice, yet in principle it equally applies to all other rituals. <br>It is sincerity and devotion in a service by which its accept- <br>ance would be judged by Allah. Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice. He replied, 'Be sincere in all your <br>services, as sincerity will magnify the value of an action, <br>however insignificant it may be.\" <br>Hadhrat Thaubaan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Blessed be the sincere ones, for they are the lamps of <br>guidance. They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>ent interpretations: <br>1. To be so careless as to miss the correct time of salaat. <br>2. <br>To be inattentive in salaat. <br>3. To forget the number of rakaats. <br>\"When they (the hypocrites) stand up for salaat, they <br>perform it without earnestness and want but to be seen <br>by men and are mindful of Allah but little.\" <br>(IV: 142) <br>\"Now there hath succeeded them (Prophets) a later <br>generation who have ruined salaat and have followed <br>lusts. So they will meet Ghayy.\" <br>(XIX:59) <br>69 <br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after. According to many commentators, Ghayy is a pit in <br>Hell full of blood and pus. The persons who had ruined <br>their salaat shall be thrown into this pit. <br>Quotation- V<br>I <br>\"And naught preventeth that their (the hypocrites) <br>contributions should be accepted from them, save that <br>they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Apostle, and <br>they come not to worship, save as idlers, and pay3 not <br>i <br>(their contribution) save reluctantly.\" <br>(IV:54) <br>Note: The quotations I to V above relate to those who ruin <br>salaat. On the other hand, the following speak of <br>those whom Allah praises for their good salaat. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>\"Successful indeed are the believers who are humble <br>in their salaat. And who shun vain conversation. And <br>I \t<br>who are payers of the Zakaat. And who abstain from <br>sex, save from their wives or the slaves that their right <br>hand possess, for then they are not blameworthy but <br>who craveth beyond that, such are transgressors-And <br>who faithfully observe their pledges and their cove- <br>nants. And who pav heed to their salaat. These are the <br>heirs who will inherit Firdaus (Paradise). There they <br>will abide.\" <br>(XXIII:1to 11) <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Fir- <br>daus is the apex and the best portion of Paradise, where-</p></div>"

A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the <br>Qur'an' <br>\"He only shall tend Allah's musjid who believes in <br>Allah and the L,ast Day.\" <br>(IV:18).\" <br>The following are a few more ahaadith about the vir- <br>tues of salaat with Jamaat:- <br>1. \t \"Making wudhu when inconvenient, walking to- <br>wards 'the musjid and sitting there (after one <br>salaat), waiting for the next salaat, wipe out the <br>sins.\" <br>2. \t \"The farther a person lives from the 'musjid' the <br>greater the hlessing he receives.\" This is so be- <br>cause a person coming from a distance shall have <br>to walk more and, as already mentioned, every <br>step will fetch him a blessing. For this very reason <br>some companions have been reported to be taking <br>short steps in going to the musjid in order to earn <br>more blessings. <br>3. \t<br>\"There are three things in this world for which <br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>explain the importance of salaat with Jamaat, but their <br>explanations vary with the extent of their understanding <br>and their power to probe into Divine secrets. Our respected <br>Shaikh, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (may Allah illumine his <br>grave), in his famous Book 'Hujjatullahil Balighah' <br>writes:-<br>\"To save the people from the fatal effects that their <br>own customs and rituals can bring them, there is nothing <br>more useful than to make one of the religious services so <br>common a custom and so public a ritual that it may be per- <br>formed openly before everybody by any person, whether he <br>be learned or illiterate. The town-folk and the countrymen <br>should both be equally anxious to observe it. It should <br>become a subject of rivalry and pride among all of them, <br>and ~t should be so universally practised that it becomes <br>part and parcel of their social set-up, so much so, that life <br>without it may be worthless for them. If this is achieved, it <br>will help in establishing the worship and obedience of <br>Allah and will form a very useful substitute for those <br>rituals and customs which could cause them serious harm. <br>Since salaat is the only religious observance that surpasses <br>all others in importance and universality, both in reason <br>and authority, it becomes therefore absolutely necessary to <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>hearts and souls turned to Him alone, have the wonderful <br>effect of causing His blessings and Mercy to descend from <br>Heaven. <br>\"Moreover, the Muslim community has been raised so <br>that the word of Allah be held supreme and Islamic Order <br>be paramount over all others. This object cannot be <br>achieved unless all Muslims, big and small, the elite and <br>the common, the town folk and the countrymen, perform <br>alike the most sublime service and the most sacred ritual of <br>Islam (i.e., salaat) by assembling together in one place. It is <br>for this reason that the Sharee-at (Islamic Law) lays such <br>special stress on Friday congregation and on salaat with <br>jamaat, by explaining the blessings that accrue therefrom <br>and punishments awarded for neglect 1 lereof. For the open <br>and conspicuous observance of this im?ortant service, two <br>types of assemblies are required: one fr~rpeople of a clan or <br>a particular locality and the other for the people of the <br>whole town. Since the assembly or\" the former at any hour <br>is convenient and that of the latte, comparatively difficult, <br>so for the former, the gathering for salaat (with jamaat) five <br>times daily, has been laid down and in the case of the latter <br>gathering, the weekly Friday salaat has been devised and <br>ordained.\" <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>REPROACH ON GIVING UP JAMAAT <br>Just as Allah has promised rewards and blessings for <br>adhering to His commandments, so has He warned us of <br>the woeful consequences and punishments for their neg- <br>lect. We are in bondage to Allah and as such it is obligatory <br>on us to obey Him. No compensation or reward is due to us <br>for our obedience to Him. If He gives a reward, it is surely a <br>matter of His extreme favour on us. Similarly no punish- <br>ments can be too much for us if we disobey Him-our Lord, <br>for their can be no greater crime for a bondsman than to <br>disobey his Master. Hence no warning or premonition was <br>required to be imparted. Yet Allah and His Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) have so very kindly cautioned <br>us in various ways, warned us frequently of the conse-<br>quences and explained to us again and again, just to save <br>us from disaster. If even then, we don't take a lesson, who <br>collld there be to save us from the inevitable consequences? <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"I <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"If a person in spite of hearing the azaan does not go to <br>the musjid (and he prefers to say his salaat at home) <br>without a strong excuse, then his salaat is not ac-<br>cepted. When the Companions inquired as to what <br>could be a strong excuse, he replied, \"Illness or fear.\" <br>It may perhaps appear from this Hadith that the salaat <br>performed at home (after hearing the Azaan) is no salaat at <br>all; the Hanafiyyah do not hold this view. According to <br>them, though the reward and blessings promised for fardh <br>salaat will not be awarded, yet the person saying the salaat <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus- <br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those <br>places (mosques) where the Azaan is said: \"On the day <br>when the glory of Saaq is revealed and they are or- <br>dered to prostrate themselves, but are not able, with <br>eyes downcast, abasement stupifying them. And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br>Virtues of Sajaat <br>2. \t<br>These shall be infidels who did not say salaat at all. <br>3. \t These shall be the munaafiqeen. (Allah knows best and <br>His knowledge is most perfect). <br>What a terrible thing to be so abased and disgraced on <br>the Day of Judgement that, while all Muslims shall fall <br>prostrate at seeing Allah's glory, those who neglected salaat <br>with jamaat shall be singled out by their inability to do so. <br>Besides these, many other warnings have been given <br>against the neglect of jamaat. But as a matter of fact, none is <br>necessary for a good Muslim to whom the word of Allah <br>and His Apostle (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is all import- <br>ant. And for one who has no regard for their word, all such <br>warnings are meaningless. But a time will come when <br>every soul shall be called to account, and punished for its <br>misdeeds, and then no amount of penitence shall be of any <br>avail. <br><br>PART111 <br>IMPORTANCE OF SINCERITY AND DEVOTION IN <br>SALAAT <br>There are many persons who offer their salaat and <br>quite a lot of them are particular about jamaat as well, but <br>they say it so imperfectly that, instead of earning blessings <br>and reward for them, it is rejected forthwith. This, how- <br>ever, is not so bad as to discard salaat altogether, which as <br>we have already learnt, is very serious. Although we are <br>deprived of the rewards by saying a defective salaat, which <br>is not accepted, yet we are saved from the insolence of neg- <br>lecting and disobeying Allah's commandments. However, <br>when we spend our time, leave our work and undergo in- <br>convenience, then why should we not see that we get the <br>best return for our time and labour by saying our salaat as <br>best as we can? <br>This third part is divided into three chapters. In the <br>first chapter, a few quotations from the Holy Qur'an about <br>the people who are condemned for their bad salaat and <br>those who are praised for their good salaat, are given. In the <br>second Chapter, stories about the salaat of a few lovers of <br>Allah are collected. The third chapter consists of the say- <br>ings of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on this <br>subject. <br>CHAPTER I <br>QUOTATIONS FROM THE QUR'AN <br>\"Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah, but devo- <br>tion from you reacheth to Him.\" <br>(XXII:37) <br>Although this particular verse refers to the animal sac- <br>rifice, yet in principle it equally applies to all other rituals. <br>It is sincerity and devotion in a service by which its accept- <br>ance would be judged by Allah. Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice. He replied, 'Be sincere in all your <br>services, as sincerity will magnify the value of an action, <br>however insignificant it may be.\" <br>Hadhrat Thaubaan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Blessed be the sincere ones, for they are the lamps of <br>guidance. They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>ent interpretations: <br>1. To be so careless as to miss the correct time of salaat. <br>2. <br>To be inattentive in salaat. <br>3. To forget the number of rakaats. <br>\"When they (the hypocrites) stand up for salaat, they <br>perform it without earnestness and want but to be seen <br>by men and are mindful of Allah but little.\" <br>(IV: 142) <br>\"Now there hath succeeded them (Prophets) a later <br>generation who have ruined salaat and have followed <br>lusts. So they will meet Ghayy.\" <br>(XIX:59) <br>69 <br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after. According to many commentators, Ghayy is a pit in <br>Hell full of blood and pus. The persons who had ruined <br>their salaat shall be thrown into this pit. <br>Quotation- V<br>I <br>\"And naught preventeth that their (the hypocrites) <br>contributions should be accepted from them, save that <br>they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Apostle, and <br>they come not to worship, save as idlers, and pay3 not <br>i <br>(their contribution) save reluctantly.\" <br>(IV:54) <br>Note: The quotations I to V above relate to those who ruin <br>salaat. On the other hand, the following speak of <br>those whom Allah praises for their good salaat. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>\"Successful indeed are the believers who are humble <br>in their salaat. And who shun vain conversation. And <br>I \t<br>who are payers of the Zakaat. And who abstain from <br>sex, save from their wives or the slaves that their right <br>hand possess, for then they are not blameworthy but <br>who craveth beyond that, such are transgressors-And <br>who faithfully observe their pledges and their cove- <br>nants. And who pav heed to their salaat. These are the <br>heirs who will inherit Firdaus (Paradise). There they <br>will abide.\" <br>(XXIII:1to 11) <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Fir- <br>daus is the apex and the best portion of Paradise, where-</p></div>"

So much so that even Salaat, <br>which is the most important pillar of Islam (after Imaan) <br>and the first and the foremost thing to be reckoned on the <br>Day of Judgement, is being badly neglected. Although every <br>call to 'Islam', nowadays, seems to be only a cry in the wil- <br>derness, yet experience shows that efforts in this direction <br>are not altogether fruitless. The glorious words of the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) are sure to benefit <br>those with a receptive and submissive frame of mind. With <br>this idea in view and to comply with the long-standing re- <br>quest of some of my dear friends, I have taken upon myself <br>to write this booklet, which is the second of the series on <br>'Tabligh', the first one being \"Virtues of Tabligh.\" <br>And my success can only come from Allah! And in <br>Him I trust and unto Him I turn .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . (XI:88) <br><br>I<br>I <br>I <br>1i <br>i <br>I <br>i<br>L <br>II<br>FOREWORD <br>The present-day Muslims, in respect of their behaviour <br>towards Salaat, can be divided into three groups. A large <br>number among them is totally unmindful of Salaat. Quite a <br>few observe their Salaat, but are not particular about <br>Jamaat. Then there are those who are regular in their Salaat <br>(with Jamaat), but their Salaat is devoid of the care and <br>thoroughness which it demands. I have divided the book <br>into three parts to suit the requirements of each group. In <br>each part, the illustrious Ahaadith of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) are quoted with their simple ig<br>translation. The translation is idiomatic and not literal. Ex-<br>planatory notes have been added wherever necessary. The <br>names of the books of Hadith from which the quotatims <br>are taken have also been mentioned for reference. <br><br>PART I <br>IMPORTANCE OF SALAAT <br>There are two Chapters in this <br>The first one is or1 '1111- <br>portance of salaat, and the second of 'Warning and Re- <br>proach' for those who neglect or discard salaat. <br><br>CHAPTER 1 <br>THE REWARDS OF SALAAT <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Kadhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: <br>\"Islan~ is founded on five pillars: bearing witness that <br>there is no god but Allah, and Muhanlmad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is His servant and apostle: estahlishmerlt <br>of salaat: paying of Zakaat; pertorrnance of Hajj: axri fastirig <br>in Kamadhaan.\" <br>The Prophe! (Sallallaho alaihe u~asallam) has com-<br>pared Islam to a canopy resting on five supports. The Kali- <br>mah is the central support and the other four pillars of <br>Islam are. so to say, the remaining four supports. one at <br>each corner of the canopy. Without the central support, the <br>canopy cannot possibly stand. and if any one of the corner <br>supports is missing a collapse will result in the defective <br>corner. Now, let us judge for ourselves how far we have <br>kept up the canopv of Islam. Is there really any pillar that <br>is being held in its proper place? <br>L <br>The five pillars of Islam mentioned in this Hadith sig- <br>nifv the most essential duties of a Muslim. Although a <br>hluslim cannot do without any one of them, vet salaat in <br>Isldrn ctccupies a position next onlv to Ilnaan. Hadhrat Ab-<br>dullah bin Mas'ood (Kadhi~allaho <br>anho) savs: <br>\"Once, I inquired of tht: tioly Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), which act (of man) was the dearest to <br>Allah. The Prophet replied, 'saiaat'. I then inquired which <br>act came next (in order of merit) and the Prophet replied, <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>'Kindness to parents'. I again asked what was next and he <br>answered 'Jihaad'.\" <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted this <br>Hadith in support of the belief that salaat is the most inl- <br>portant religious duty after Imaan. This is further corrobo- <br>rated by a hadith, in which the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the best of all that has been ordained by <br>Allah.\" <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>out of his house. It was autumn and the leaves were falling <br>off the trees. He caught hold of a branch of a tree and its <br>leaves began to drop in large number. At this he remarked, <br>'0,Abu Zar! (Radhiyallaho anho) when a Muslim offers his <br>salaat to please Allah, his sins are shed awav from him just <br>as these leaves are falling off this tree.\" <br>In autumn, usually, the leaves of the trees fall in large <br>numbers, so much so that on some trees not a single leaf is <br>left behind. The same is the effect of salaat performed with <br>sincerity and devotion. All the sins of the person offering <br>salaat are wiped off. It should, however, be remembered <br>that according to the verdict of the theologians, it is only <br>the saghaa'ir (minor sins) that are forgiven by the perform- <br>ance of salaat and other services. The kabaa'ir (major sins) <br>are r,ot pardoned without repentance. We should, there- <br>fore, in addition to saying salaat, be particular about doing <br>taubah (repentance) and istighfaar (seeking forgiveness). <br>AHah may, however, pardon, by His bountiful Grace, even <br>the kabaa'ir of any person because of his salaat. <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Abu Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"I was <br>once sitting under a tree with Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyal- <br>!ah0 anho). He caught hold of a dry branch of the tree and <br>shook it till all its leaves fell off. He then said to me, \"0, <br>Abu Uthman! (Radhiyallaho anho) Will you not ask me <br>why I am doing this?\" \"Do tell me,\" I entreated. He said, <br>\"The Apostle of Allah had done exactly like this before me, <br>while I was with him under a tree. He caught a dry branch <br>of it and shook it, till all its leaves fell off\". At this he said: <br>'0, Salmaan! (Radhiyallaho anho) will you not ask me why <br>I am doing this?' I replied: 'Do tell me why you are doing <br>this?' He remarked: \"Verily when a Muslim takes wudhu <br>properly and then observes his salaat five times a day, his <br>sins fall off just as these leaves have fallen off. He then re- <br>cited the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>\"Establish salaat at the two ends of the day, and at the <br>approaches of the night. Verily, good deeds annul ill <br>deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. (XI: 114)\" <br>The behaviour of Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in the above hadith displays the profound love <br>which the Sahabah had for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>wasallam). They would often cherish the sweet memories <br>of the time when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was living among them. They would, while quoting him, <br>enact exactly what they had seen him doing at a particular <br>moment. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the traditions of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which deal <br>with the importance of salaat and which declare forgive- <br>ness for those who guard it. As had already been said <br>before, the theologians restrict this declaration of forgive- <br>ness to saghaa'ir (minor sins) only, but in the text of the <br>hadith there is no such restriction. My learned father gave <br>me two reasons for this. Firstly, it does not really become a <br>Muslim to commit any of the kabaa'ir (major sins). If per- <br>chance any such sins are committed by him, he cannot rest <br>in peace (due to inherent fear of Allah in him) until he <br>washes them with his tears of repentance in crying before <br>Allah. Secondly, the person who performs his salaat with <br>sincerity and thoroughness is very likely to do istighfaar <br>quite a number of times daily. Look for instance at the clos- <br>ing prayer of salaat itself, viz: <br>\"0,My Lord! I have wronged my soul a great wrong, <br>and none forgiveth sins save Thou alone. Then forgive <br>me and have mercy on me. Verily, Thou art the For- <br>giving, the Merciful.\" <br>In the above hadith, mention is made of wudhu to be <br>done properlv. We should, therefore, be sure of the regu- <br>lations about wudhu and try to observe all of these. For <br>example. take the case of miswaak. It is sunnat of wudhu, <br>but is very often neglected. It is said in a hadith that the <br>salaat offered after doing ~nisivaak is seventy times superior <br>to the salaat ~ ~ i t h o u t  <br>miswaak. In another hadith, use of <br>misuraak has been enjoined verv stronglv, and the follo~v- <br>irig benefits are attributed to it:- <br>\"It cleanses and sweetens the mouth and checks its <br>bad smell.\" <br>\"It is a cause of Allah's pleasure and a blow to the <br>Ilevil.\" <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Saiaat <br>\"Allah and his angels love the person doing miswaak.\" <br>\"It strengthens the gums and improves eye-sight.\" <br>\"It is a purge against bile and phlegm.\" <br>To crown all, \"It is a sunnah i.e. the practice of our be- <br>loved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>As many as seventy virtues of the n~iswaak have been <br>enumerated by the theologians. It is said that a person in <br>the habit of miswaak dies with the Kalimah on his lips. <br>The rewards of taking wudhu properly are very many. It is <br>mentioned in ahaadith that the parts of body washed in <br>wudhu shall glitter on the Day of Judgement and, by this <br>(distinction), the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will <br>at once recognise his followers. <br>Hadith.-IV(a) <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>asked his companions, 'Do you believe that dirt can <br>remain on a person bathing five times a day in a brook <br>running in front of his door?' 'No', replied the compan- <br>ions, 'No dirt can remain on his body.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'So, exactly <br>similar is the effect of salaat offered five times a day. <br>With the Grace of Allah. it washes away all the sins'.\" <br>Hadith.-IV(b) <br>\"Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>\"The likeness of five times daily salaat is as the like- <br>ness of a deep brook running in front of the door of a <br>person who bathes therein five times a day.\" <br>Running water is generally free from dirt, and the <br>deeper it runs the cleaner and purer it is. A bath in such <br>water surely removes dirt from the body and makes it <br>clean. Salaat offered with due regard for its essentials like- <br>wise cleanses the soul of all sins. There are several ahaa- <br>dith of the same meaning, though with slight variations in <br>expression, narrate& by different companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed <br>Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>'Each of the five salaats expiates the sins committed <br>since the salaat preceding it. To explain. let us take the <br>case of a person working in a factory. His job is such <br>that his body gets covered with dust. But there are five <br>streams of running water in between the factory and <br>his house and, on his return from the job, he takes a <br>bath in each stream. The effect of five times daily <br>salaat is quite similar. Any sins of omission and com- <br>mission between two salaats are forgiven on account of <br>'istighfaar and taubah in each salaat.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) through such <br>parables, aims at impressing that salaat has the wonderful <br>power of removing the sins. If we fail to avail of Allah's <br>mercy, surely we ourselves are the losers. <br>To err is human. We are likely to commit innumerable <br>acts of displeasing Allah and deserve thereby. His wrath <br>and punishment, but look how relenting our dear Allah is! <br>He has most graciously shown us the way to earn His <br>mercy and forgiveness. It is a great pity if we do not avail of <br>this great favour. Our Allah is always eager to show us His <br>mercy on very small grounds. It is said in a hadith, that if a <br>person goes to bed with the intention of getting up for Ta- <br>hajjud and perchance does not wake up, he receives the <br>full reward for Tahajjud, although he has been enjoying his <br>sleep at the time of Tahajjud. How boundless is the grace of <br>Allah and what a tremendous loss and deprivation if we do <br>not receive blessings from such a Giver. <br><br>i <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>\"Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that, <br>wvenever the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>h ppened to face any difficulty, he would at once <br>r9sort to salaat.\" <br>0,<br>vr B <br>P d  <br>Salaat is a great blessing of Allah. To resort to salaat at <br>the time of worry is to hasten towards His mercy, and <br>when Allah's mercy comes to rescue, there can remain no <br>trace of any worry. There are many traditions concerning <br>this practice of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Similar was the practice of his companions, who fol- <br>lowed him in the minutest detail. Hadhrat Abu Darda <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Whenever a strong wind blew, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would immedi- <br>ately enter the musjid and would not leave until the wind <br>had subsided. Similarly, at the time of a solar or lunar <br>eclipse, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would at <br>I \t<br>once start offering salaat. Hadhrat Suhaib (Radhiyallaho <br>I \t<br>anho) was informed by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that all the previous Apostles of Allah (peace be <br>upon them) also used to resort to salaat in all adversities. <br>Hadhrat Ibno Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was once on <br>journey. On his way he got the news of the death of his <br>I \t<br>son. He got down from his camel and offered two rakaat of <br>salaat, praying in Tashahhud for a long time. He then re- <br>cited 'Innaa liliaahi wa innaallaihi raaji-oon' and said, \"I <br>have done what Allah has ordered us to do in His Holy <br>Book i.e.: <br>!p\\j+I*\\, <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat\" (11: 45). <br>Another similar story is narrated about him. He was on <br>a journey when he received the news about the death of his <br>brother Quthum. He descended from his camel by the road- <br>side, and performed two rakaats of salaat and kept praying <br>in Tashahhud for a long time. After finishing his salaat, he <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>rode his camel reciting the following verse of the Holy <br>Qur'an: <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat, and truly <br>it is indeed hard except to the humble minded.\" <br>(11:45). <br>There is yet another story about him. On hearing of the <br>death of a wife of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), he fell down prostrate. When somebody asked him <br>the reason he said, \"Our dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had enjoined on us to prostrate (in salaat) when- <br>ever a calamity were to befall us. What calamity can be <br>greater than the death of the Ummul-Mo'mineen?\" <br>When Hadhrat Ubaada (Radhiyallaho anho) was about <br>to breathe his last, he said to the people around him, \"I <br>prohibit one and all from crying over me. When my soul <br>departs, I ask every one to perform wudhu, observing all its <br>essentials, and to go to the musjid and pray for my forgive- <br>ness, because our Gracious Allah has enjoined on us to <br>\"Seek help with patience and salaat.\" After that, lay me <br>down in the pit of my grave.\" <br>Hadhrat Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"Once it <br>became very dark during the day in Madina. I hurriedly <br>went to Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) to know if he <br>had ever experienced similar conditions during the life- <br>time of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He <br>said to me. \"M'aathallaah! During those blessed days, <br>whenever the wind blew strong, we would hurry to the <br>musjid lest it should be the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Salaam (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that whenever the members of the Prophet's family <br>were hardpressed in any way, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would enjoin upon then1 to say salaat, <br>and would recite the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be thyself <br>constant therein. We ask not of thee to provide suste- <br>nance. We provide it for thee. And the Hereafter is for <br>the righteousness.\" <br>(XX: 132). <br>It is said in a hadith that when somebody is confronted <br>with a need, whether pertaining to this life or the Hereafter, <br>or whether it concerns Allah or a mortal, he should per- <br>form a perfect wudhu, offer salaat of two rakaats, glorify <br>Allah, then ask blessing for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and then pray as under: <br>0,<br>k\", m <br>\"There is no god save Allah-the Clement-the Bouqti-<br>ful. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the tremendous <br>throne. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I ask <br>Thee all that leadeth to Thy Mercy and deserveth Thy <br>forgiveness. I ask Thee abundance in all that is good <br>and refuge from all that is evil. Leave me no sin but <br>Thou pardonest it, and no distress but Thou removest <br>it, and no need but Thou fulfillest it. 0,most Merciful <br>of those who show mercy!\" <br>Wahb bin Munabbih writes: \"Have your needs fulfilled <br>by Allah through salaat. In the good old time, if a calamity <br>befell the people, they would hurry towards salaat.\" It is <br>said that in Koofah there was a porter who was well known <br>for his honesty. People trusted him with their valuables <br>and money, which he carried from one place to another. <br>Once he wps on his usual errand when a person-met him <br>on the wayland asked him about his destination. When the <br>porter gave him the required information, k s a i d ,  \"I am <br>also bound for the same destination. If I could walk, I <br>would have accompanied you on foot. Will you kindly give <br>me a lift on your mule for one dinaar?\" The porter agreed <br>and allowed him to share the mule with him. They came to <br>a crossing on the way. The person said, 'Now, which road <br>will you take?' 'The main road, of course,' replied the <br>porter. The person said, 'No, brother. We should go by the <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>other road which is a shortcut and there is plenty of grass <br>enroute to feed the animal.' The porter said, 'I have never <br>been on this path.' The person remarked, 'But I have travel- <br>led by this route quite often'. The porter believed him and <br>put the animal on that path. After some distance, the path <br>ended in a terrifying forest where a large number of dead <br>bodies were lying about. All of a sudden the person <br>jumped down from the mule and took out his knife with <br>the intention of slaying the porter. 'Hold your hand', <br>shouted the porter, 'Take the animal and its load, but do <br>not kill me'. The person refused to listen to his entreaty <br>and swore that he would first kill the porter and then take <br>possession of the animal and the goads. Seeing that his en- <br>treaties fell on deaf ears and that his cruel heart would not <br>melt, the porter said to him, 'All right if you must kill me, <br>then permit to say my salaat of only two rakaats.' The <br>person agreed and remarked, 'You can please yourself. All <br>the dead you see over here made the same request, but <br>their salaat was of no avail to them.' The porter started the <br>salaat, but could not recollect any soorah to connect with <br>the Fatihah, in spite of his best efforts. Meanwhile the <br>person grew impatient and pressed him hard to hurry up <br>with the salaat. All of a sudden the following verse flashed <br>to his mind: <br>'Is it not He Who answereth the wronged one when he <br>crieth unto Him, and removeth the evil. .. (XXVII-62). <br>The porter was reciting the verse and the tears welled <br>up in his eyes, when a horseman suddenly appeared on the <br>scene. He was wearing a glittering helmet and held a spear <br>in his hand. He pierced the body of the pitiless rogue with <br>his spear and killed him there and then. A flame of fire <br>rose from the spot where the dead body fell. The porter fell <br>down prostrate and thanked Allah. After finishing his <br>salaat, he ran towards the horseman and requested him to <br>disclose his identity. He replied, 'I am a slave to Him who <br>answereth the wronged one. You are now safe and can go <br>wherever you like.' Saying this, the horseman rode away <br>and disappeared. \" <br>Indeed salaat is a tremendous asset. Besides pleasing <br>Allah it often gets us deliverence from the calamities of this <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>life and provides us with tranquility and eace of mind. <br>Ibn Seereen writes: \"If I be allowed to c Eoose between <br>Paradise and salaat of two rakaats, I would prefer salaat. <br>The reason is quite clear. Paradise is for my own pleasure <br>while salaat is for the pleasure of my dear Lord.\" The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: \"Enviable is <br>the lot of that Muslim who is with least encumbrance, <br>whose main fortune is salaat, who remains content with <br>humble provision throughout his life, who worshi s his <br>Lord in a dutiful manner, who lives a nameless li e and <br>P<br>who dies an early death, with very little to bequeath and <br>very few to mourn him.\" In another hadith, the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said: 'Offer your salaat at your homes quite frequently, so <br>that these may be blessed with Allah's Grace and Mercy.\" <br>\"Abu Muslim narrates: I went to see Abu Umaamah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) while he was in the musjid. I <br>asked him if he had really heard the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"When a person per- <br>forms wudhu with right performance and then says his <br>fardh salaat, Allah forgives him all the sins committed <br>that day by his feet in going towards evil, by his hands <br>in doing evil, by his ears in listening to evil, by his <br>eyes in looking at evil and by his heart in thinking of <br>evil.' He replied, 'By Allah, I have heard these words <br>from the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>again and again.\" <br>Many of the companions have narrated this Hadith <br>with slight variations. Those endowed with the power of <br>Kashf can even witness the sins being shed. It is said of <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Imam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) that he could tell <br>from the water falling down from the limbs of the person <br>performing wudhu as to which sins had been washed off <br>therewith. In a narration by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have warned against being wrong-headed in com- <br>mitting sins in the hope of getting them redeemed through <br>salaat. We have, really, no ground to behave as such on <br>this account. After all, what is the quality of the salaat that <br>we offer? If Allah merely absolves us of our obligation it is <br>His very special favour and grace. Again it is the height of <br>ingratitude to disobey Allah just because He is Clement, <br>Merciful and Forgiving. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"Two persons of one clan came to Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and embraced Islam at one and the <br>same time. One of these was martyred in a battle and <br>the other died a year later, Hadhrat Talha bin Ubaidul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he saw in his dream <br>that the person who had died later was admitted into <br>Paradise before the martyr. This surprised him. I do <br>not recollect whether it was he or somebody else who <br>narrated this dream. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thereupon remarked: \"Has not the person <br>dying later fasted for one additional month of Rama- <br>dhaan, and has he not offered six thousand or odd ra- <br>kaats of salaat more during the year he lived after the <br>martyr?\" <br>Really, we do not know how valuable salaat is! The <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was often heard <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>2 3 <br>saying, \"The comfort of my eyes is in salaat.\" This is an ex- <br>pression of his profound love for salaat. As such, what else <br>can be more valuable than salaat? <br>Hadith.VII1 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"At the approach of the hour of a salaat, an <br>Angel is deputed to proclaim, 'Arise, 0 Children of <br>Aadam! and extinguish the fire that you have (by com- <br>mitting sins) kindled to burn yourselves. So, the <br>people rise up, perform wudhu and offer their Zuhr <br>prayer. This causes forgiveness of their sins committed <br>since day-break. The same is repeated at Asr, Maghrib <br>and Ishaa. After Ishaa people go to bed, but there are <br>some who busy themselves in good, while some others <br>in evil deeds. <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"After <br>Ishaa the people get divided into three groups. There are <br>some for whom the night is a source of blessing and gain. <br>They are those who spend it in the worship of Allah, while <br>other people are asleep. For them the night brings great <br>reward from their Lord. There are others who turn their <br>night into a burden and curse for themselves, for they in- <br>dulge in various dark deeds in the dead of night. To them <br>the night brings woe and misery. There is the third group <br>of people who go to bed immediately after Ishaa; they <br>neither gain nor lose.\" <br>Hadith.1X <br>djG 5, JG <br>I j&; j G  JG <br>A, &j gj$ hij &i2 <br>O<br>,<br> <br>,J+<br>3. ai <br>..A@, +,& <br>&i 3 b$,J&, <br>*+<br>>f! <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Hadbrat Abu Qataadah bin Rab'iyy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"He heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, Allah has said, \"0, Muhammad! I <br>have ordained five times daily salaat for thy followers. <br>I have made a covenant with myself that whosoever is <br>regular in performing his salaat at its fixed hour, he <br>shall be admitted into the Paradise. Those of thy fol- <br>lowers who do not guard their salaat, are not included <br>in this covenant.\" <br>In another hadith, it is said that Allah has ordained <br>five times salaat and whosoever is mindful of his salaat, by <br>doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with <br>sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah of his entry into <br>Paradise; and whosoever does not guard his salaat, there is <br>no such guarantee for him; he may-or may not be forgiven. <br>salaat has indeed a tremendous value. It affords us an op- <br>portunity to 'receive Allah's guarantee for Paradise. When <br>an honourable person of some financial standing or having <br>executive power gives us a guarantee or stands surety for <br>meeting any of our requirements of this world, we feel <br>quite satisfied and happy and we consider it our duty to <br>remain obliged and devoted to him. Here Allah the Abso- <br>lute Sovereign of both the worlds, is giving the guarantee <br>and is standing surety for the real success after death in <br>return for five times daily salaat, which does not involve <br>much effort on our part. If even then we do not avail of the <br>opportunity, we shall have none to blame, but ourselves for <br>the dreadful doom that awaits us. <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Ibn Salmaan says that he heard one of the companions <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) nar- <br>rating, \"When we had won the battle of Khaibar, we <br>began to buy and sell among ourselves the booty that <br>had fallen to our lot. One of us went to Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, '0, Apostle of <br>Allah, no one else has earned so much profit as I have <br>obtained in today's trade.' 'How much did you earn? <br>asked the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He re- <br>plied, 'I kept on selling and buying till I earned a net <br>profit of three hundred 'Ooqiyyah' of silver.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I <br>inform you of something better than that?\" He ex-<br>claimed, 'Do tell me, 0,Prophet of Allah!' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked 'Two rakaats <br>nafl after (fardh) salaat.\" <br>Three hundred Ooqiyyahs of silver come to about three <br>thousand rupees. According to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), the perishable gain of this world stands <br>no comparison with the everlasting gain of the Hereafter. <br>Our life will be pleasant and worth living if we develop our <br>'Imaan' to an extent where two rakaats of salaat, in our <br>sight, are more valuable than all the riches of this world. <br>salaat is really a great treasure and that is why the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of <br>his eyes' and had been enjoining its observance right up to <br>his last breath. Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that the last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), which he could hardly utter, were about guard- <br>ing the salaat and kindness towards the slaves. There is a <br>similar hadith narrated by Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>as well. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once deputed <br>in Jihaad a Jamaat towards Najd. They returned victorious <br>very soon with a handsome booty. When the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saw the people envying them and <br>wondering at their quick and lucrative return, he said to <br>them, \"Shall I inform you of a group of people who earn <br>much more in a much shorter time? They are those who <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>perform their Fajr with Jamaat and keep sitting after prayer <br>till a little while after sunrise and then offer two rakaats of <br>salaat.\" According to Shaqeeq Balkhi, a very famous <br>Shaikh, five things could be acquired through five chan- <br>nels; an increase in provisions through 'Chaasht' a light in <br>the grave through Tahajjud, a very satisfactory answer to <br>Munkar and Nakeer through the recitation of the Qur'an; an <br>easy crossing of Siraat through fasting and alms, and room <br>under the shade of Allah's Throne on the Day of Judgement <br>through seclusion (i.e. Zikr). <br>There are so many sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) enjoining salaat and explaining its <br>virtues that it is very difficult to cover all of them in this <br>small book. A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in <br>the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in the matter of <br>salaat!. <br>3. \t \"SalCat intervenes between man and Shirk.\" <br>4.\t \"Salaat is the mark of Islam. A person who says <br>his salaat at the fixed hours with sincerity and de- <br>votion, observing all its regulations including the <br>Mustahabbaat, is surely a Mo'min.\" <br>5. \t \"Of all things that have been ordained by Allah, <br>Imaan and salaat are the most valued. If there were <br>any otber thing better than salaat, then Allah <br>would have ordained it for His Angels, some of <br>whom are always in ruku and others in sajdah.\" <br>6. \t \"Salaat is the pillar of Islam.\" <br>7. \t \"Salaat abases the Devil.\" <br>8. \t \"Salaat is the light of a Mo'min.\" <br>9. \"Salaat is the best Jihaad.\" <br>10. \t \"Allah keeps relenting towards a person so long as <br>he is engaged in salaat.\" <br>11. \"When a calamity befalls us from the heaven, <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>people frequenting the musjid are spared and <br>saved.\" <br>12. \t \"If some major sins of a Muslim land him in Hell, <br>the fire would not burn those parts of his body <br>which have touched the ground while he was in <br>sajdah during his salaat.\" <br>13. \t \"Fire has been forbidden to touch those parts of <br>the body which touch the ground while perform- <br>ing the sajdah.\" <br>% <br>14. \"Of all the practices, salaat made at fixed hours is 8 <br>5<br>most loved by Allah.\" \t<br>.-<br>L V ~<br>> <br>15. \"Allah likes most the posture of a person when he <br>is in sajdah, pressing his forehead on the ground <br>in humility.\" <br>16. \"A person in sajdah is nearest unto Allah.\" <br>17. \"Sa1aa.t is a key to Paradise.\" <br>18. \"When a person stands in salaat the gates of Par- <br>adise are let open and all the veils between him <br>and Allah are lifted (provided that he spoils not <br>his salaat by coughing etc).\" <br>19. \"A person in salaat (so to say) knocks at the door <br>of the sovereign Lord, and the door is always <br>opened for him who knocks.\" <br>20. \t \"The position of salaat in Islam is as the position <br>of the head in a body.\" <br>21. \t \"Salaat is the light of the heart. Let those who <br>wish enlighten their hearts (through salaat)\". <br>22. \"If \t a person wishes to have his sins forgiven by <br>Allah, he should perform the wudhu properly, <br>offer with devotion two or four rak'aats of fardh or <br>nafl and then pray to Allah. Allah will forgive <br>him.\" <br>23. \t \"Any strip of earth, on which Allah is remem-<br>bered in salaat, takes pride over the rest of the <br>Earth.\" <br>24. \"Allah accepts the prayer of a person who prays to <br>Him after performing two rakaats of salaat. Allah <br>grants him what he prays for, sometimes immedi- <br>ately and sometimes (in his own interest) later.\" <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>25. \t \"A person who performs two rakaats of salaat in <br>seclusion, where nobody except Allah and His <br>Angels see him, receives a writ of deliverance <br>from the fire of hell.\" <br>26. \t \"Grant of one prayer (wish) becomes due to a <br>person from Allah after each fardh salaat per-<br>formed by him.\" <br>27. \t \"Fire of Hell is forbidden and the Paradise be- <br>comes due to a person who performs his wudhu <br>properly and says his salaat conscientiously, <br>according to its regulations.\" \t<br>28. \t \"The Devil remains scared of a Muslim so long as <br>he is particular about his salaat, but no sooner <br>does he neglect it than the Devil gets a hold upon <br>him and aspires for success in seducing him.\" <br>29. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is the most excellent <br>practice.\" <br>30. \t \"Salaat is the offering of the pious.\" <br>31. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is a practice most liked <br>by Allah.\" \t<br>32. \t \"At dawn, some people go to the musjid and some <br>to the market.

Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the <br>comfort of his eyes and used to spend the major part of the <br>night standing before Allah. For the very same reason, our <br>dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even on his<br>death-bed charged us and enjoined on us to be particular <br>about salaat. It has been reported in many ahaadith that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often say, <br>\"Fear Allah concerning salaat.\" Abdullah bin Mas'ood, <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"Of all the practices, <br>salaat is the dearest to me.\" <br>One of the Sahabah narrates, \"One night I happened to <br>go to the musjid. I found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) in salaat. I felt an ardent desire to join him. I made <br>I <br>my intention and stood behind him; he was reciting 'Baqa- <br>rah' at that time. I thought that he would finish the qiraat <br>and go for ruku at the end of the hundredth verse, but he <br>did not do so. Then I thought he would perhaps go to ruku <br>after finishing two hundred verses, but he did not stop <br>even there. I was sure then that he would finish qiyaam <br>with the end of the soorah. When the soorah ended he <br>hymned, 'Allahumma Lakalhamd' (Allah! Thine is all <br>Glory) a number of times and then started 'Aal Imraan'. On <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak, the famous Soofi, writes, <br>\"My neighbour at Koofah had a son. The boy fasted during <br>the day and kept praying and hymning during the night. <br>This constant strain emaciated him so much that his body <br>was reduced to a skeleton. His father requested me to ad- <br>monish him. Once I was sitting at my door when the boy <br>passed by. He greeted me with 'Assalaamu alaikum' and sat <br>down. I had hardly said anything when he interrupted <br>saying, 'Dear Uncle! Maybe you intend to admonish me to <br>reduce my pursuits. Listen to my story first. I had a few <br>friends in the locality. We decided among ourselves to vie <br>with one another in worship and adoration of Allah. They <br>all applied themselves so hard that they were soon sent for <br>by Allah. They embraced death delightedly and peacefully. <br>Now I am the only one left behind. What will they think of <br>me when they know of my lagging behind? Dear Uncle! My <br>friends really strived very hard and achieved their goal,' He <br>then began to relate the pursuits and accomplishments of <br>his departed friends, which astonished all the listeners. <br>After this he left me. I heard a few days later that the boy <br>too had died (May Allah bless him).\" <br>Even in these days there are persons who remain en- <br>gaged in salaat for the major portion of the night and <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat <br>Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I love most <br>are: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and reciting the <br>Qur'an.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). \"And I love the three things most: serving a guest, <br>fasting on a very hot day and smiting the enemy with my <br>sword.\" At this, Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) appeared on the <br>scene and said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Allah has sent me to tell you what I would love if I be one <br>of the mortals.\" \"Yes, do tell us, Jibra-eel\", said the <br>Prophet. jibra-eel then replied, \"If I had been like you, I <br>would have loved three things: guiding the people gone <br>astray, loving those who worship in poverty and helping <br>the poor family men. And as for Allah, He loves three <br>I \t<br>characteristics of His slaves: striving in His Path, crying at <br>the time of repentance, and steadfastness in want and <br>hunger.\" <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim writes: 'Salaat ensures daily bread, <br>promotes health, drives out diseases, strengthens the heart, <br>brings light and beauty on the face, pleases the soul, re- <br>freshes the body, cures indolence, relieves the mind, feeds <br>the soul, illumines the heart and guarantees Allah's favour. <br>It grants protection against Allah's Doom. It keeps the Devil <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>WARNING AND REPROACH FOR NEGLECTING <br>SALAAT <br>The books on hadith mention very severe punishment <br>for those who neglect salaat. From many traditions on the <br>s,ubject, only a few are reproduced in this chapter. <br>Although a single warning from the most truthful Prophet <br>3E j,<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was enough, yet we find that, grn<br>out of love and mercy for his followers, he has cautioned <br>them again and again and in various manners lest they <br>should neglect salaat and suffer the consequences. In spite <br>of all this, alas! we are unmindful of salaat, and still we <br>have the audacity to consider ourselves devotees of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and champions of <br>Islam. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>1. \t \"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr and <br>Shirk.\" <br>3. \t \"Discarding of salaat is the only partition between <br>Imaan and Kufr.\" <br>There are a number of ahaadith on the subject. On one <br>occasion, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said: \"Hurry up with your salaat when it <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us! <br>Hadhrat IJbaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates. 'My. dear friend the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) while enjoining upon me seven good prac- <br>tices said, \"Do not ascribe anything as partner to Allah, <br>though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not forego salaat intentionally, lest you <br>should get out of the fold of Islam; do not perpetrate <br>disobedience of Allah, lest you deserve His wrath; and <br>do not take to drinking, for that is the mother of all <br>evils'.\" <br>In another hadith, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"My dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>warned me saying, 'Do not ascribe anything as partner unto <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar-<br>rates: \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined upon me ten things, viz, 'Do not ascribe <br>anything as partner unto Allah, though you may be <br>slain or burnt alive; do not disobey your parents. <br>though you may have to part with your wife or your <br>entire wealth; do not neglect fardh salaat, intention- <br>ally, for Allah is free from obligation to a person who <br>neglects fardh salaat intentionally; do not take wine, <br>for it is an evil habit; that is the root of every uice; do <br>not commit disobedience of Allah, for that brings the <br>wrath of Allah. Do not turn your back to the enemy in <br>battle, though all your comrades may have fallen. Do <br>not fly from the locality where an epidemic has broken <br>out. Do spend on your family members according to <br>your capacity; let your rod be hanging on them, as a <br>warning and to chastise against neglect of their duties <br>towards Allah.\" <br>According to this hadith, we should not spare the roci <br>in checking the children from becoming reckless ih doing <br>anything they like. Sometimes it is necessary to use the <br>rod. It is a pity that out of love we do not use the rod in the <br>beginning and, when the children get spoilt, we cry and <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\" <br>Hadhrat Naufil bin Mu'aawiyah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"A person who has missed one <br>salaat is like one who has lost all his family and <br>wealth.\" <br>Salaat is missed usually when either a person is in the <br>company of his family members or is in pursuit of money. <br>According to this hadith, the ultimate loss sustained in <br>missing a salaat is in no way less than the loss of the whole <br>family and property. In other words, if we miss a salaat we <br>should be as much grieved as when we lose all of our folk <br>and entire belongings. If we are cautioned by some reliable <br>person about the presence of gangsters on a certain road, <br>where people are robbed and killed during the night, we <br>need a lion's heart to ignore the caution and travel on that <br>road even during the day time. Strange enough to note that <br><br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>themselves as practical Muslims perform a number of their <br>salaats in combination on returning home, on the very <br>feeble excuses of travel, trade or occupation. To put salaat <br>off till after its set time without a strong excuse (illness, <br>etc) is a major sin. Although it is not so disastrous as neg- <br>lecting salaat, yet it is quite serious. <br>Hadith VI <br>Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while <br>talking about salaat said: \"For its votary, salaat \"shall on <br>the Day of Judgement, be a light for him, an argument <br>in his favour, and a means of his deliverance. Whereas <br>there will be no light, no defence and no deliverance <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from doom for him who does not guard his salaat, and <br>he shall meet the fate of Pharoah, Haamaan and Ubbay <br>bin Khalaf.\" <br>Everybody knows that Pharoah-the big disbeliever-- <br>had been so arrogant that he proclaimed himself 'Lord the <br>Highest' and made his people worship him. Haamaan was <br>his Chief Minister and accomplice. Ubbay bin Khalaf was <br>the most active and severest enemy of Islam among the dis- <br>believers of Mecaa. Before the Hijrah, he used to announce <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) most insolently, <br>\"I have reared a horse, which I feed very well; I will slay <br>you one day riding on its back.\" Once the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied to him, \"Inshaa-allaah! you <br>shall meet your end at my hands.\" In the battle of Uhud, he <br>ran about in the field in search of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is not slain today, then I stand no chance of sur- <br>viving.\" He at last found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and advanced to attack him. The Companions <br>decided to finish him before he reached the Prophet, but <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stopped them. <br>When he came near, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) took a spear from one of the companions and struck <br>him with it, causing a little scratch on his neck. He stag- <br>gered and fell down from his horse and then fled towards <br>his camp crying, \"By Allah, Mtlkammad (SaHallaho alaihe <br>wasalhm) has killed me!\" His people tried to cansole him <br>and told him that it was only a bruise and there was noth- <br>ing to worry h u t ,  but he would say, \"Muhammad (~allal- <br>laho alaihe wasellam) had once announced to me in Mecca <br>that he would kill me. By Allah, had he only spat at me, I <br>would be no more.\" It is said that he cried like a bull. Abu <br>Sufyan, who was very active on that day, put him to shame <br>for crying in that manner over a slight wound, but he said, <br>\"Do you know who has inflicted this injury upon me? It <br>was none other than Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). By Laat and Uzza! if my agony be distributed over all <br>the people of Hijaaz, none of them would survive. Since <br>the time he had declared that he would kill me, I was sure <br>that I would meet my death at his hands. If he only spat at <br>me after that declaration, I would be no more.\" So he died <br>on his way hack, at a day's journey from Mecca. <br>Look! a disbeliever like Ubbay bin Khalaf is so sure <br>about the truth of the Prophet's words that he does not <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of <br>punishment, who knows, may last for thousands of years. <br>Hadith VII <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favours on <br>a person who is mindful of his salaat, viz: His daily bread <br>is made easy for him; he is saved from the punishments in <br>the grave; he shall receive his record in his right hand on <br>the Day of Judgement; he shall cross the Siraat with the <br>speed of lightning and he shall enter Paradise without reck- <br>oning. As for him who neglects his salaat, he shall meet <br>five types of punishments in this world, three at the time of <br>death, three in the grave and three after resurrection. <br>Those in this world are: he is not blessed in life; he is <br>deprived of the light with which the faces of the righteous <br>are endowed; he receives no rewards for his good practices; <br>his prayers are not answered; and he has no share in the <br>prayers of the pious. Those at the time of death are: he dies <br>disgracefully; he dies hungry; he dies in thirst; which the <br>water in the oceans of the world cannot quench. <br>Those in the grave are: He is so squeezed there that the <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other side; fire <br>is burnt inside for him and he is rolled on cinders day and <br>night; a serpent with fiery eyes and iron nails equal in <br>length to a day's journey is let loose on him and shouts <br>with a thundering voice, 'My Lord has charged me with <br>thrashing you till sunrise for neglecting Fajr, till Asr for <br>neglecting Zuhur, till sunset for neglecting Asr, till Ishaa <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in <br>mind that even after the declaration of a person as being <br>guilty, Allah is free to pardon him as and when he pleases. <br>He says in His Holy Book: <br>\"Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be as- <br>cribed unto Him. Allah pardoneth all (save that) whom <br>He will. <br>(IV: 116)\" <br>If then it pleases Allah to pardon anybody neglecting <br>salaat, it will be most fortunate; but who can be sure of this <br>fortune? <br>It is also stated in hadith that there will be three courts <br>to be held by Allah on the Day of Judgement. The first will <br>judge between kufr and islaam and there will be no pardon. <br>The second will be to judge the duties and conduct of one <br>towards another. All aggrieved shall be compensated there; <br>compensation will either be realised from the aggressor or <br>paid by Allah Himself, if He pleases to pardon anybody. <br>The third will deal with duties towards Allah. Here the <br>doors of Allah's mercy will be thrown wide-open and He <br>shall pardon anybody He wills. In the light of all that has <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>to have seen (in his dream) a group of people being treated <br>likewise. Jiba-eel (Alayhis salaam) informed him on his <br>query that thpse were the persons who used to neglect their <br>salaat. <br>Mujahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"Allah blesses the <br>people who guard their salaat, just as he blessed Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) and his descendants.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If a <br>person dies with sincere Imaan, observing the command- <br>ments of Allah, performing salaat, and paying Zakaat, <br>when he dies Allah is pleased with him.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Allah says, 'I hold back retribution, deserved by a locality, <br>when I see therein some people who frequently visit the <br>musjid, love one another for My sake, and pray for forgive- <br>ness in the hours of darkness.\" <br>Hadhmt Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) wrote to <br>Hadhrat Salmaan: \"Spend most of your time in the musiid. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"The musjid is the abode of the pious. Allah has <br>taken upon Himself to bless the person who spends most of <br>I <br>I<br>I <br>I <br>I <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand- <br>ing at a distance.\" <br>One of the companions reports that, when the inmates <br>of the Prophet's house were hard-pressed in any way, he <br>would enjoin salaat on them and recite the following verse: <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision, We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for the righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that she heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"All the <br>people will be gathered together on the Day of Judgement <br>and they will all hear the voice of the announcing angel. <br>He will say, 'where are those who glorified Allah in ease <br>and adversity?' A group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. It will then be announced, 'where are <br>those who forsook their beds and spent their nights in <br>worship?' Another group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. The angel will again announce, 'where <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The <br>reckoning will then commence after these three groups <br>have been eliminated.\" <br>It is said that during the early times people could see <br>Satan. A person approached him saying how could he be <br>like him. Satan told him that had he never received such a <br>request before and asked hin? what had prornpted him to <br>ask for it. The person told him that he wished it from his <br>heart. Satan told him to neglect his salaat and to swear very <br>frequently, not caring whether he was doir~g it truthfully. <br>The person told Satan that he would swear by Allah never <br>to give up salaat and swear falsely. Satan told him that <br>never before he had been tricked by a human being to seek <br>his advice. He was determined never to do so in future. <br>Xadhrat Ubayv (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Give glad tidings to the Muslims that they shall be hon- <br>oured and exalted, and their religion shall prevail, but <br>there is no portion in the Hereafter for those who exploit <br>Islam for wordlv gains.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"I saw Allah in His best form. He said to me, '0 <br>'Muhammad! what are the Highest Chiefs (Angels) arguing <br>about'?' I said, 'I have no knowledge about that.' Allah <br>i<br>I <br>, <br>l <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the <br>questioning of Angels, is a shade against the Sun on the <br>Day of Judgement, is a protection against the fire of Hell, is <br>a weight for the scales of good deeds, is a means of swift <br>crossing over the Siraat arid is a key to Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthmarl (Radhiyallaho anho) is reported to <br>have said. \"Allah bestows nine fdvours on a person who <br>guards his salaat and is particular in performing it at its ap- <br>pointed hours: viz; He is loved by Allah, he enjoys good <br>health, is constantly under the protection of angels, his <br>home is blessed, the light of righteousrless shines on his <br>face, his heart is made soft, he shall cross the Siraat with <br>the speed of lightning, he is saved from Hell, and his neigh- <br>bours in Paradise are those about whom Allah has said. <br>'There shall be no fear come upon them, neither shall <br>they grieve (11: 36). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Salaat <br>is the Pillar of Islam and it has ten virtues, viz: It is a charm <br>of the face, a light of the heart, health and refreshment for <br>the bodv, a companv in the grave, a means for the descent <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and <br>one who neglects Zuhr as '0 you loser', and one who ig- <br>nores Asr as '0 you transgressor', and one who omits <br>Maghrib as '0 you kaafir', and one who does not say Ishaa <br>as '0you violator of Allah's commandments.\" <br>Alama Sha'raani (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"It should <br>be clearly understood that a calamity is drawn off from a <br>locality the people of which are particular about salaat, <br>whereas a locality the people of which neglect salaat is fre- <br>quently visited by calamities. Earthquakes, thunderbolts <br>and sinking of houses are not unexpected where people are <br>not particular about salaat. Simply guarding one's own <br>salaat is not enough, because when a calamity strikes, it <br>does not befall the wrongdoers alone. It affects everybody <br>in that locality. Once the Sahabah asked the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Can we perish while there are <br>pious people among us?\" the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) replied, \"Yes, if vice becomes predominant.\" It <br>is therefore necessary that other people should also be en- <br>joined to stick to Allah's commandments and refrain from <br>wrongdoing. <br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0 <br>Allah! cause not any one of us to be a wretched destitute.'? <br>He then said: \"Do you know who is a wretched destitute?\" <br>At the'request of the companions, he explained to them <br>saying, \"A wretched destitute is he who neglects his salaat. <br>In Islaam there is nothing for him.\" In another hadith it is <br>said, \"Allah will not care a bit for the person who has been <br>neglecting salaat intentionally, and for him shall be an <br>awful doom.\" <br>It is reported in a hadith that ten persons will be <br>specially tormented, and one of them will be the person <br>who neglects his salaat. It is said that his hands will be tied <br>while the angels shall smite him on his face and back. Par- <br>adise will tell him, 'In me there is no room for you,' and <br>Hell will sav to him, 'Come to me. You are for me and I am <br>for you.' It is also reported that there is a valley in Hell <br>named Lamlam. This vallev is infested with serpents as fat <br>as the neck of a camel and as long as one month's journey. <br>A person neglecting salaat shall be tormented in this <br>valley. 111 another hadith, it is reported that there is a vale <br>in the Hell. which is krlown as the Pit of Grief; it is infested <br>with scorpions of the size of a mule. This place is also <br>meant for tormenting the people who neglect salaat. Of <br>course, there is nothing to worry if the most merciful Allah <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"There is no place in Islaam for a person who <br>does .not say his salaat, and there is no salaat without <br>wudhu.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) also heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying. \"There is no Islaam in a person when <br>there is no salaat by him. The position of salaat in <br>Islaam is as the position of the head in a body.\" <br>Let those who do not offer salaat, and not onlv call <br>themselves Muslims, but also boast of their being cham- <br>pions of the Muslim cause, ponder over these words of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They dream of <br>reviving the past glory of Islaam. but would not care to <br>know how rigidly the people responsible for that glory <br>stuck to the practices of Islaam. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhivallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eve. People told him that the dis- <br>ease could be treated, but he would have to miss his salaat <br>for a few days. He said: \"This is not possible; I have heard <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer- <br>tain man and said, \"Take this one; he is particular about <br>his salaat. But you are not to beat him. We are forbidden to <br>beat one who says salaat.\" We, on the other hand, mock at <br>our servant and consider him a liability if he goes for <br>salaat. <br>Sufyaan 'rhauri (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous Soofi <br>once fell into a state of ecstasy. He remained in his house <br>for seven days without sleep, food and drink. When his <br>Shaikh was informed of his condition, he inquired if Su- <br>fyaan was observing the hours of his salaat. He was told <br>that his salaat was quite regular and safe. At this, the <br>Shaikh remarked, \"Glory be to Allah, Who has not allowed <br>the Devil to have an upper hand on him! \" <br><br>PART I1 <br>IMPORTANCE OF JAMAAT <br>As has already been said in tne foreword, there are many <br>who say their salaat regularly but are not very particular <br>about Jamaat. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>as emphatic in enjoining Jamaat as he is particular about <br>salaat. This part also consists of two chapters. The first <br>deals with the rewards of Jamaat and the second with the <br>consequences of its neglect. <br>CHAPTER I <br>REWARDS OF JAMAAT <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) saying: \"A salaat with Jamaat is twenty-seven <br>times superior to salaat performed individually.\" <br>When we offer our salaat for getting reward from <br>Allah, then why should it not be done in the musjid, where <br>the reward earned is twenty-seven times more. Nobody <br>will be so unwise as to forego a profit twenty-seven times <br>greater with simply a little extra labour. But we are so in- <br>different about the profits promised for our religious prac- <br>tices! This can be due to nothing but our disregard for deen <br>and the rewards of it. It is a pity that we apply ourselves so <br>hard to acquiring the trifling gains in this material world; <br>but are so unmindful of the gains in the Hereafter, which <br>yield twenty-seven times more with a little extra effort. We <br>often argue that for going to the musjid for Jamaat we have <br>to close the shop and will thus lose business. These pre- <br>texts and others of the kind cannot stand in the way of <br>those who have perfect faith in the Greatness of Allah, and <br><br>Part I1 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>28 <br>in His word; and who realize the value of the blessings and <br>reward in the Hereafter. It is in respect of such people that <br>Allah says: <br>\"Men, whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>then from remembrance of Allah and constancy in <br>salaat.\" <br>(XXIV;37). <br>It is said of Saalim Haddaad (Rahmatullah alaih] (a .-,-<br>trader and a great Soofi) that on hearing Azaan he would <br>g 2<br>turn pale and grow restless. He would stand up immedi- .Ez<br>ately, leaving his shop open and recite these couplets:- <br>><br>1. \"When Thy summoner stands up to summon, <br>quickly I stand up. <br>To respond to (the summons of) The Mighty Lord <br>Who hath no peer.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"I reply to the summons with complete submis- <br>sion and cheer, 'Here am I, 0 Bountiful One.\" <br>3. \t<br>\"My face grows pale with awe and fear, and occu- <br>pation in Thee distracts me from all other occupa- <br>tions.\" <br>4. <br>\"I swear by Thee, naught is dear to me save Thy <br>remembrance. <br>Nothing is more ravishing for me than Thy sweet <br>name.\" <br>5. \t \"0,will th'ere be a time for us to be together? <br>A lover is happy only when he is with his love.\" <br>6. \"He whose eyes have seen the light of Thy Beauty <br>Can never be solaced. He must die yearning for <br>Thee.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"People frequenting the musjid <br>are its pegs (dwellers). Angels are their companioris and <br>visit them when they are sick and help them when they are <br>at their jobs.\" <br>Hadith I1 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\" <br>In Hadith No. I, the superiority of salaat with Jamaat <br>over that offered individually is described as being twenty- <br>seven times more, while this hadith mentions only twenty- <br>five times. Various theologians have discussed at length <br>this seeming inconsistency. The following are some of the <br>explanations: <br>1. \t \"This variation from twenty-five to twenty-seven <br>is due to variation of ikhlaas (sincerity) in differ- <br>ent individuals.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"In Sirri (quiet) salaat (i.e., Zuhr and Asr), it is <br>twenty-five times, while in Jahri (loud) salaat (i.e., <br>Fajr, Maghrib and Ishaa), it is twenty-seven <br>times.\" <br>3. \t \"In Fajr and Ishaa, when it is somewhat incon- <br>venient to go out due to cold and darkness, it is <br>twenty-seven times, but in other salaats it is <br>twenty-five times.\" <br>4. \t \"In the beginning it was twenty-five times, but <br>subsequently Allah (by special favour on the fol- <br>lowers of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>raised the reward to twenty-seven times.\" <br>1 <br>I <br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the <br>ihraam (Hajj apparel) at his house, leaves for Hajj\". <br>Further, in the same hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) points to another act of great value; i.e., as <br>long as one remains sitting in musjid after the salaat is <br>over, the angels pray for him asking for forgiveness and <br>mercy. The angels are the innocent and holy creation of <br>Allah. So, the effectiveness of their prayers is self-evident. <br>Muhammad bin Samaak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous theologian and Sheikh. He died at the age of one <br>hundred and three. He used to perform two hundred <br>rakaats of nafl salaat daily. He writes: \"For forty years, I <br>never _missed the first takbeer of salaat with Jamaat, except <br>once when my mother had died.\" The same Shaikh writes: <br>\"Once I missed the Jamaat. As I knew that salaat with <br>Jamaat was twenty-five times superior, I repeated this <br>salaat (individually) twenty-five times to make up the loss. <br>I heard in my dream some one saying to me, 'Muhammad! <br>You have repeated your salaat 25 times (in the hope of <br>making good the loss), but what about the 'Aameen' by the <br>Angels?\" It is reported in many ahaadith that when the <br>Imaam says 'Aameen' after Fatihah, the Angels also say <br>Aameen and all the past sins of a person whose Ameen <br>coincides with that of the Angels are forgiven. This is <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: \"If one wishes to meet Allah on the Day of Judge- <br>ment as a Muslim, he must say his salaat at a place <br>where Azaan is called out, viz., a musjid, as Allah has <br>prescribed through His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) such practices which are nothing but guid- <br>ance through and through: and salaat (with Jamaat) is <br>one of them. If you start saying your salaat at your <br>houses (as.so and so is doing), then vou will be dis-<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) led the salaat at his instance, and <br>he himself joined the Jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to him, <br>\"Worship your Lord as if you see Him before you, count <br>yourself among the dead, beware of the curse of the <br>wronged ones and, even if you could crawl to the musjid, <br>do not miss Ishaa and Fajr with Jamaat.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"Ishaa and Fajr are very <br>heavy on those who are munaafiq. If they knew the reward <br>of the Jamaat, they would go to the musjid and join the <br>Jamaat even if they had to crawl.\" <br>Hadith IV <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Maalik (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>saying, \"A person who in all sincerity is constant in <br>his salaat with Jamaat for forty days, without missing <br>the first takbeer, recieves two awards: one for deliv- <br>erance from Hell and the ~ t h e r  for freedom from <br>nifaaq.\" <br>If a person is regular in his salaat (with sincerity) for <br>forty days and joins the Jamaat from the very start (i.e., <br>when the Imaam calls out his first takbeer), then he shan <br>neither be a munaafiq nor shall he go to Hell. A munaafiq <br>is a person who feigns being a Muslim, but there is kufr in <br>his heart., Genesis of man (according to hadith) takes place <br>in periods of forty days. This seems to be the significance <br>of forty days in this hadith, and so the Soofis attach import- <br>ance to this period (called Chillah in Urdu) for purposes of <br>spiritual discipline. <br>Lucky indeed are the persons who do not miss their <br>first takbeer for years together. <br>Hadith V <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who performs wudhu scrupulously, <br>and then goes to the musjid and finds that Jamaat is <br>over, receives a reword equal to that of Jamaat. This <br>would not diminish anything from the reward of those <br>who have actually performed their salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>This is indeed Allah's great favour and beneficence <br>that the mere effort and a slight exertion is enough to en- <br>title us to a reward of Jamaat, though actually we fail to <br>join it. Who is the loser then if we ourselves get left, and <br>miss the bounties of the most Bountiful? <br>This hadith also shows that we-should not postpone <br>going to the musjid in apprehension of the Jamaat being <br>over. Even if we find on reaching the musjid that Jamaat is <br>over, we will still get the reward thereof. If, however, we <br>are certain that the Jamaat is already over, then there is of <br>course no idea in going to the musjid for Jamaat. <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not <br>correct, as in the first place they are deprived of the reward <br>of saying salaat in the musjid and secondly, they lose the <br>blessing of salaat with a big Jamaat. The bigger the congre- <br>gation, the more pleasing it is to Allah. When our sole dim <br>is to achieve the pleasure of Allah, why should we not <br>adopt a manner more pleasing to Him. It is reported in a <br>hadith that Allah is pleased to see three things, namely, a <br>row of worshippers offering salaat with Jamaat, a persor, <br>busy in salaat at the time of Tahajjud at the dead of night, <br>and a person fighting in the way of Allah.\" <br>Hadith VII <br>Hadhrat Sahl bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Give glad tidings to those who go to the <br>musjid frequently during hours of darkness, for they <br>will have perfect light on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the <br>Qur'an' <br>\"He only shall tend Allah's musjid who believes in <br>Allah and the L,ast Day.\" <br>(IV:18).\" <br>The following are a few more ahaadith about the vir- <br>tues of salaat with Jamaat:- <br>1. \t \"Making wudhu when inconvenient, walking to- <br>wards 'the musjid and sitting there (after one <br>salaat), waiting for the next salaat, wipe out the <br>sins.\" <br>2. \t \"The farther a person lives from the 'musjid' the <br>greater the hlessing he receives.\" This is so be- <br>cause a person coming from a distance shall have <br>to walk more and, as already mentioned, every <br>step will fetch him a blessing. For this very reason <br>some companions have been reported to be taking <br>short steps in going to the musjid in order to earn <br>more blessings. <br>3. \t<br>\"There are three things in this world for which <br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>explain the importance of salaat with Jamaat, but their <br>explanations vary with the extent of their understanding <br>and their power to probe into Divine secrets. Our respected <br>Shaikh, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (may Allah illumine his <br>grave), in his famous Book 'Hujjatullahil Balighah' <br>writes:-<br>\"To save the people from the fatal effects that their <br>own customs and rituals can bring them, there is nothing <br>more useful than to make one of the religious services so <br>common a custom and so public a ritual that it may be per- <br>formed openly before everybody by any person, whether he <br>be learned or illiterate. The town-folk and the countrymen <br>should both be equally anxious to observe it. It should <br>become a subject of rivalry and pride among all of them, <br>and ~t should be so universally practised that it becomes <br>part and parcel of their social set-up, so much so, that life <br>without it may be worthless for them. If this is achieved, it <br>will help in establishing the worship and obedience of <br>Allah and will form a very useful substitute for those <br>rituals and customs which could cause them serious harm. <br>Since salaat is the only religious observance that surpasses <br>all others in importance and universality, both in reason <br>and authority, it becomes therefore absolutely necessary to <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>hearts and souls turned to Him alone, have the wonderful <br>effect of causing His blessings and Mercy to descend from <br>Heaven. <br>\"Moreover, the Muslim community has been raised so <br>that the word of Allah be held supreme and Islamic Order <br>be paramount over all others. This object cannot be <br>achieved unless all Muslims, big and small, the elite and <br>the common, the town folk and the countrymen, perform <br>alike the most sublime service and the most sacred ritual of <br>Islam (i.e., salaat) by assembling together in one place. It is <br>for this reason that the Sharee-at (Islamic Law) lays such <br>special stress on Friday congregation and on salaat with <br>jamaat, by explaining the blessings that accrue therefrom <br>and punishments awarded for neglect 1 lereof. For the open <br>and conspicuous observance of this im?ortant service, two <br>types of assemblies are required: one fr~rpeople of a clan or <br>a particular locality and the other for the people of the <br>whole town. Since the assembly or\" the former at any hour <br>is convenient and that of the latte, comparatively difficult, <br>so for the former, the gathering for salaat (with jamaat) five <br>times daily, has been laid down and in the case of the latter <br>gathering, the weekly Friday salaat has been devised and <br>ordained.\" <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>REPROACH ON GIVING UP JAMAAT <br>Just as Allah has promised rewards and blessings for <br>adhering to His commandments, so has He warned us of <br>the woeful consequences and punishments for their neg- <br>lect. We are in bondage to Allah and as such it is obligatory <br>on us to obey Him. No compensation or reward is due to us <br>for our obedience to Him. If He gives a reward, it is surely a <br>matter of His extreme favour on us. Similarly no punish- <br>ments can be too much for us if we disobey Him-our Lord, <br>for their can be no greater crime for a bondsman than to <br>disobey his Master. Hence no warning or premonition was <br>required to be imparted. Yet Allah and His Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) have so very kindly cautioned <br>us in various ways, warned us frequently of the conse-<br>quences and explained to us again and again, just to save <br>us from disaster. If even then, we don't take a lesson, who <br>collld there be to save us from the inevitable consequences? <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"I <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"If a person in spite of hearing the azaan does not go to <br>the musjid (and he prefers to say his salaat at home) <br>without a strong excuse, then his salaat is not ac-<br>cepted. When the Companions inquired as to what <br>could be a strong excuse, he replied, \"Illness or fear.\" <br>It may perhaps appear from this Hadith that the salaat <br>performed at home (after hearing the Azaan) is no salaat at <br>all; the Hanafiyyah do not hold this view. According to <br>them, though the reward and blessings promised for fardh <br>salaat will not be awarded, yet the person saying the salaat <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus- <br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those <br>places (mosques) where the Azaan is said: \"On the day <br>when the glory of Saaq is revealed and they are or- <br>dered to prostrate themselves, but are not able, with <br>eyes downcast, abasement stupifying them. And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br>Virtues of Sajaat <br>2. \t<br>These shall be infidels who did not say salaat at all. <br>3. \t These shall be the munaafiqeen. (Allah knows best and <br>His knowledge is most perfect). <br>What a terrible thing to be so abased and disgraced on <br>the Day of Judgement that, while all Muslims shall fall <br>prostrate at seeing Allah's glory, those who neglected salaat <br>with jamaat shall be singled out by their inability to do so. <br>Besides these, many other warnings have been given <br>against the neglect of jamaat. But as a matter of fact, none is <br>necessary for a good Muslim to whom the word of Allah <br>and His Apostle (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is all import- <br>ant. And for one who has no regard for their word, all such <br>warnings are meaningless. But a time will come when <br>every soul shall be called to account, and punished for its <br>misdeeds, and then no amount of penitence shall be of any <br>avail. <br><br>PART111 <br>IMPORTANCE OF SINCERITY AND DEVOTION IN <br>SALAAT <br>There are many persons who offer their salaat and <br>quite a lot of them are particular about jamaat as well, but <br>they say it so imperfectly that, instead of earning blessings <br>and reward for them, it is rejected forthwith. This, how- <br>ever, is not so bad as to discard salaat altogether, which as <br>we have already learnt, is very serious. Although we are <br>deprived of the rewards by saying a defective salaat, which <br>is not accepted, yet we are saved from the insolence of neg- <br>lecting and disobeying Allah's commandments. However, <br>when we spend our time, leave our work and undergo in- <br>convenience, then why should we not see that we get the <br>best return for our time and labour by saying our salaat as <br>best as we can? <br>This third part is divided into three chapters. In the <br>first chapter, a few quotations from the Holy Qur'an about <br>the people who are condemned for their bad salaat and <br>those who are praised for their good salaat, are given. In the <br>second Chapter, stories about the salaat of a few lovers of <br>Allah are collected. The third chapter consists of the say- <br>ings of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on this <br>subject. <br>CHAPTER I <br>QUOTATIONS FROM THE QUR'AN <br>\"Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah, but devo- <br>tion from you reacheth to Him.\" <br>(XXII:37) <br>Although this particular verse refers to the animal sac- <br>rifice, yet in principle it equally applies to all other rituals. <br>It is sincerity and devotion in a service by which its accept- <br>ance would be judged by Allah. Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice. He replied, 'Be sincere in all your <br>services, as sincerity will magnify the value of an action, <br>however insignificant it may be.\" <br>Hadhrat Thaubaan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Blessed be the sincere ones, for they are the lamps of <br>guidance. They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>ent interpretations: <br>1. To be so careless as to miss the correct time of salaat. <br>2. <br>To be inattentive in salaat. <br>3. To forget the number of rakaats. <br>\"When they (the hypocrites) stand up for salaat, they <br>perform it without earnestness and want but to be seen <br>by men and are mindful of Allah but little.\" <br>(IV: 142) <br>\"Now there hath succeeded them (Prophets) a later <br>generation who have ruined salaat and have followed <br>lusts. So they will meet Ghayy.\" <br>(XIX:59) <br>69 <br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after. According to many commentators, Ghayy is a pit in <br>Hell full of blood and pus. The persons who had ruined <br>their salaat shall be thrown into this pit. <br>Quotation- V<br>I <br>\"And naught preventeth that their (the hypocrites) <br>contributions should be accepted from them, save that <br>they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Apostle, and <br>they come not to worship, save as idlers, and pay3 not <br>i <br>(their contribution) save reluctantly.\" <br>(IV:54) <br>Note: The quotations I to V above relate to those who ruin <br>salaat. On the other hand, the following speak of <br>those whom Allah praises for their good salaat. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>\"Successful indeed are the believers who are humble <br>in their salaat. And who shun vain conversation. And <br>I \t<br>who are payers of the Zakaat. And who abstain from <br>sex, save from their wives or the slaves that their right <br>hand possess, for then they are not blameworthy but <br>who craveth beyond that, such are transgressors-And <br>who faithfully observe their pledges and their cove- <br>nants. And who pav heed to their salaat. These are the <br>heirs who will inherit Firdaus (Paradise). There they <br>will abide.\" <br>(XXIII:1to 11) <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Fir- <br>daus is the apex and the best portion of Paradise, where- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from all its rivers originate. Allah's throne will be placed <br>there. When you pray for Paradise, always pray for Fir- <br>daus.\" <br>\"And truly it (salaat) is hard save for the humble- <br>minded; who know that they have to meet their Lord, <br>and that unto Him they are returning.\" <br>(11: 45-46) <br>Quotation- VIII <br>\"In houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted, <br>and His name shall be remembered therein, do offer <br>praise to Him at morning and evening, men whom <br>neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remem- <br>berance of Allah and establishment of salaat and <br>paying Zakaat, who fear that Day when the hearts and <br>the eyeballs will be overturned so that Allah may <br>reward them for the best of what they did and increase <br>reward for them out of His bounty. Allah giveth bles- <br>sings without measure to whom He will.\" (XXIV: 36 to 38) <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says <br>\"Establishment of salaat means performance of ruku and <br>sajdah properly and constant concentration in salaat with <br>complete humility and submission.\" Hadhrat Qataadah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Wherever the words 'Establish- <br>ment of salaat' occur in Qur'ar,, they mean to guard its <br>hours, to perform wudhu in the right manner and to ob- <br>serve ruku and saidah properlv.\" <br><br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>I <br>I <br>\"The (faithful) slaves of Rahmaan (the Beneficent) are <br>they who walk upon the earth modestly and when the <br>foolish ever address them, they answer: Peace; and <br>who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and <br>standing.\" <br>(XXV: 63 -64) <br>After describing a few more qualities of His faithful <br>slaves, Allah says in the same context: <br>2 <br>\"They will be awarded the high place for as much as <br>they were steadfast, and they will meet therein with <br>welcome and the word of peace. Abiding there for <br>ever. Happy is it as abode and station.\" <br>(XXV: 75-76) <br>\"The believers in our revelations are those who forsake <br>their beds, to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and <br>spend of what We have bestowed on them. No soul <br>knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy, as a reward <br>for what they used to do.\" <br>(XXXII:16-17) <br>\"I,o! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens <br>and water-springs, taking to that which their Lord <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>giveth them; for Lo! aforetime they were doers of good. <br>Thev used to s l e e ~  <br>but. little in the night.

But only men of <br>understanding will pay heed.\" <br>(XXXIX:9) <br>And angels would be entering through every door pro- <br>claiming: \"Peace be upon you, as a reward for your <br>perseverance on religious practices.\" Thus how splen- <br>did would be their end! <br>(XIII: 22-23). <br>\"Lo! man was created very impatient. Fretful when <br>evil befalleth him. And niggardly when good befalleth <br>him, save the worshippers who are constant at their <br>salaat.\" <br>(LXX: 19-23) <br>After giving some more qualities of these blessed <br>people, Allah says in the same context, <br>II <br>~ <br>I <br>I<br>I<br>Part 111 [a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>\"And those who guard their salaat. These will dwell in <br>gardens, honoured.\" <br>(LXX:34-35). <br>Besides the quotations given above, there are many <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an enjoining salaat and exalting and <br>extolling those who say their salaat properly. Salaat is <br>indeed a great boon. That is why Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of my eyes', and <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) prayed to Allah, <br>\"My Lord! make me to establish Salaat, and some of <br>my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept the prayer.\" <br>(XIV:40) <br>Here the eminent Prophet of Allah, whom Allah has <br>called 'Khaleel', is asking Allah to make him say his salaat <br>properly and regularly. The Glorious Allah Himself is or- <br>dering His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>thus:-<br>\"And enjoin salaat upon the people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision. We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>It is said in a hadith that whenever the housefolk of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were hard-pressed in <br>any way, he enjoined salaat on them and used to recite this <br>verse. All the Prophets of Allah (peace be upon them) are <br>reported to have engaged themselves in salaat whenever <br>they had any difficulty. But, alas! we are so unmindful and <br>indifferent about salaat that, in spite of all that we proclaim <br>about Islaam and Islamic practices, we pay no attention to <br>it. But on the contrary, if anybody stands up to invite us <br>and to draw our attention towards it, we cut jokes and <br>sneer at him and oppose him, thereby harming none else <br>but ourselves. <br>Even those who offer the salaat, often perform it in <br>such a way that it will not be wrong to call it a mockery of <br>salaat, as it lacks the proper observation of its requisites</p></div>"

(Sallallaho alaihe u~asallam) has com-<br>pared Islam to a canopy resting on five supports. The Kali- <br>mah is the central support and the other four pillars of <br>Islam are. so to say, the remaining four supports. one at <br>each corner of the canopy. Without the central support, the <br>canopy cannot possibly stand. and if any one of the corner <br>supports is missing a collapse will result in the defective <br>corner. Now, let us judge for ourselves how far we have <br>kept up the canopv of Islam. Is there really any pillar that <br>is being held in its proper place? <br>L <br>The five pillars of Islam mentioned in this Hadith sig- <br>nifv the most essential duties of a Muslim. Although a <br>hluslim cannot do without any one of them, vet salaat in <br>Isldrn ctccupies a position next onlv to Ilnaan. Hadhrat Ab-<br>dullah bin Mas'ood (Kadhi~allaho <br>anho) savs: <br>\"Once, I inquired of tht: tioly Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), which act (of man) was the dearest to <br>Allah. The Prophet replied, 'saiaat'. I then inquired which <br>act came next (in order of merit) and the Prophet replied, <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>'Kindness to parents'. I again asked what was next and he <br>answered 'Jihaad'.\" <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted this <br>Hadith in support of the belief that salaat is the most inl- <br>portant religious duty after Imaan. This is further corrobo- <br>rated by a hadith, in which the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said: <br>\"Salaat is the best of all that has been ordained by <br>Allah.\" <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came <br>out of his house. It was autumn and the leaves were falling <br>off the trees. He caught hold of a branch of a tree and its <br>leaves began to drop in large number. At this he remarked, <br>'0,Abu Zar! (Radhiyallaho anho) when a Muslim offers his <br>salaat to please Allah, his sins are shed awav from him just <br>as these leaves are falling off this tree.\" <br>In autumn, usually, the leaves of the trees fall in large <br>numbers, so much so that on some trees not a single leaf is <br>left behind. The same is the effect of salaat performed with <br>sincerity and devotion. All the sins of the person offering <br>salaat are wiped off. It should, however, be remembered <br>that according to the verdict of the theologians, it is only <br>the saghaa'ir (minor sins) that are forgiven by the perform- <br>ance of salaat and other services. The kabaa'ir (major sins) <br>are r,ot pardoned without repentance. We should, there- <br>fore, in addition to saying salaat, be particular about doing <br>taubah (repentance) and istighfaar (seeking forgiveness). <br>AHah may, however, pardon, by His bountiful Grace, even <br>the kabaa'ir of any person because of his salaat. <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Hadhrat Abu Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"I was <br>once sitting under a tree with Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyal- <br>!ah0 anho). He caught hold of a dry branch of the tree and <br>shook it till all its leaves fell off. He then said to me, \"0, <br>Abu Uthman! (Radhiyallaho anho) Will you not ask me <br>why I am doing this?\" \"Do tell me,\" I entreated. He said, <br>\"The Apostle of Allah had done exactly like this before me, <br>while I was with him under a tree. He caught a dry branch <br>of it and shook it, till all its leaves fell off\". At this he said: <br>'0, Salmaan! (Radhiyallaho anho) will you not ask me why <br>I am doing this?' I replied: 'Do tell me why you are doing <br>this?' He remarked: \"Verily when a Muslim takes wudhu <br>properly and then observes his salaat five times a day, his <br>sins fall off just as these leaves have fallen off. He then re- <br>cited the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>\"Establish salaat at the two ends of the day, and at the <br>approaches of the night. Verily, good deeds annul ill <br>deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. (XI: 114)\" <br>The behaviour of Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) in the above hadith displays the profound love <br>which the Sahabah had for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>wasallam). They would often cherish the sweet memories <br>of the time when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>was living among them. They would, while quoting him, <br>enact exactly what they had seen him doing at a particular <br>moment. <br>It is really very difficult to cover all the traditions of <br>the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which deal <br>with the importance of salaat and which declare forgive- <br>ness for those who guard it. As had already been said <br>before, the theologians restrict this declaration of forgive- <br>ness to saghaa'ir (minor sins) only, but in the text of the <br>hadith there is no such restriction. My learned father gave <br>me two reasons for this. Firstly, it does not really become a <br>Muslim to commit any of the kabaa'ir (major sins). If per- <br>chance any such sins are committed by him, he cannot rest <br>in peace (due to inherent fear of Allah in him) until he <br>washes them with his tears of repentance in crying before <br>Allah. Secondly, the person who performs his salaat with <br>sincerity and thoroughness is very likely to do istighfaar <br>quite a number of times daily. Look for instance at the clos- <br>ing prayer of salaat itself, viz: <br>\"0,My Lord! I have wronged my soul a great wrong, <br>and none forgiveth sins save Thou alone. Then forgive <br>me and have mercy on me. Verily, Thou art the For- <br>giving, the Merciful.\" <br>In the above hadith, mention is made of wudhu to be <br>done properlv. We should, therefore, be sure of the regu- <br>lations about wudhu and try to observe all of these. For <br>example. take the case of miswaak. It is sunnat of wudhu, <br>but is very often neglected. It is said in a hadith that the <br>salaat offered after doing ~nisivaak is seventy times superior <br>to the salaat ~ ~ i t h o u t  <br>miswaak. In another hadith, use of <br>misuraak has been enjoined verv stronglv, and the follo~v- <br>irig benefits are attributed to it:- <br>\"It cleanses and sweetens the mouth and checks its <br>bad smell.\" <br>\"It is a cause of Allah's pleasure and a blow to the <br>Ilevil.\" <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Saiaat <br>\"Allah and his angels love the person doing miswaak.\" <br>\"It strengthens the gums and improves eye-sight.\" <br>\"It is a purge against bile and phlegm.\" <br>To crown all, \"It is a sunnah i.e. the practice of our be- <br>loved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" <br>As many as seventy virtues of the n~iswaak have been <br>enumerated by the theologians. It is said that a person in <br>the habit of miswaak dies with the Kalimah on his lips. <br>The rewards of taking wudhu properly are very many. It is <br>mentioned in ahaadith that the parts of body washed in <br>wudhu shall glitter on the Day of Judgement and, by this <br>(distinction), the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will <br>at once recognise his followers. <br>Hadith.-IV(a) <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>asked his companions, 'Do you believe that dirt can <br>remain on a person bathing five times a day in a brook <br>running in front of his door?' 'No', replied the compan- <br>ions, 'No dirt can remain on his body.' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'So, exactly <br>similar is the effect of salaat offered five times a day. <br>With the Grace of Allah. it washes away all the sins'.\" <br>Hadith.-IV(b) <br>\"Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>\"The likeness of five times daily salaat is as the like- <br>ness of a deep brook running in front of the door of a <br>person who bathes therein five times a day.\" <br>Running water is generally free from dirt, and the <br>deeper it runs the cleaner and purer it is. A bath in such <br>water surely removes dirt from the body and makes it <br>clean. Salaat offered with due regard for its essentials like- <br>wise cleanses the soul of all sins. There are several ahaa- <br>dith of the same meaning, though with slight variations in <br>expression, narrate& by different companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed <br>Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>'Each of the five salaats expiates the sins committed <br>since the salaat preceding it. To explain. let us take the <br>case of a person working in a factory. His job is such <br>that his body gets covered with dust. But there are five <br>streams of running water in between the factory and <br>his house and, on his return from the job, he takes a <br>bath in each stream. The effect of five times daily <br>salaat is quite similar. Any sins of omission and com- <br>mission between two salaats are forgiven on account of <br>'istighfaar and taubah in each salaat.' <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) through such <br>parables, aims at impressing that salaat has the wonderful <br>power of removing the sins. If we fail to avail of Allah's <br>mercy, surely we ourselves are the losers. <br>To err is human. We are likely to commit innumerable <br>acts of displeasing Allah and deserve thereby. His wrath <br>and punishment, but look how relenting our dear Allah is! <br>He has most graciously shown us the way to earn His <br>mercy and forgiveness. It is a great pity if we do not avail of <br>this great favour. Our Allah is always eager to show us His <br>mercy on very small grounds. It is said in a hadith, that if a <br>person goes to bed with the intention of getting up for Ta- <br>hajjud and perchance does not wake up, he receives the <br>full reward for Tahajjud, although he has been enjoying his <br>sleep at the time of Tahajjud. How boundless is the grace of <br>Allah and what a tremendous loss and deprivation if we do <br>not receive blessings from such a Giver. <br><br>i <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>\"Hadhrat Huzaifah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that, <br>wvenever the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>h ppened to face any difficulty, he would at once <br>r9sort to salaat.\" <br>0,<br>vr B <br>P d  <br>Salaat is a great blessing of Allah. To resort to salaat at <br>the time of worry is to hasten towards His mercy, and <br>when Allah's mercy comes to rescue, there can remain no <br>trace of any worry. There are many traditions concerning <br>this practice of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). Similar was the practice of his companions, who fol- <br>lowed him in the minutest detail. Hadhrat Abu Darda <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Whenever a strong wind blew, <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would immedi- <br>ately enter the musjid and would not leave until the wind <br>had subsided. Similarly, at the time of a solar or lunar <br>eclipse, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would at <br>I \t<br>once start offering salaat. Hadhrat Suhaib (Radhiyallaho <br>I \t<br>anho) was informed by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) that all the previous Apostles of Allah (peace be <br>upon them) also used to resort to salaat in all adversities. <br>Hadhrat Ibno Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) was once on <br>journey. On his way he got the news of the death of his <br>I \t<br>son. He got down from his camel and offered two rakaat of <br>salaat, praying in Tashahhud for a long time. He then re- <br>cited 'Innaa liliaahi wa innaallaihi raaji-oon' and said, \"I <br>have done what Allah has ordered us to do in His Holy <br>Book i.e.: <br>!p\\j+I*\\, <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat\" (11: 45). <br>Another similar story is narrated about him. He was on <br>a journey when he received the news about the death of his <br>brother Quthum. He descended from his camel by the road- <br>side, and performed two rakaats of salaat and kept praying <br>in Tashahhud for a long time. After finishing his salaat, he <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>rode his camel reciting the following verse of the Holy <br>Qur'an: <br>\"Seek Allah's help with patience and salaat, and truly <br>it is indeed hard except to the humble minded.\" <br>(11:45). <br>There is yet another story about him. On hearing of the <br>death of a wife of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), he fell down prostrate. When somebody asked him <br>the reason he said, \"Our dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) had enjoined on us to prostrate (in salaat) when- <br>ever a calamity were to befall us. What calamity can be <br>greater than the death of the Ummul-Mo'mineen?\" <br>When Hadhrat Ubaada (Radhiyallaho anho) was about <br>to breathe his last, he said to the people around him, \"I <br>prohibit one and all from crying over me. When my soul <br>departs, I ask every one to perform wudhu, observing all its <br>essentials, and to go to the musjid and pray for my forgive- <br>ness, because our Gracious Allah has enjoined on us to <br>\"Seek help with patience and salaat.\" After that, lay me <br>down in the pit of my grave.\" <br>Hadhrat Nadhr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"Once it <br>became very dark during the day in Madina. I hurriedly <br>went to Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) to know if he <br>had ever experienced similar conditions during the life- <br>time of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He <br>said to me. \"M'aathallaah! During those blessed days, <br>whenever the wind blew strong, we would hurry to the <br>musjid lest it should be the approach of the Last Day.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Salaam (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that whenever the members of the Prophet's family <br>were hardpressed in any way, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) would enjoin upon then1 to say salaat, <br>and would recite the following verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be thyself <br>constant therein. We ask not of thee to provide suste- <br>nance. We provide it for thee. And the Hereafter is for <br>the righteousness.\" <br>(XX: 132). <br>It is said in a hadith that when somebody is confronted <br>with a need, whether pertaining to this life or the Hereafter, <br>or whether it concerns Allah or a mortal, he should per- <br>form a perfect wudhu, offer salaat of two rakaats, glorify <br>Allah, then ask blessing for the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), and then pray as under: <br>0,<br>k\", m <br>\"There is no god save Allah-the Clement-the Bouqti-<br>ful. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the tremendous <br>throne. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I ask <br>Thee all that leadeth to Thy Mercy and deserveth Thy <br>forgiveness. I ask Thee abundance in all that is good <br>and refuge from all that is evil. Leave me no sin but <br>Thou pardonest it, and no distress but Thou removest <br>it, and no need but Thou fulfillest it. 0,most Merciful <br>of those who show mercy!\" <br>Wahb bin Munabbih writes: \"Have your needs fulfilled <br>by Allah through salaat. In the good old time, if a calamity <br>befell the people, they would hurry towards salaat.\" It is <br>said that in Koofah there was a porter who was well known <br>for his honesty. People trusted him with their valuables <br>and money, which he carried from one place to another. <br>Once he wps on his usual errand when a person-met him <br>on the wayland asked him about his destination. When the <br>porter gave him the required information, k s a i d ,  \"I am <br>also bound for the same destination. If I could walk, I <br>would have accompanied you on foot. Will you kindly give <br>me a lift on your mule for one dinaar?\" The porter agreed <br>and allowed him to share the mule with him. They came to <br>a crossing on the way. The person said, 'Now, which road <br>will you take?' 'The main road, of course,' replied the <br>porter. The person said, 'No, brother. We should go by the <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>other road which is a shortcut and there is plenty of grass <br>enroute to feed the animal.' The porter said, 'I have never <br>been on this path.' The person remarked, 'But I have travel- <br>led by this route quite often'. The porter believed him and <br>put the animal on that path. After some distance, the path <br>ended in a terrifying forest where a large number of dead <br>bodies were lying about. All of a sudden the person <br>jumped down from the mule and took out his knife with <br>the intention of slaying the porter. 'Hold your hand', <br>shouted the porter, 'Take the animal and its load, but do <br>not kill me'. The person refused to listen to his entreaty <br>and swore that he would first kill the porter and then take <br>possession of the animal and the goads. Seeing that his en- <br>treaties fell on deaf ears and that his cruel heart would not <br>melt, the porter said to him, 'All right if you must kill me, <br>then permit to say my salaat of only two rakaats.' The <br>person agreed and remarked, 'You can please yourself. All <br>the dead you see over here made the same request, but <br>their salaat was of no avail to them.' The porter started the <br>salaat, but could not recollect any soorah to connect with <br>the Fatihah, in spite of his best efforts. Meanwhile the <br>person grew impatient and pressed him hard to hurry up <br>with the salaat. All of a sudden the following verse flashed <br>to his mind: <br>'Is it not He Who answereth the wronged one when he <br>crieth unto Him, and removeth the evil. .. (XXVII-62). <br>The porter was reciting the verse and the tears welled <br>up in his eyes, when a horseman suddenly appeared on the <br>scene. He was wearing a glittering helmet and held a spear <br>in his hand. He pierced the body of the pitiless rogue with <br>his spear and killed him there and then. A flame of fire <br>rose from the spot where the dead body fell. The porter fell <br>down prostrate and thanked Allah. After finishing his <br>salaat, he ran towards the horseman and requested him to <br>disclose his identity. He replied, 'I am a slave to Him who <br>answereth the wronged one. You are now safe and can go <br>wherever you like.' Saying this, the horseman rode away <br>and disappeared. \" <br>Indeed salaat is a tremendous asset. Besides pleasing <br>Allah it often gets us deliverence from the calamities of this <br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>I <br>life and provides us with tranquility and eace of mind. <br>Ibn Seereen writes: \"If I be allowed to c Eoose between <br>Paradise and salaat of two rakaats, I would prefer salaat. <br>The reason is quite clear. Paradise is for my own pleasure <br>while salaat is for the pleasure of my dear Lord.\" The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: \"Enviable is <br>the lot of that Muslim who is with least encumbrance, <br>whose main fortune is salaat, who remains content with <br>humble provision throughout his life, who worshi s his <br>Lord in a dutiful manner, who lives a nameless li e and <br>P<br>who dies an early death, with very little to bequeath and <br>very few to mourn him.\" In another hadith, the Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said: 'Offer your salaat at your homes quite frequently, so <br>that these may be blessed with Allah's Grace and Mercy.\" <br>\"Abu Muslim narrates: I went to see Abu Umaamah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) while he was in the musjid. I <br>asked him if he had really heard the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"When a person per- <br>forms wudhu with right performance and then says his <br>fardh salaat, Allah forgives him all the sins committed <br>that day by his feet in going towards evil, by his hands <br>in doing evil, by his ears in listening to evil, by his <br>eyes in looking at evil and by his heart in thinking of <br>evil.' He replied, 'By Allah, I have heard these words <br>from the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>again and again.\" <br>Many of the companions have narrated this Hadith <br>with slight variations. Those endowed with the power of <br>Kashf can even witness the sins being shed. It is said of <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Imam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) that he could tell <br>from the water falling down from the limbs of the person <br>performing wudhu as to which sins had been washed off <br>therewith. In a narration by Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho), the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have warned against being wrong-headed in com- <br>mitting sins in the hope of getting them redeemed through <br>salaat. We have, really, no ground to behave as such on <br>this account. After all, what is the quality of the salaat that <br>we offer? If Allah merely absolves us of our obligation it is <br>His very special favour and grace. Again it is the height of <br>ingratitude to disobey Allah just because He is Clement, <br>Merciful and Forgiving. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"Two persons of one clan came to Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) and embraced Islam at one and the <br>same time. One of these was martyred in a battle and <br>the other died a year later, Hadhrat Talha bin Ubaidul- <br>lah (Radhiyallaho anho) says that he saw in his dream <br>that the person who had died later was admitted into <br>Paradise before the martyr. This surprised him. I do <br>not recollect whether it was he or somebody else who <br>narrated this dream. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) thereupon remarked: \"Has not the person <br>dying later fasted for one additional month of Rama- <br>dhaan, and has he not offered six thousand or odd ra- <br>kaats of salaat more during the year he lived after the <br>martyr?\" <br>Really, we do not know how valuable salaat is! The <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was often heard <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>2 3 <br>saying, \"The comfort of my eyes is in salaat.\" This is an ex- <br>pression of his profound love for salaat. As such, what else <br>can be more valuable than salaat? <br>Hadith.VII1 <br>Hadhrat Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"At the approach of the hour of a salaat, an <br>Angel is deputed to proclaim, 'Arise, 0 Children of <br>Aadam! and extinguish the fire that you have (by com- <br>mitting sins) kindled to burn yourselves. So, the <br>people rise up, perform wudhu and offer their Zuhr <br>prayer. This causes forgiveness of their sins committed <br>since day-break. The same is repeated at Asr, Maghrib <br>and Ishaa. After Ishaa people go to bed, but there are <br>some who busy themselves in good, while some others <br>in evil deeds. <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"After <br>Ishaa the people get divided into three groups. There are <br>some for whom the night is a source of blessing and gain. <br>They are those who spend it in the worship of Allah, while <br>other people are asleep. For them the night brings great <br>reward from their Lord. There are others who turn their <br>night into a burden and curse for themselves, for they in- <br>dulge in various dark deeds in the dead of night. To them <br>the night brings woe and misery. There is the third group <br>of people who go to bed immediately after Ishaa; they <br>neither gain nor lose.\" <br>Hadith.1X <br>djG 5, JG <br>I j&; j G  JG <br>A, &j gj$ hij &i2 <br>O<br>,<br> <br>,J+<br>3. ai <br>..A@, +,& <br>&i 3 b$,J&, <br>*+<br>>f! <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>Hadbrat Abu Qataadah bin Rab'iyy (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"He heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, Allah has said, \"0, Muhammad! I <br>have ordained five times daily salaat for thy followers. <br>I have made a covenant with myself that whosoever is <br>regular in performing his salaat at its fixed hour, he <br>shall be admitted into the Paradise. Those of thy fol- <br>lowers who do not guard their salaat, are not included <br>in this covenant.\" <br>In another hadith, it is said that Allah has ordained <br>five times salaat and whosoever is mindful of his salaat, by <br>doing wudhu properly and by praying at fixed hours with <br>sincerity and devotion, is assured by Allah of his entry into <br>Paradise; and whosoever does not guard his salaat, there is <br>no such guarantee for him; he may-or may not be forgiven. <br>salaat has indeed a tremendous value. It affords us an op- <br>portunity to 'receive Allah's guarantee for Paradise. When <br>an honourable person of some financial standing or having <br>executive power gives us a guarantee or stands surety for <br>meeting any of our requirements of this world, we feel <br>quite satisfied and happy and we consider it our duty to <br>remain obliged and devoted to him. Here Allah the Abso- <br>lute Sovereign of both the worlds, is giving the guarantee <br>and is standing surety for the real success after death in <br>return for five times daily salaat, which does not involve <br>much effort on our part. If even then we do not avail of the <br>opportunity, we shall have none to blame, but ourselves for <br>the dreadful doom that awaits us. <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>Ibn Salmaan says that he heard one of the companions <br>of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) nar- <br>rating, \"When we had won the battle of Khaibar, we <br>began to buy and sell among ourselves the booty that <br>had fallen to our lot. One of us went to Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said, '0, Apostle of <br>Allah, no one else has earned so much profit as I have <br>obtained in today's trade.' 'How much did you earn? <br>asked the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). He re- <br>plied, 'I kept on selling and buying till I earned a net <br>profit of three hundred 'Ooqiyyah' of silver.' The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Shall I <br>inform you of something better than that?\" He ex-<br>claimed, 'Do tell me, 0,Prophet of Allah!' The Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked 'Two rakaats <br>nafl after (fardh) salaat.\" <br>Three hundred Ooqiyyahs of silver come to about three <br>thousand rupees. According to the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), the perishable gain of this world stands <br>no comparison with the everlasting gain of the Hereafter. <br>Our life will be pleasant and worth living if we develop our <br>'Imaan' to an extent where two rakaats of salaat, in our <br>sight, are more valuable than all the riches of this world. <br>salaat is really a great treasure and that is why the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of <br>his eyes' and had been enjoining its observance right up to <br>his last breath. Umme Salamah (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that the last words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), which he could hardly utter, were about guard- <br>ing the salaat and kindness towards the slaves. There is a <br>similar hadith narrated by Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>as well. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once deputed <br>in Jihaad a Jamaat towards Najd. They returned victorious <br>very soon with a handsome booty. When the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) saw the people envying them and <br>wondering at their quick and lucrative return, he said to <br>them, \"Shall I inform you of a group of people who earn <br>much more in a much shorter time? They are those who <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>perform their Fajr with Jamaat and keep sitting after prayer <br>till a little while after sunrise and then offer two rakaats of <br>salaat.\" According to Shaqeeq Balkhi, a very famous <br>Shaikh, five things could be acquired through five chan- <br>nels; an increase in provisions through 'Chaasht' a light in <br>the grave through Tahajjud, a very satisfactory answer to <br>Munkar and Nakeer through the recitation of the Qur'an; an <br>easy crossing of Siraat through fasting and alms, and room <br>under the shade of Allah's Throne on the Day of Judgement <br>through seclusion (i.e. Zikr). <br>There are so many sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) enjoining salaat and explaining its <br>virtues that it is very difficult to cover all of them in this <br>small book. A few quotations are, however, reproduced <br>below as a benediction: <br>1. \"Salaat was the first and the foremost thing or- <br>dained by Allah, and it shall be the first and the <br>foremost thing to be reckoned for on the Day of <br>Judgement.\" <br>2. \t \"Fear Allah in the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in <br>the matter of salaat! Fear Allah in the matter of <br>salaat!. <br>3. \t \"SalCat intervenes between man and Shirk.\" <br>4.\t \"Salaat is the mark of Islam. A person who says <br>his salaat at the fixed hours with sincerity and de- <br>votion, observing all its regulations including the <br>Mustahabbaat, is surely a Mo'min.\" <br>5. \t \"Of all things that have been ordained by Allah, <br>Imaan and salaat are the most valued. If there were <br>any otber thing better than salaat, then Allah <br>would have ordained it for His Angels, some of <br>whom are always in ruku and others in sajdah.\" <br>6. \t \"Salaat is the pillar of Islam.\" <br>7. \t \"Salaat abases the Devil.\" <br>8. \t \"Salaat is the light of a Mo'min.\" <br>9. \"Salaat is the best Jihaad.\" <br>10. \t \"Allah keeps relenting towards a person so long as <br>he is engaged in salaat.\" <br>11. \"When a calamity befalls us from the heaven, <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>people frequenting the musjid are spared and <br>saved.\" <br>12. \t \"If some major sins of a Muslim land him in Hell, <br>the fire would not burn those parts of his body <br>which have touched the ground while he was in <br>sajdah during his salaat.\" <br>13. \t \"Fire has been forbidden to touch those parts of <br>the body which touch the ground while perform- <br>ing the sajdah.\" <br>% <br>14. \"Of all the practices, salaat made at fixed hours is 8 <br>5<br>most loved by Allah.\" \t<br>.-<br>L V ~<br>> <br>15. \"Allah likes most the posture of a person when he <br>is in sajdah, pressing his forehead on the ground <br>in humility.\" <br>16. \"A person in sajdah is nearest unto Allah.\" <br>17. \"Sa1aa.t is a key to Paradise.\" <br>18. \"When a person stands in salaat the gates of Par- <br>adise are let open and all the veils between him <br>and Allah are lifted (provided that he spoils not <br>his salaat by coughing etc).\" <br>19. \"A person in salaat (so to say) knocks at the door <br>of the sovereign Lord, and the door is always <br>opened for him who knocks.\" <br>20. \t \"The position of salaat in Islam is as the position <br>of the head in a body.\" <br>21. \t \"Salaat is the light of the heart. Let those who <br>wish enlighten their hearts (through salaat)\". <br>22. \"If \t a person wishes to have his sins forgiven by <br>Allah, he should perform the wudhu properly, <br>offer with devotion two or four rak'aats of fardh or <br>nafl and then pray to Allah. Allah will forgive <br>him.\" <br>23. \t \"Any strip of earth, on which Allah is remem-<br>bered in salaat, takes pride over the rest of the <br>Earth.\" <br>24. \"Allah accepts the prayer of a person who prays to <br>Him after performing two rakaats of salaat. Allah <br>grants him what he prays for, sometimes immedi- <br>ately and sometimes (in his own interest) later.\" <br><br>Virtues of Salaat \t<br>25. \t \"A person who performs two rakaats of salaat in <br>seclusion, where nobody except Allah and His <br>Angels see him, receives a writ of deliverance <br>from the fire of hell.\" <br>26. \t \"Grant of one prayer (wish) becomes due to a <br>person from Allah after each fardh salaat per-<br>formed by him.\" <br>27. \t \"Fire of Hell is forbidden and the Paradise be- <br>comes due to a person who performs his wudhu <br>properly and says his salaat conscientiously, <br>according to its regulations.\" \t<br>28. \t \"The Devil remains scared of a Muslim so long as <br>he is particular about his salaat, but no sooner <br>does he neglect it than the Devil gets a hold upon <br>him and aspires for success in seducing him.\" <br>29. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is the most excellent <br>practice.\" <br>30. \t \"Salaat is the offering of the pious.\" <br>31. \t \"Salaat at its early hours is a practice most liked <br>by Allah.\" \t<br>32. \t \"At dawn, some people go to the musjid and some <br>to the market. Those going to the musjid are the <br>flag-bearers of Imaan and those leaving for the <br>market are the flag-bearers of the Devil.\" <br>33. \t \"The four rakaats before Zuhr have the same <br>reward as the four rakaats of Tahajjud.\" \t<br>34. \t \"The four rakaats before Zuhr are counted equal <br>(in reward) to the four rakaats of Tahajjud.\" <br>35. \t \"Mercy of Allah turns towards a person standing <br>in salaat.\" \t<br>36. \t \"Salaat at the dead of night is most valued, but <br>there are very few who do it.\" <br>37. \t \"Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) came to me and said, <br>0,Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! how- <br>ever long thou livest thou shalt die one day, and <br>whoever, thou may love thou shalt depart from <br>him one day. Surely, thou shalt receive the recom- <br>pense of whatever (good or evil) thou dost.

Do not be weak in <br>g 3<br>offering four rakaats in the early part of the day, <br>for I shall suffice thee in thy jobs in the rest of it.\" <br>Books of hadith are full of discourses on the virtues of <br>salaat, enjoining its observance on all Muslims. The forty <br>short hadiths given above can be memorised and thus the <br>reward of knowing ahaadith in that number can be earned. <br>In fact, salaat is really a big boon, but this is realised only <br>by those who have enjoyed its taste. That is why lile <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to call it the <br>comfort of his eyes and used to spend the major part of the <br>night standing before Allah. For the very same reason, our <br>dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) even on his<br>death-bed charged us and enjoined on us to be particular <br>about salaat. It has been reported in many ahaadith that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would often say, <br>\"Fear Allah concerning salaat.\" Abdullah bin Mas'ood, <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"Of all the practices, <br>salaat is the dearest to me.\" <br>One of the Sahabah narrates, \"One night I happened to <br>go to the musjid. I found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) in salaat. I felt an ardent desire to join him. I made <br>I <br>my intention and stood behind him; he was reciting 'Baqa- <br>rah' at that time. I thought that he would finish the qiraat <br>and go for ruku at the end of the hundredth verse, but he <br>did not do so. Then I thought he would perhaps go to ruku <br>after finishing two hundred verses, but he did not stop <br>even there. I was sure then that he would finish qiyaam <br>with the end of the soorah. When the soorah ended he <br>hymned, 'Allahumma Lakalhamd' (Allah! Thine is all <br>Glory) a number of times and then started 'Aal Imraan'. On <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>finishing that soorah he again hymned 'Allahumma Lakal- <br>hamd' three times and started 'al-Maa'idah'. He went into <br>ruku only after finishing that soorah. In ruku and sajdah <br>he recited tasbeeh and some other prayers, which I could <br>not catch. In the second, rakaat he started 'al-An'aam' after <br>'Fatihah'. I could not continue with him any longer and <br>broke away helplessly.\" What the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) recited in one fakaat comes to about one <br>sixth of the whole Qur'an. Besides, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) must be reciting at ease with proper Taj- <br>weed; we can well imagine how long the rakaat would <br>have been. It was on this account that his feet would often <br>get swollen. But no amount of strain and inconvenience in <br>salaat is in the way of one whose heart is imbued with its <br>sweetness. <br>Abu Ishaaq Subaihi is a famous muhaddith. He died a <br>centenarian. He would often exclaim in his old age, \"Alas! <br>This infirmity and old age have deprived me of the delight <br>of long salaat. I am now only able to recite 'Baqarah' and <br>'Aal-Imraan' in my salaat of two rakaats.\" These two soo- <br>rahs comprise about one eighth of the whole Qur'an. <br>Muhammad bin Sammaak, the famous Soofi, writes, <br>\"My neighbour at Koofah had a son. The boy fasted during <br>the day and kept praying and hymning during the night. <br>This constant strain emaciated him so much that his body <br>was reduced to a skeleton. His father requested me to ad- <br>monish him. Once I was sitting at my door when the boy <br>passed by. He greeted me with 'Assalaamu alaikum' and sat <br>down. I had hardly said anything when he interrupted <br>saying, 'Dear Uncle! Maybe you intend to admonish me to <br>reduce my pursuits. Listen to my story first. I had a few <br>friends in the locality. We decided among ourselves to vie <br>with one another in worship and adoration of Allah. They <br>all applied themselves so hard that they were soon sent for <br>by Allah. They embraced death delightedly and peacefully. <br>Now I am the only one left behind. What will they think of <br>me when they know of my lagging behind? Dear Uncle! My <br>friends really strived very hard and achieved their goal,' He <br>then began to relate the pursuits and accomplishments of <br>his departed friends, which astonished all the listeners. <br>After this he left me. I heard a few days later that the boy <br>too had died (May Allah bless him).\" <br>Even in these days there are persons who remain en- <br>gaged in salaat for the major portion of the night and <br><br>Part I (a)-Importance of Salaat <br>devote the whole day to Tableegh, Ta'leem and other ser- <br>vices in the path of Allah. Maulana Abdul Waahid Lahori <br>(peace be upon him) was a famous saint who lived about <br>two centuries ago. He sighed and wept when he learnt that <br>there was no salaat in Paradise-being the place for recom- <br>pense and not of labour. He remarked, \"How shall we <br>enjoy the Paradise without salaat!\" Such people are really <br>the salt of this Earth. May Allah give us their strength of <br>Imaan and love for His worship! Aameen. <br>Before I finish this chapter, let me reproduce the fol-<br>CI <br>;+ <br>Y,<br>lowing lovely Hadith from Munabbihaat by Ibn Hajar, <br>\"Once when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was <br>$ * <br>sitting among his companions, he remarked, \"Three things <br>of this world are very dear to me: Perfume, Women and sa- <br>laat-the comfort of my eyes.\" \"Quite true\" rejoined Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And I cherish three things: a <br>look at thy face, spending of my wealth on thee and that <br>my daughter is thy wife, 0 Prophet of Allah!\" \"Quite true\", <br>said Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I <br>love most are; enforcing that which is right, forbidding evil <br>and wearing old clothes.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat <br>Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), \"And the three I love most <br>are: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and reciting the <br>Qur'an.\" \"Quite true\", said Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). \"And I love the three things most: serving a guest, <br>fasting on a very hot day and smiting the enemy with my <br>sword.\" At this, Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) appeared on the <br>scene and said to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"Allah has sent me to tell you what I would love if I be one <br>of the mortals.\" \"Yes, do tell us, Jibra-eel\", said the <br>Prophet. jibra-eel then replied, \"If I had been like you, I <br>would have loved three things: guiding the people gone <br>astray, loving those who worship in poverty and helping <br>the poor family men. And as for Allah, He loves three <br>I \t<br>characteristics of His slaves: striving in His Path, crying at <br>the time of repentance, and steadfastness in want and <br>hunger.\" <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim writes: 'Salaat ensures daily bread, <br>promotes health, drives out diseases, strengthens the heart, <br>brings light and beauty on the face, pleases the soul, re- <br>freshes the body, cures indolence, relieves the mind, feeds <br>the soul, illumines the heart and guarantees Allah's favour. <br>It grants protection against Allah's Doom. It keeps the Devil <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>away and brings us nearer to Allah. In short, salaat is a <br>guarantee for all that is desirable and a protection against <br>all that is undesirable for both body and soul, equally in <br>this world and in the Hereafter.\" <br><br>WARNING AND REPROACH FOR NEGLECTING <br>SALAAT <br>The books on hadith mention very severe punishment <br>for those who neglect salaat. From many traditions on the <br>s,ubject, only a few are reproduced in this chapter. <br>Although a single warning from the most truthful Prophet <br>3E j,<br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was enough, yet we find that, grn<br>out of love and mercy for his followers, he has cautioned <br>them again and again and in various manners lest they <br>should neglect salaat and suffer the consequences. In spite <br>of all this, alas! we are unmindful of salaat, and still we <br>have the audacity to consider ourselves devotees of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and champions of <br>Islam. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying: <br>1. \t \"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"To discard salaat is to be linked with Kufr and <br>Shirk.\" <br>3. \t \"Discarding of salaat is the only partition between <br>Imaan and Kufr.\" <br>There are a number of ahaadith on the subject. On one <br>occasion, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said: \"Hurry up with your salaat when it <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>is cloudy (lest you should err and miss the correct time), <br>for to discard salaat is to become a kaafir.\" What a stern <br>warning against even missing the correct time of salaat, as <br>(according to this quotation) to miss the correct time of <br>salaat is to discard it. Although, according to the interpreta- <br>tion of the Ulama, the verdict of kufr is given against a <br>person only when he rejects (and not simply neglects) <br>salaat, yet the words of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) occurring in these ahaadith should be very weighty <br>for those who have any regard for him. It may, however, be <br>noted that some of the very important companions of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) like Umar, Abduilah <br>bin Mas'ood, Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anhum), <br>etc. and eminent jurists like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin <br>Raahwayh, Ibn Mubaarak, (Rahmatullah alaihim). etc. are <br>definitely of the opinion that verdict of kufr can be given <br>against the person who intentionally discards his salaat. <br>May Allah save us! <br>Hadhrat IJbaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates. 'My. dear friend the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) while enjoining upon me seven good prac- <br>tices said, \"Do not ascribe anything as partner to Allah, <br>though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not forego salaat intentionally, lest you <br>should get out of the fold of Islam; do not perpetrate <br>disobedience of Allah, lest you deserve His wrath; and <br>do not take to drinking, for that is the mother of all <br>evils'.\" <br>In another hadith, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"My dear Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>warned me saying, 'Do not ascribe anything as partner unto <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Allah, though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or <br>crucified; do not discard salaat intentionally, as Allah is <br>free from any obligation to a person who knowingly neg- <br>lects salaat; and do not take wine, for that is the key to all <br>vices.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Jabal (Radhiyallaho anho) nar-<br>rates: \"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) en-<br>joined upon me ten things, viz, 'Do not ascribe <br>anything as partner unto Allah, though you may be <br>slain or burnt alive; do not disobey your parents. <br>though you may have to part with your wife or your <br>entire wealth; do not neglect fardh salaat, intention- <br>ally, for Allah is free from obligation to a person who <br>neglects fardh salaat intentionally; do not take wine, <br>for it is an evil habit; that is the root of every uice; do <br>not commit disobedience of Allah, for that brings the <br>wrath of Allah. Do not turn your back to the enemy in <br>battle, though all your comrades may have fallen. Do <br>not fly from the locality where an epidemic has broken <br>out. Do spend on your family members according to <br>your capacity; let your rod be hanging on them, as a <br>warning and to chastise against neglect of their duties <br>towards Allah.\" <br>According to this hadith, we should not spare the roci <br>in checking the children from becoming reckless ih doing <br>anything they like. Sometimes it is necessary to use the <br>rod. It is a pity that out of love we do not use the rod in the <br>beginning and, when the children get spoilt, we cry and <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>complain about them. To spare the rod and to spoil the <br>child is no kindness at all. Who would like to save a child <br>from a surgical operation under advice from a doctor for <br>the simple reason that it would cause pain to him? The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said very often: \"Enjoin salaat on your child when he is <br>seven years old, and beat him if he neglects it after he <br>reaches ten.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) says, \"Guard the salaat of your children and incul- <br>cate good habits in them\". Luqmaan t$e wise used to say, <br>\"The use of the rod on a child is as indispensable as is <br>water for the fields.\" The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"A person while admonish- <br>ing his children earns more reward from Allah than when <br>he is spending about seven pounds of grain in His path.\" In <br>another hadith the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said, \"May Allah bless a person who keeps a lash hang- <br>ing in his house for the admonition of his house-folk.\" On <br>another occasion he said, \"No father can bestow anything <br>better on his children than to teach them good manners.\" <br>Hadhrat Naufil bin Mu'aawiyah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"A person who has missed one <br>salaat is like one who has lost all his family and <br>wealth.\" <br>Salaat is missed usually when either a person is in the <br>company of his family members or is in pursuit of money. <br>According to this hadith, the ultimate loss sustained in <br>missing a salaat is in no way less than the loss of the whole <br>family and property. In other words, if we miss a salaat we <br>should be as much grieved as when we lose all of our folk <br>and entire belongings. If we are cautioned by some reliable <br>person about the presence of gangsters on a certain road, <br>where people are robbed and killed during the night, we <br>need a lion's heart to ignore the caution and travel on that <br>road even during the day time. Strange enough to note that <br><br>Part I (bj-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>we have been cautioned again and again by the Prophet <br>(Sallalaho alaihe wasallam) and we do believe that he was <br>really the true Messenger of Allah, yet we heed not the <br>caution and go on missing salaat one after the other. <br>Hadith V <br>-<br>Icg<br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"A <br>person who combines two salaats without any strong <br>excuse reaches one of the doors of kabaa'ir (major <br>sins).\" <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyellahd anho) reports that the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Do not <br>delay in three things: salaat when its time has set in, burial <br>when the bier is ready and marriage of a solitary woman <br>when her match is found.\" Many persons who consider <br>themselves as practical Muslims perform a number of their <br>salaats in combination on returning home, on the very <br>feeble excuses of travel, trade or occupation. To put salaat <br>off till after its set time without a strong excuse (illness, <br>etc) is a major sin. Although it is not so disastrous as neg- <br>lecting salaat, yet it is quite serious. <br>Hadith VI <br>Abdullah bin Amr (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) while <br>talking about salaat said: \"For its votary, salaat \"shall on <br>the Day of Judgement, be a light for him, an argument <br>in his favour, and a means of his deliverance. Whereas <br>there will be no light, no defence and no deliverance <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from doom for him who does not guard his salaat, and <br>he shall meet the fate of Pharoah, Haamaan and Ubbay <br>bin Khalaf.\" <br>Everybody knows that Pharoah-the big disbeliever-- <br>had been so arrogant that he proclaimed himself 'Lord the <br>Highest' and made his people worship him. Haamaan was <br>his Chief Minister and accomplice. Ubbay bin Khalaf was <br>the most active and severest enemy of Islam among the dis- <br>believers of Mecaa. Before the Hijrah, he used to announce <br>to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) most insolently, <br>\"I have reared a horse, which I feed very well; I will slay <br>you one day riding on its back.\" Once the Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied to him, \"Inshaa-allaah! you <br>shall meet your end at my hands.\" In the battle of Uhud, he <br>ran about in the field in search of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is not slain today, then I stand no chance of sur- <br>viving.\" He at last found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) and advanced to attack him. The Companions <br>decided to finish him before he reached the Prophet, but <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) stopped them. <br>When he came near, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) took a spear from one of the companions and struck <br>him with it, causing a little scratch on his neck. He stag- <br>gered and fell down from his horse and then fled towards <br>his camp crying, \"By Allah, Mtlkammad (SaHallaho alaihe <br>wasalhm) has killed me!\" His people tried to cansole him <br>and told him that it was only a bruise and there was noth- <br>ing to worry h u t ,  but he would say, \"Muhammad (~allal- <br>laho alaihe wasellam) had once announced to me in Mecca <br>that he would kill me. By Allah, had he only spat at me, I <br>would be no more.\" It is said that he cried like a bull. Abu <br>Sufyan, who was very active on that day, put him to shame <br>for crying in that manner over a slight wound, but he said, <br>\"Do you know who has inflicted this injury upon me? It <br>was none other than Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). By Laat and Uzza! if my agony be distributed over all <br>the people of Hijaaz, none of them would survive. Since <br>the time he had declared that he would kill me, I was sure <br>that I would meet my death at his hands. If he only spat at <br>me after that declaration, I would be no more.\" So he died <br>on his way hack, at a day's journey from Mecca. <br>Look! a disbeliever like Ubbay bin Khalaf is so sure <br>about the truth of the Prophet's words that he does not <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>have the slightest doubt about his own death; but where do <br>we stand? Although we believe in him as the greatest <br>Prophet of Allah, consider his words to be most genuine <br>and boast of our love for him, yet how far do we act upon <br>his advice and how much do we fear the punishments <br>about which he has warned us! It is for each one of us to <br>ponder over and answer. <br>Ibn Hajar, while quoting this hadith, has also men- <br>tioned Qaaroon with Pharaoh and others. He writes: \"Shar- <br>ing the fate of these people on the Day of Judgement is due <br>to the fact that it is often the pursuits specific to these <br>guilty persons which cause neglect of salaat. If, therefore, a <br>person neglects salaat due to a craving for wealth, he will <br>meet the fate of Qaaroon; if due to love for power,.then that <br>of Pharaoh; if due to a yearning for attachment to a ruler, <br>then that of Haamaan; and if due to occupation in trade <br>then that of Ubbay Bin Khalaf.\" Meeting the same fate as <br>theirs, explains fully the severest tortures in store for those <br>who neglect salaat. Although the disbelievers shall have to <br>suffer their doom forever, while the believers will be re- <br>leased after their period of punishment is over and will ul- <br>timately be allowed to enter Paradise, yet this period of <br>punishment, who knows, may last for thousands of years. <br>Hadith VII <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>It is said in a hadith that, Allah bestows five favours on <br>a person who is mindful of his salaat, viz: His daily bread <br>is made easy for him; he is saved from the punishments in <br>the grave; he shall receive his record in his right hand on <br>the Day of Judgement; he shall cross the Siraat with the <br>speed of lightning and he shall enter Paradise without reck- <br>oning. As for him who neglects his salaat, he shall meet <br>five types of punishments in this world, three at the time of <br>death, three in the grave and three after resurrection. <br>Those in this world are: he is not blessed in life; he is <br>deprived of the light with which the faces of the righteous <br>are endowed; he receives no rewards for his good practices; <br>his prayers are not answered; and he has no share in the <br>prayers of the pious. Those at the time of death are: he dies <br>disgracefully; he dies hungry; he dies in thirst; which the <br>water in the oceans of the world cannot quench. <br>Those in the grave are: He is so squeezed there that the <br>ribs of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other side; fire <br>is burnt inside for him and he is rolled on cinders day and <br>night; a serpent with fiery eyes and iron nails equal in <br>length to a day's journey is let loose on him and shouts <br>with a thundering voice, 'My Lord has charged me with <br>thrashing you till sunrise for neglecting Fajr, till Asr for <br>neglecting Zuhur, till sunset for neglecting Asr, till Ishaa <br><br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>for neglecting Maghrib and till dawn for neglecting Ishaa. <br>The serpent will keep on thrashing him thus till the Last <br>Day. Each blow pushes him to a depth of seventy arm's <br>length. The punishments will last till the Day of Judge- <br>ment. <br>Those after resurrection are: His reckoning will be a <br>hard one; Allah will be angry with him; and he will be <br>thrown into the Fire. According to one report, he will have <br>following three lines inscribed on his forehead: <br>'0you who neglected Allah's duty' <br>'0you who has deserved Allah's wrath.' <br>'Now despair of Allah's mercy, as you neglected our <br>duty to Allah.' <br>Eminent theologians like Ibn Hajr, Abu Laith Samar- <br>qandi (Rahmatullah alaihim), and others, have mentioned <br>this hadith in their books. Although I have not been able to <br>trace the text in original books on hadith, yet other hadiths, <br>some of which have already been mentioned and some are <br>to follow, corroborate its meaning. Neglect of salaat, as has <br>been stated above, leads one to kufr; hence no punishment <br>is too severe for this offence. But it should be borne in <br>mind that even after the declaration of a person as being <br>guilty, Allah is free to pardon him as and when he pleases. <br>He says in His Holy Book: <br>\"Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be as- <br>cribed unto Him. Allah pardoneth all (save that) whom <br>He will. <br>(IV: 116)\" <br>If then it pleases Allah to pardon anybody neglecting <br>salaat, it will be most fortunate; but who can be sure of this <br>fortune? <br>It is also stated in hadith that there will be three courts <br>to be held by Allah on the Day of Judgement. The first will <br>judge between kufr and islaam and there will be no pardon. <br>The second will be to judge the duties and conduct of one <br>towards another. All aggrieved shall be compensated there; <br>compensation will either be realised from the aggressor or <br>paid by Allah Himself, if He pleases to pardon anybody. <br>The third will deal with duties towards Allah. Here the <br>doors of Allah's mercy will be thrown wide-open and He <br>shall pardon anybody He wills. In the light of all that has <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>been said above, it must be clearly understood that we de- <br>serve the punishments that have been laid down for our <br>commission of sins, but the All-embracing mercy of Allah <br>overrides everything and knows no,bounds. <br>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) to enquire from the companions, just after Fajr, if <br>anybody had seen any dream. He would then interpret the <br>dream as related to him. One day, after enquiring from <br>others as usual, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>himself narrated a long dream in which two men came and <br>took him with them. Besides others he reported certain <br>events which he happened to see in his dream. He said: \"I <br>noticed the head of a person being crushed with a heavy <br>stone. It was struck with such force that, after crushing the <br>head, the stone rolled down over a long distance. The head <br>would assume its normal shape by the time the stone was <br>brought back for repeating the process. This continued in- <br>cessantly. On inquiring from one of my companions, I was <br>told that the person first learnt the Qur'an, but failed to <br>practise upon it and also used to go to sleep without offer- <br>ing the fardh salaat.\" There is another similar narration, in <br>which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>to have seen (in his dream) a group of people being treated <br>likewise. Jiba-eel (Alayhis salaam) informed him on his <br>query that thpse were the persons who used to neglect their <br>salaat. <br>Mujahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"Allah blesses the <br>people who guard their salaat, just as he blessed Hadhrat <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) and his descendants.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"If a <br>person dies with sincere Imaan, observing the command- <br>ments of Allah, performing salaat, and paying Zakaat, <br>when he dies Allah is pleased with him.\" <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Allah says, 'I hold back retribution, deserved by a locality, <br>when I see therein some people who frequently visit the <br>musjid, love one another for My sake, and pray for forgive- <br>ness in the hours of darkness.\" <br>Hadhmt Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) wrote to <br>Hadhrat Salmaan: \"Spend most of your time in the musiid. <br>I have heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"The musjid is the abode of the pious. Allah has <br>taken upon Himself to bless the person who spends most of <br>I <br>I<br>I <br>I <br>I <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>his time in the mosque. Allah shall keep him in comfort <br>and shall make him cross the Siraat with great ease. Surely <br>Allah is pleased with such a person.\" <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"The masaajid are the Houses of Allah, and <br>people coming therein are His visitors. When everybody <br>treats his visitors kindly, why should Allah not be kind to <br>His guests?\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"Allah loves the person who is attached to the <br>musjid.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"When a dead person is laid in the grave, even <br>before the people present at his burial clear off, Munkar <br>and Nakeer visit him. Then, if the person is a Mo'min, his <br>good practices encircle him; salaat comes close to his head, <br>Zakaat to his right. Fast to his left, and the remaining good <br>deeds towards his feet, so that none can approach him. <br>Even the angels do the necessary questioning while stand- <br>ing at a distance.\" <br>One of the companions reports that, when the inmates <br>of the Prophet's house were hard-pressed in any way, he <br>would enjoin salaat on them and recite the following verse: <br>\"And enjoin salaat upon thy people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision, We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for the righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) narrates that she heard the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, \"All the <br>people will be gathered together on the Day of Judgement <br>and they will all hear the voice of the announcing angel. <br>He will say, 'where are those who glorified Allah in ease <br>and adversity?' A group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. It will then be announced, 'where are <br>those who forsook their beds and spent their nights in <br>worship?' Another group will rise up and enter Paradise <br>without reckoning. The angel will again announce, 'where <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>are those whom trade and business did not distract from re- <br>membrance of Allah?\" Yet another group will rise up and <br>enter Paradise.' In another hadith, the same account is <br>given, with the addition that in the beginning the angel <br>will say. \"All those gathered here will see today who are <br>the honoured people\", and with the modification that the <br>angel at the time of third announcement will say, 'Where <br>are those whom their engagement in trade and business did <br>not distract from salaat and remembrance of Allah?\" <br>Sheik Nasr Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih), after <br>quoting this Hadith writes, \"When all the three groups will <br>have entered Paradise without reckoning, a monster with a <br>long neck. shining eyes and most eloquent tongue will rise <br>up from Hell and say. 'I have been deputed on all who are <br>proud and ill-tempered.' It will then pick up all such per- <br>sons from the crowd, as a fowl picks up grain and then it <br>will fling them into the Hell. It will rise up again saying, <br>'This time i have been deputed on all who maligned Allah <br>and His Apostle' (Sallallaho alaihe wassallam).' It will then <br>pick up all such persons and throw them into the Hell; it <br>will appear for the third time and will, in a similar manner, <br>take away all those who made images and pictures. The <br>reckoning will then commence after these three groups <br>have been eliminated.\" <br>It is said that during the early times people could see <br>Satan. A person approached him saying how could he be <br>like him. Satan told him that had he never received such a <br>request before and asked hin? what had prornpted him to <br>ask for it. The person told him that he wished it from his <br>heart. Satan told him to neglect his salaat and to swear very <br>frequently, not caring whether he was doir~g it truthfully. <br>The person told Satan that he would swear by Allah never <br>to give up salaat and swear falsely. Satan told him that <br>never before he had been tricked by a human being to seek <br>his advice. He was determined never to do so in future. <br>Xadhrat Ubayv (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Give glad tidings to the Muslims that they shall be hon- <br>oured and exalted, and their religion shall prevail, but <br>there is no portion in the Hereafter for those who exploit <br>Islam for wordlv gains.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"I saw Allah in His best form. He said to me, '0 <br>'Muhammad! what are the Highest Chiefs (Angels) arguing <br>about'?' I said, 'I have no knowledge about that.' Allah <br>i<br>I <br>, <br>l <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>placed His gracious hand on my bosom. I felt its solacing <br>coolness right through my heart, and the entire universe <br>was revealed to me. I said. 'They are arguing about the <br>things which exalt, the things which atone for the sins, the <br>rewards for the paces taken while going for salaat (with <br>Ja~naat),the virtues of performing wudhu properly when it <br>was very cold, and the blessings that a person deserves <br>when after performing one salaat he keeps on sitting in <br>musjid till the next salaat.' A person particular of these <br>shall live a blessed life and shall die an enviable death.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported <br>(in many ahaadith) to have said, \"Allah says, '0, Son of <br>Aadam! Say four rakaats of salaat in the early part of the <br>day. I shall help thee in accomplishing all thy jobs during <br>the rest of the day.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"Salaat is the cause of Allah's <br>pleasure, is loved by the Angels, is a tradition of the Proph- <br>ets, gives enlightenment about Allah, causes the prayers to <br>be granted, blesses the daily bread, is the root of Imaan, re- <br>freshes the body, is a weapon against the enemy, shall in- <br>tercede for its adherent, is a light in the darkness and a <br>companion in the loneliness of the grave, is a reply to the <br>questioning of Angels, is a shade against the Sun on the <br>Day of Judgement, is a protection against the fire of Hell, is <br>a weight for the scales of good deeds, is a means of swift <br>crossing over the Siraat arid is a key to Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Uthmarl (Radhiyallaho anho) is reported to <br>have said. \"Allah bestows nine fdvours on a person who <br>guards his salaat and is particular in performing it at its ap- <br>pointed hours: viz; He is loved by Allah, he enjoys good <br>health, is constantly under the protection of angels, his <br>home is blessed, the light of righteousrless shines on his <br>face, his heart is made soft, he shall cross the Siraat with <br>the speed of lightning, he is saved from Hell, and his neigh- <br>bours in Paradise are those about whom Allah has said. <br>'There shall be no fear come upon them, neither shall <br>they grieve (11: 36). <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Salaat <br>is the Pillar of Islam and it has ten virtues, viz: It is a charm <br>of the face, a light of the heart, health and refreshment for <br>the bodv, a companv in the grave, a means for the descent <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>of Allah's Mercy, a key to the Heaven, a weight of the <br>scales (of good deeds) a means of winning Allah's pleasure, <br>a price of Paradise and a protection against the fire of Hell. <br>A person who is particular of salaat, in fact, establishes <br>deen and one who neglects it demolishes (so to say, the <br>structure of) deen.\" <br>According to one hadith, there is healing in salaat. <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saw Hadhrat <br>Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) lying on his stomach. <br>He said to him, \".Are you suffering from stomach pain?\" He <br>replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) said, \"Then get up and busy yourself in salaat, <br>for that will heal you.\" <br>Once the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), in his <br>dream, saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadhrat <br>Bilaal (Radhiyallaho anha) there. Next morning he said to <br>Bilaal: What deed of yours helped you to follow me even to <br>Paradise?\" He replied: \"When my wudhu breaks even at <br>night, I take a fresh wudhu and say as many 'rakaats' of <br>nafl salaat as I can.\" <br>Safeeri (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"The Angels ad- <br>dress a person who misses Fajr as '0 you wrongdoer', and <br>one who neglects Zuhr as '0 you loser', and one who ig- <br>nores Asr as '0 you transgressor', and one who omits <br>Maghrib as '0 you kaafir', and one who does not say Ishaa <br>as '0you violator of Allah's commandments.\" <br>Alama Sha'raani (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: \"It should <br>be clearly understood that a calamity is drawn off from a <br>locality the people of which are particular about salaat, <br>whereas a locality the people of which neglect salaat is fre- <br>quently visited by calamities. Earthquakes, thunderbolts <br>and sinking of houses are not unexpected where people are <br>not particular about salaat. Simply guarding one's own <br>salaat is not enough, because when a calamity strikes, it <br>does not befall the wrongdoers alone. It affects everybody <br>in that locality. Once the Sahabah asked the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Can we perish while there are <br>pious people among us?\" the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) replied, \"Yes, if vice becomes predominant.\" It <br>is therefore necessary that other people should also be en- <br>joined to stick to Allah's commandments and refrain from <br>wrongdoing. <br><br>Part I (b)- Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>Hadith VIII <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"A person neglecting his salaat (even <br>though he makes it up later) shall remain in Hell for a 2 * <br>period of one Haqb. A Haqb is equal to eighty years of <br>three hundred and sixty days each, and a day in the <br>g z<br>Hereafter shall equal one thousand years of this <br>T <br>world.\" <br>Abul Laith Samarqandi (Rahmatullah alaih) is respon- <br>sible for the lladith in which the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said, \"The name of a person <br>who neglects even a single fardh salaat intentionally is <br>written on the gate of the Hell, which he must enter.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that .once <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Pray, 0 <br>Allah! cause not any one of us to be a wretched destitute.'? <br>He then said: \"Do you know who is a wretched destitute?\" <br>At the'request of the companions, he explained to them <br>saying, \"A wretched destitute is he who neglects his salaat. <br>In Islaam there is nothing for him.\" In another hadith it is <br>said, \"Allah will not care a bit for the person who has been <br>neglecting salaat intentionally, and for him shall be an <br>awful doom.\" <br>It is reported in a hadith that ten persons will be <br>specially tormented, and one of them will be the person <br>who neglects his salaat. It is said that his hands will be tied <br>while the angels shall smite him on his face and back. Par- <br>adise will tell him, 'In me there is no room for you,' and <br>Hell will sav to him, 'Come to me. You are for me and I am <br>for you.' It is also reported that there is a valley in Hell <br>named Lamlam. This vallev is infested with serpents as fat <br>as the neck of a camel and as long as one month's journey. <br>A person neglecting salaat shall be tormented in this <br>valley. 111 another hadith, it is reported that there is a vale <br>in the Hell. which is krlown as the Pit of Grief; it is infested <br>with scorpions of the size of a mule. This place is also <br>meant for tormenting the people who neglect salaat. Of <br>course, there is nothing to worry if the most merciful Allah <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>pardons the sins. But are we really prepared to ask for His <br>pardon? <br>Ibn Hajar writes, \"A woman died. Her brother was pres- <br>ent at her burial. By chance his purse fell into the grave <br>and was buried with the dead body. The brother realized <br>this after he had returned home and was very sorry for the <br>loss. He decided to dig up the grave secretly and take out <br>the purse. When he dug it up, he saw that the pit was in <br>flames. He returned home, stricken with grief, and related <br>the story to his mother, and inquired if she knew why it <br>was so. The mother informed him that his sister used to <br>delay in salaat and offered it after its fixed hours. May <br>Allah save us from these habits! <br>Hadith IX <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying: \"There is no place in Islaam for a person who <br>does .not say his salaat, and there is no salaat without <br>wudhu.\" Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) also heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying. \"There is no Islaam in a person when <br>there is no salaat by him. The position of salaat in <br>Islaam is as the position of the head in a body.\" <br>Let those who do not offer salaat, and not onlv call <br>themselves Muslims, but also boast of their being cham- <br>pions of the Muslim cause, ponder over these words of the <br>Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). They dream of <br>reviving the past glory of Islaam. but would not care to <br>know how rigidly the people responsible for that glory <br>stuck to the practices of Islaam. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhivallaho anho) suf- <br>fered from cataract of the eve. People told him that the dis- <br>ease could be treated, but he would have to miss his salaat <br>for a few days. He said: \"This is not possible; I have heard <br>Part I (b)-Warning on Discard of Salaat <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, 'A person <br>who does not say his salaat shall stand before Allah while <br>Allah shall be angry with him.\" The companions of the <br>Prophet would rather like to go blind than to forego salaat <br>(though permissible under such circumstances) even for a <br>few days. When on his last day Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) was stabbed by a Majoos, he often remained un- <br>conscious and eventually died due to excessive bleeding. <br>While on his death-bed, he was made conscious of the ap- <br>proaching salaat hours and he performed salaat in that very <br>condition, and would remark: \"There is no lot in Islaam for <br>a person who does not say his salaat.\" These days it is con- <br>sidered unkind and improper to induce the patient or even <br>T <br>allow him to say his salaat. What a world of difference is <br>there between the view-points and approach of the Mus- <br>lims of these two ages! <br>Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho. anho) once requested the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him a servant. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Here are <br>three slaves; take any one you like.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) said, \"You may kindly choose one for me.\" The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) pointed towards a cer- <br>tain man and said, \"Take this one; he is particular about <br>his salaat. But you are not to beat him. We are forbidden to <br>beat one who says salaat.\" We, on the other hand, mock at <br>our servant and consider him a liability if he goes for <br>salaat. <br>Sufyaan 'rhauri (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous Soofi <br>once fell into a state of ecstasy. He remained in his house <br>for seven days without sleep, food and drink. When his <br>Shaikh was informed of his condition, he inquired if Su- <br>fyaan was observing the hours of his salaat. He was told <br>that his salaat was quite regular and safe. At this, the <br>Shaikh remarked, \"Glory be to Allah, Who has not allowed <br>the Devil to have an upper hand on him! \" <br><br>PART I1 <br>IMPORTANCE OF JAMAAT <br>As has already been said in tne foreword, there are many <br>who say their salaat regularly but are not very particular <br>about Jamaat. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>as emphatic in enjoining Jamaat as he is particular about <br>salaat. This part also consists of two chapters. The first <br>deals with the rewards of Jamaat and the second with the <br>consequences of its neglect. <br>CHAPTER I <br>REWARDS OF JAMAAT <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Umar (Radhiyallaho anha) nar- <br>rates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) saying: \"A salaat with Jamaat is twenty-seven <br>times superior to salaat performed individually.\" <br>When we offer our salaat for getting reward from <br>Allah, then why should it not be done in the musjid, where <br>the reward earned is twenty-seven times more. Nobody <br>will be so unwise as to forego a profit twenty-seven times <br>greater with simply a little extra labour. But we are so in- <br>different about the profits promised for our religious prac- <br>tices! This can be due to nothing but our disregard for deen <br>and the rewards of it. It is a pity that we apply ourselves so <br>hard to acquiring the trifling gains in this material world; <br>but are so unmindful of the gains in the Hereafter, which <br>yield twenty-seven times more with a little extra effort. We <br>often argue that for going to the musjid for Jamaat we have <br>to close the shop and will thus lose business. These pre- <br>texts and others of the kind cannot stand in the way of <br>those who have perfect faith in the Greatness of Allah, and <br><br>Part I1 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>28 <br>in His word; and who realize the value of the blessings and <br>reward in the Hereafter. It is in respect of such people that <br>Allah says: <br>\"Men, whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth <br>then from remembrance of Allah and constancy in <br>salaat.\" <br>(XXIV;37). <br>It is said of Saalim Haddaad (Rahmatullah alaih] (a .-,-<br>trader and a great Soofi) that on hearing Azaan he would <br>g 2<br>turn pale and grow restless. He would stand up immedi- .Ez<br>ately, leaving his shop open and recite these couplets:- <br>><br>1. \"When Thy summoner stands up to summon, <br>quickly I stand up. <br>To respond to (the summons of) The Mighty Lord <br>Who hath no peer.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"I reply to the summons with complete submis- <br>sion and cheer, 'Here am I, 0 Bountiful One.\" <br>3. \t<br>\"My face grows pale with awe and fear, and occu- <br>pation in Thee distracts me from all other occupa- <br>tions.\" <br>4. <br>\"I swear by Thee, naught is dear to me save Thy <br>remembrance. <br>Nothing is more ravishing for me than Thy sweet <br>name.\" <br>5. \t \"0,will th'ere be a time for us to be together? <br>A lover is happy only when he is with his love.\" <br>6. \"He whose eyes have seen the light of Thy Beauty <br>Can never be solaced. He must die yearning for <br>Thee.\" <br>It is said in a hadith: \"People frequenting the musjid <br>are its pegs (dwellers). Angels are their companioris and <br>visit them when they are sick and help them when they are <br>at their jobs.\" <br>Hadith I1 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>\"Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Salaat with Jamaat is twenty-five times <br>superior to salaat which is said in a house or in a shop. <br>It is so because when a person performs wudhu in <br>right earnest and walks on to the musjid, with the sole <br>intention of performing salaat, each step he takes, adds <br>one blessing to his account and wipes out one sin <br>therefrom. Again, if he keeps sitting in the musjid <br>(with wudhu of course) after the salaat is over, the <br>angels keep on seeking Allah's blessing and forgive- <br>ness for him. And as long as he keeps sitting in the <br>musjid waiting for salaat, he goes on earning rewards <br>as if he is busy in salaat.\" <br>In Hadith No. I, the superiority of salaat with Jamaat <br>over that offered individually is described as being twenty- <br>seven times more, while this hadith mentions only twenty- <br>five times. Various theologians have discussed at length <br>this seeming inconsistency. The following are some of the <br>explanations: <br>1. \t \"This variation from twenty-five to twenty-seven <br>is due to variation of ikhlaas (sincerity) in differ- <br>ent individuals.\" <br>2. \t<br>\"In Sirri (quiet) salaat (i.e., Zuhr and Asr), it is <br>twenty-five times, while in Jahri (loud) salaat (i.e., <br>Fajr, Maghrib and Ishaa), it is twenty-seven <br>times.\" <br>3. \t \"In Fajr and Ishaa, when it is somewhat incon- <br>venient to go out due to cold and darkness, it is <br>twenty-seven times, but in other salaats it is <br>twenty-five times.\" <br>4. \t \"In the beginning it was twenty-five times, but <br>subsequently Allah (by special favour on the fol- <br>lowers of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>raised the reward to twenty-seven times.\" <br>1 <br>I <br>Part 11 (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Some others have brought forward a still finer explana- <br>tion. They say that the reward for salaat with Jamaat men- <br>tioned in this Hadith is not merely 25 times but a doubling <br>(2 raised to the power) twenty-five times, which comes to <br>33,554,432times. This is something not beyond the bounti- <br>ful Mercy of Allah. When neglect of one salaat can cause <br>punishment in Hell for one Huqb (as we have seen in the <br>last chapter), so much reward for one salaat with Jamaat is <br>quite conceivable. <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has also ex- <br>plained to us how the reward goes on increasing in the case <br>of a person who, after~erforming wudhu, leaves his house <br>with the sole intention of joining Jamaat for salaat in the <br>musjid. Each step he takes, brings one reward as well as <br>washes away one sin. Banu Salama, a clan in Madina, had <br>their houses at some distance. They intended to shift close <br>to the musjid. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>however, advised them saying: \"Stay where you are. Every <br>step you take when coming to musjid is written in your <br>account.\" It is said in a hadith: \"The likeness of a person <br>performing wudhu at home and then leaving for musjid is <br>as the likeness of of a person who, after dressing in the <br>ihraam (Hajj apparel) at his house, leaves for Hajj\". <br>Further, in the same hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) points to another act of great value; i.e., as <br>long as one remains sitting in musjid after the salaat is <br>over, the angels pray for him asking for forgiveness and <br>mercy. The angels are the innocent and holy creation of <br>Allah. So, the effectiveness of their prayers is self-evident. <br>Muhammad bin Samaak (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous theologian and Sheikh. He died at the age of one <br>hundred and three. He used to perform two hundred <br>rakaats of nafl salaat daily. He writes: \"For forty years, I <br>never _missed the first takbeer of salaat with Jamaat, except <br>once when my mother had died.\" The same Shaikh writes: <br>\"Once I missed the Jamaat. As I knew that salaat with <br>Jamaat was twenty-five times superior, I repeated this <br>salaat (individually) twenty-five times to make up the loss. <br>I heard in my dream some one saying to me, 'Muhammad! <br>You have repeated your salaat 25 times (in the hope of <br>making good the loss), but what about the 'Aameen' by the <br>Angels?\" It is reported in many ahaadith that when the <br>Imaam says 'Aameen' after Fatihah, the Angels also say <br>Aameen and all the past sins of a person whose Ameen <br>coincides with that of the Angels are forgiven. This is <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>possible only in a salaat with Jamaat, hence Maulana <br>Abdul Hayy quoting this story about the Shaikh writes: <br>\"Even if a person goes on repeating his salaat (individ- <br>ually) a thousand times, he cannot get the collective bless- <br>ing of a salaat with Jamaat.\" This is obvious. He not only <br>loses 'Aameen' with the Angels, but also the blessings of <br>the congregation and the prayers of the Angels after salaat, <br>with many other spiritual benefits. This should also be <br>borne in mind that the prayers of Angels can be deserved <br>only when the salaat is a proper one. If the salaat qf a <br>person is not, as it should be (according to hadith) it is <br>flung back like a dirty rag at his face, then how can the <br>Angels pray for him? <br>Hadith 111 <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Masood (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says: \"If one wishes to meet Allah on the Day of Judge- <br>ment as a Muslim, he must say his salaat at a place <br>where Azaan is called out, viz., a musjid, as Allah has <br>prescribed through His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) such practices which are nothing but guid- <br>ance through and through: and salaat (with Jamaat) is <br>one of them. If you start saying your salaat at your <br>houses (as.so and so is doing), then vou will be dis-<br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jarnaat <br>carding the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and no sooner you desert his Sunnah than <br>you go astray. When a person performs wudhu cor-<br>rectly and then leaves for the musjid, at each step that <br>he takes, he gets one blessing and has one sin wiped <br>out. During the lifetime of the Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) no one would miss Jamaat except an <br>open munaafiq or a real invalid. Even the munaafiq <br>dared not miss the Jamaat and a sick person who could <br>be taken to the musjid with the help of two men would <br>be helped to join Jamaat.\" <br>0 ,  <br>CA a <br>o3<br>a<br>This shows the extreme vigilance of the Sahabah over <br>their salaat with Jamaat. Even a sick person was brought to <br>S <br>the musjid somehow or other, even though it needed two <br>men to help him. This concern was quite natural when <br>they found the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) him- <br>self so very particular about it. It is said that when the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was on his deathbed, <br>and he would frequently faint, he succeeded in making <br>wudhu after several attempts and, though he could hardly <br>stand, went to the musjid with the help of Hadhrat Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) and another companion. Hadhrat Abu <br>Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) led the salaat at his instance, and <br>he himself joined the Jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to him, <br>\"Worship your Lord as if you see Him before you, count <br>yourself among the dead, beware of the curse of the <br>wronged ones and, even if you could crawl to the musjid, <br>do not miss Ishaa and Fajr with Jamaat.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"Ishaa and Fajr are very <br>heavy on those who are munaafiq. If they knew the reward <br>of the Jamaat, they would go to the musjid and join the <br>Jamaat even if they had to crawl.\" <br>Hadith IV <br>Hadhrat Anas bin Maalik (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>saying, \"A person who in all sincerity is constant in <br>his salaat with Jamaat for forty days, without missing <br>the first takbeer, recieves two awards: one for deliv- <br>erance from Hell and the ~ t h e r  for freedom from <br>nifaaq.\" <br>If a person is regular in his salaat (with sincerity) for <br>forty days and joins the Jamaat from the very start (i.e., <br>when the Imaam calls out his first takbeer), then he shan <br>neither be a munaafiq nor shall he go to Hell. A munaafiq <br>is a person who feigns being a Muslim, but there is kufr in <br>his heart., Genesis of man (according to hadith) takes place <br>in periods of forty days. This seems to be the significance <br>of forty days in this hadith, and so the Soofis attach import- <br>ance to this period (called Chillah in Urdu) for purposes of <br>spiritual discipline. <br>Lucky indeed are the persons who do not miss their <br>first takbeer for years together. <br>Hadith V <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who performs wudhu scrupulously, <br>and then goes to the musjid and finds that Jamaat is <br>over, receives a reword equal to that of Jamaat. This <br>would not diminish anything from the reward of those <br>who have actually performed their salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>This is indeed Allah's great favour and beneficence <br>that the mere effort and a slight exertion is enough to en- <br>title us to a reward of Jamaat, though actually we fail to <br>join it. Who is the loser then if we ourselves get left, and <br>miss the bounties of the most Bountiful? <br>This hadith also shows that we-should not postpone <br>going to the musjid in apprehension of the Jamaat being <br>over. Even if we find on reaching the musjid that Jamaat is <br>over, we will still get the reward thereof. If, however, we <br>are certain that the Jamaat is already over, then there is of <br>course no idea in going to the musjid for Jamaat. <br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>Hadith VI <br>Hadhrat Qubaath bin Ashyam Allaithi (Radhiyallaho <br>% * <br>anho) narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) saying, \"Two persons performing salaat together <br>-g3<br>with one as Imaam are liked by Allah more than four per- <br>+ <br>sons saying salaat individually. Similarly four persons per- <br>forming salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah more than <br>eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again, eight <br>persons performing salaat with Jamaat are liked by Allah <br>more than one hundred persons saying it individually.\" <br>In another hadith it is said, \"A big Jamaat is more pre- <br>fered by Allah than a small Jamaat.\" Some people think <br>that there is no harm in having a small Jamaat of their own <br>at their houses or at their business premises. This is not <br>correct, as in the first place they are deprived of the reward <br>of saying salaat in the musjid and secondly, they lose the <br>blessing of salaat with a big Jamaat. The bigger the congre- <br>gation, the more pleasing it is to Allah. When our sole dim <br>is to achieve the pleasure of Allah, why should we not <br>adopt a manner more pleasing to Him. It is reported in a <br>hadith that Allah is pleased to see three things, namely, a <br>row of worshippers offering salaat with Jamaat, a persor, <br>busy in salaat at the time of Tahajjud at the dead of night, <br>and a person fighting in the way of Allah.\" <br>Hadith VII <br>Hadhrat Sahl bin Sa'd (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"Give glad tidings to those who go to the <br>musjid frequently during hours of darkness, for they <br>will have perfect light on the Day of Judgement.\" <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>The value of going to .the musjid in the darkness of <br>night shall be realised on the dreadful Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody shall be in a very miserable plight. A <br>person subjecting himself to inconvenience in the hours of <br>darkness in this world shall be more than compensated in <br>the next, as he shall carry with him a light more glorious <br>than that of the sun. In a hadith it is reported that such per- <br>sons shall occupy the pulpits of light, with no worry at all, <br>while others will be in utter bewilderment. In another <br>hadith it is said, \"Allah will say on the Day of Judgement, <br>Where are My neighbours?\" The Angels wi!l inquire, \"Who <br>are Thy neighbours, 0 Allah?'. Allah will reply, 'Those <br>who used to frequent the mosques.\" <br>In a hadith it is said, \"Of all the places on this Earth, <br>the mosques are the dearest to Allah, and the markets are <br>the most offensive to Hirn.\" <br>In another hadith, the 'masaajid' are called \"The gar- <br>dens of Paradise.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, <br>\"The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, 'Bear <br>testimony to the Imaan of the person frequenting the <br>musjid, and then he recited the following verse of the <br>Qur'an' <br>\"He only shall tend Allah's musjid who believes in <br>Allah and the L,ast Day.\" <br>(IV:18).\" <br>The following are a few more ahaadith about the vir- <br>tues of salaat with Jamaat:- <br>1. \t \"Making wudhu when inconvenient, walking to- <br>wards 'the musjid and sitting there (after one <br>salaat), waiting for the next salaat, wipe out the <br>sins.\" <br>2. \t \"The farther a person lives from the 'musjid' the <br>greater the hlessing he receives.\" This is so be- <br>cause a person coming from a distance shall have <br>to walk more and, as already mentioned, every <br>step will fetch him a blessing. For this very reason <br>some companions have been reported to be taking <br>short steps in going to the musjid in order to earn <br>more blessings. <br>3. \t<br>\"There are three things in this world for which <br><br>Part II (a)-Rewards of Jamaat <br>people would fight with one another if they come <br>to know their rewards. These are: To call out the <br>Azaan; to go to the musjid for Zuhr in the scorch- <br>ing heat of the sun; and to be in the first line while <br>in salaat with Jamaat.\" <br>4. \t<br>\"Seven persons shall be accommodated under the <br>shade of Allah's mercy on the Day of Judgement, <br>when everybody will be most bewildered under <br>the inconceivably intense heat of the sun. One of <br>them will be the person whose heart remains <br>-<br>attached to the musjid. He is anxious to return to 3:<br>the musjid if he leaves it on any account. Another <br>h m  <br>hadith narrates that Allah loves those who love <br>the musjid.\" <br>Each article of faith in Islam is a source of innumerable <br>blessings and rewards from Allah, and carries boundless <br>benefits showered on those who adhere to it. Besides, no <br>commandment of Allah is without a deep significance. It is <br>often difficult to understand the full benefits of Allah's <br>commandments, as no one can encompass His Knowledge <br>and Wisdom. Some of the sages of Islam have tried to <br>explain the importance of salaat with Jamaat, but their <br>explanations vary with the extent of their understanding <br>and their power to probe into Divine secrets. Our respected <br>Shaikh, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (may Allah illumine his <br>grave), in his famous Book 'Hujjatullahil Balighah' <br>writes:-<br>\"To save the people from the fatal effects that their <br>own customs and rituals can bring them, there is nothing <br>more useful than to make one of the religious services so <br>common a custom and so public a ritual that it may be per- <br>formed openly before everybody by any person, whether he <br>be learned or illiterate. The town-folk and the countrymen <br>should both be equally anxious to observe it. It should <br>become a subject of rivalry and pride among all of them, <br>and ~t should be so universally practised that it becomes <br>part and parcel of their social set-up, so much so, that life <br>without it may be worthless for them. If this is achieved, it <br>will help in establishing the worship and obedience of <br>Allah and will form a very useful substitute for those <br>rituals and customs which could cause them serious harm. <br>Since salaat is the only religious observance that surpasses <br>all others in importance and universality, both in reason <br>and authority, it becomes therefore absolutely necessary to <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>get it established universally by propagating it and by <br>arranging special congregations, where it can be performed <br>with absolute unity of form and purpose.\" <br>\"Further, in every community or religious society. <br>There are a few who have the capacity to lead, while the <br>rest simply follow. There are some others who can be cor- <br>rected with a little counsel or reproach. Then there is a <br>third grade of people who are very weak in faith and, if <br>they are not made to worship in public, they are prone to <br>discard it altogether. It is therefore in the best interests of <br>the Islamic society that all its members perform the <br>worship collectively and in congregation, so that the delin- <br>quents may be distinguished from the observers and the <br>shirkers from the adherents. This will also cause the people <br>with less knowledge to follow the Ulama, and make the ig- <br>norant to learn from the learned the specific requirements <br>of worship. The worshipper will distinguish right from <br>wrong and genuine from counterfeit, so that the right and <br>the genuine may prevail and the wrong and the counterfeit <br>may be suppressed.\" <br>\"Besides, these congregations of people loving Allah, <br>seeking His Mercy, constantly fearing Him and having their <br>hearts and souls turned to Him alone, have the wonderful <br>effect of causing His blessings and Mercy to descend from <br>Heaven. <br>\"Moreover, the Muslim community has been raised so <br>that the word of Allah be held supreme and Islamic Order <br>be paramount over all others. This object cannot be <br>achieved unless all Muslims, big and small, the elite and <br>the common, the town folk and the countrymen, perform <br>alike the most sublime service and the most sacred ritual of <br>Islam (i.e., salaat) by assembling together in one place. It is <br>for this reason that the Sharee-at (Islamic Law) lays such <br>special stress on Friday congregation and on salaat with <br>jamaat, by explaining the blessings that accrue therefrom <br>and punishments awarded for neglect 1 lereof. For the open <br>and conspicuous observance of this im?ortant service, two <br>types of assemblies are required: one fr~rpeople of a clan or <br>a particular locality and the other for the people of the <br>whole town. Since the assembly or\" the former at any hour <br>is convenient and that of the latte, comparatively difficult, <br>so for the former, the gathering for salaat (with jamaat) five <br>times daily, has been laid down and in the case of the latter <br>gathering, the weekly Friday salaat has been devised and <br>ordained.\" <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>REPROACH ON GIVING UP JAMAAT <br>Just as Allah has promised rewards and blessings for <br>adhering to His commandments, so has He warned us of <br>the woeful consequences and punishments for their neg- <br>lect. We are in bondage to Allah and as such it is obligatory <br>on us to obey Him. No compensation or reward is due to us <br>for our obedience to Him. If He gives a reward, it is surely a <br>matter of His extreme favour on us. Similarly no punish- <br>ments can be too much for us if we disobey Him-our Lord, <br>for their can be no greater crime for a bondsman than to <br>disobey his Master. Hence no warning or premonition was <br>required to be imparted. Yet Allah and His Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) have so very kindly cautioned <br>us in various ways, warned us frequently of the conse-<br>quences and explained to us again and again, just to save <br>us from disaster. If even then, we don't take a lesson, who <br>collld there be to save us from the inevitable consequences? <br>Hadith I <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates, \"I <br>heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"If a person in spite of hearing the azaan does not go to <br>the musjid (and he prefers to say his salaat at home) <br>without a strong excuse, then his salaat is not ac-<br>cepted. When the Companions inquired as to what <br>could be a strong excuse, he replied, \"Illness or fear.\" <br>It may perhaps appear from this Hadith that the salaat <br>performed at home (after hearing the Azaan) is no salaat at <br>all; the Hanafiyyah do not hold this view. According to <br>them, though the reward and blessings promised for fardh <br>salaat will not be awarded, yet the person saying the salaat <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>at his place does absolve himself of the obligation. But in <br>the opinion of some of the companions and their success- <br>ors, salaat with jamaat (after hearing the Azaan) is fardh <br>and its discard is haraam. According to many other theo- <br>logians, such a person is not even absolved of the obliga- <br>tion in respect of salaat of that hour. Anyhow, he is surely <br>committing the sin of discarding jamaat. In another hadith <br>narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, it is stated that such a <br>person is guilty of disobedience of Allah and his Apostle <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) also says, \"No good is done by, nor any good is <br>done to, the person who does not join jamaat after hearing <br>the Azaan. Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says, \"It is more appropriate to pour molten-lead into the <br>ears of a person who does not go to join jamaat.\" <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz bin Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"A person who does not go for salaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is committing a great wrong and is doing <br>an act of kufr and nifaaq.\" <br>According to this hadith, not to join jamaat after hear- <br>ing the Azaan is not becoming of a Muslim and is the prac- <br>tice of a kaafir or a munaafiq. What a strong reproof! <br>In another hadith, it is said, \"Not to join jamaat after <br>hearing the Azaan is sufficient to render a person most un- <br>fortunate and most wretched.\" <br>Hadhrat Sulaimaan bin Abi Hathmah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) is one of the eminent people of the early days of <br>Islam. He was born during the lifetime of the Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), but was too young then to have <br>had the honour of listening to any hadith from him. During <br>the Caliphate of Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyaliaho anho) he was <br>made in charge of the market. One day Hadhrat Umar (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) found him missing in Fajr salaat. Hadhrat <br>Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) went to his house and inquired <br>from his mother why Sulaimaan was not present in Fajr. <br>She replied, \"He kept saying nafl salaat throughout the <br>Part I1 (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jamaat <br>night, and sleep overpowered him at the time of Fajr.\" At <br>this, Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked \"I <br>would prefer my Fajr with jamaat to my offering nafl salaat <br>all night long.\" <br>- -a<br>.\"+<br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge <br>quantity of firewood for me, and then I would go <br>around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say <br>their salaat at their own houses without any excuse.\" <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was <br>most kind and merciful towards his followers and was <br>greatly pained to see them even in a little trouble, gets of- <br>fended so much that he is ready to set fire to the houses of <br>those who are content with saying salaat at their houses. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>saying, \"If there are (even) three persons in a village or <br>in a desert, and they do not say their salaat with <br>jamaat, then Satan gets hold of them. Remember that <br>jamaat for salaat is very necessary for you. Surely a <br>wolf devours a lonely sheep, and Satan is the wolf for <br>men.\" <br>This shows that people busy in farming etc. should ar- <br>range to say their salaat with jamaat if they are three or <br>more in number. Even if they are two, it is better to have <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>jamaat. The farmers in our country are generally negligent <br>of salaat and consider their occupation a sufficient excuse <br>for their neglect, and even those who are considered pious <br>prefer to perform their salaat individually. If the farmers <br>working in the nearby fields get together at a place and per- <br>form prayers in jamaat, they can have quite a big gathering <br>and thereby receive the wonderful blessings of Allah. Not- <br>withstanding the sun, rain, heat and cold, they keep busy <br>for a trifling worldly gain, but lose tremendous amount of <br>Allah's reward by losing salaat. On the other hand, they <br>can earn a reward fifty times more (as conveyed in another <br>hadith) by offering their salaat with jamaat in the fields. <br>It is stated in a hadith, \"When a shepherd calls out the <br>Azaan at the foot of a hill (or in the fields) and starts his <br>salaat, Allah is greatly pleased with him and says proudly <br>to the Angels, 'Behold My slave! He has called out the <br>Azaan and is offering his salaat. All this he does out of fear <br>for Me. I therefore grant him forgiveness and declare his <br>admittance into Paradise.\" <br>Somebody asked Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>\"What about a person who keeps fast all day and offers <br>nafl salaat all night, but does not go to the musjid for <br>jamaat and Jumu'ah?\" \"He is doomed to Hell\", replied <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>Such a person, being a Muslim, may ultimately get <br>freedom from Hell, but who knows after how long. The ig- <br>norant among the Soofis and Shaikhs are very particular <br>about Zikr and nafl salaat and consider this an act of emi- <br>nence in piety, while they are not particular about salaat <br>with jamaat. It must be clearly borne in mind for all times <br>that no person can achieve religious eminence except <br>through complete adherence to the practices of the beloved <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>It is stated in a hadith that Allah curses three persons: <br>An Imaam who insists on leading the people of a place in <br>salaat, although they do not like him on some reasonable <br>account, a woman who is under the displeasure of her hus- <br>Part II (b)-Reproach on Discard of Jarnaat <br>band; and a person who hears the Azaan but does not go to <br>the musjid for salaat with Jamaat. <br>Ka'b Ahbaar says, \"By Him who revealed the Torah to <br>Moosa, the Injeel to Eesa, the Psalms to Dawood (Alay- <br>himus salaam), and the Qur'an on Muhammad (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), the following verses were <br>revealed in respect of saying fardh salaat in those <br>places (mosques) where the Azaan is said: \"On the day <br>when the glory of Saaq is revealed and they are or- <br>dered to prostrate themselves, but are not able, with <br>eyes downcast, abasement stupifying them. And they <br>had been summoned to prostrate themselves when <br>they were quite hale and healthy.\" <br>(LXVIII:42 and 43). <br>The glory of Saaq is a particular type of glory to be dis- <br>played on the Day of Judgement. All Muslims will fall <br>prostrate on seeing this glory, but there will be some whose <br>backs will turn stiff and they will be unable to prostrate <br>themselves. As to who these unlucky persons would be, <br>different interpretations have been given by different com- <br>mentators. According to this hadith, which is also corrobo- <br>rated by another narrated by Hadhrat Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho), those shall be the persons who were <br>called for salaat with jamaat, but did not go for it. <br>A few other interpretations of the same are given <br>below:-<br>1. \t Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) nar- <br>rates on the authority of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) that these shall be the persons who used to <br>offer their salaat to be seen by other men. <br>Virtues of Sajaat <br>2. \t<br>These shall be infidels who did not say salaat at all. <br>3. \t These shall be the munaafiqeen. (Allah knows best and <br>His knowledge is most perfect). <br>What a terrible thing to be so abased and disgraced on <br>the Day of Judgement that, while all Muslims shall fall <br>prostrate at seeing Allah's glory, those who neglected salaat <br>with jamaat shall be singled out by their inability to do so. <br>Besides these, many other warnings have been given <br>against the neglect of jamaat. But as a matter of fact, none is <br>necessary for a good Muslim to whom the word of Allah <br>and His Apostle (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is all import- <br>ant. And for one who has no regard for their word, all such <br>warnings are meaningless. But a time will come when <br>every soul shall be called to account, and punished for its <br>misdeeds, and then no amount of penitence shall be of any <br>avail. <br><br>PART111 <br>IMPORTANCE OF SINCERITY AND DEVOTION IN <br>SALAAT <br>There are many persons who offer their salaat and <br>quite a lot of them are particular about jamaat as well, but <br>they say it so imperfectly that, instead of earning blessings <br>and reward for them, it is rejected forthwith. This, how- <br>ever, is not so bad as to discard salaat altogether, which as <br>we have already learnt, is very serious. Although we are <br>deprived of the rewards by saying a defective salaat, which <br>is not accepted, yet we are saved from the insolence of neg- <br>lecting and disobeying Allah's commandments. However, <br>when we spend our time, leave our work and undergo in- <br>convenience, then why should we not see that we get the <br>best return for our time and labour by saying our salaat as <br>best as we can? <br>This third part is divided into three chapters. In the <br>first chapter, a few quotations from the Holy Qur'an about <br>the people who are condemned for their bad salaat and <br>those who are praised for their good salaat, are given. In the <br>second Chapter, stories about the salaat of a few lovers of <br>Allah are collected. The third chapter consists of the say- <br>ings of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on this <br>subject. <br>CHAPTER I <br>QUOTATIONS FROM THE QUR'AN <br>\"Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah, but devo- <br>tion from you reacheth to Him.\" <br>(XXII:37) <br>Although this particular verse refers to the animal sac- <br>rifice, yet in principle it equally applies to all other rituals. <br>It is sincerity and devotion in a service by which its accept- <br>ance would be judged by Allah. Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>laho anho) says, \"When the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) deputed me to Yemen, I requested him to give <br>me some parting advice. He replied, 'Be sincere in all your <br>services, as sincerity will magnify the value of an action, <br>however insignificant it may be.\" <br>Hadhrat Thaubaan (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that <br>he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying, <br>\"Blessed be the sincere ones, for they are the lamps of <br>guidance. They cause the worst evils to be driven off <br>through their sincerity.\" It is said in another hadith, \"It it <br>through the presence of the weak and due to their salaat <br>and their sincerity that Allah's help comes to all the <br>people.' <br>Quotation- I1 <br>\"Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their <br>salaat, who want but to be seen at salaat.\" <br>(CVII:4-6) <br>\"To be heedless\" has been given the following differ- <br>ent interpretations: <br>1. To be so careless as to miss the correct time of salaat. <br>2. <br>To be inattentive in salaat. <br>3. To forget the number of rakaats. <br>\"When they (the hypocrites) stand up for salaat, they <br>perform it without earnestness and want but to be seen <br>by men and are mindful of Allah but little.\" <br>(IV: 142) <br>\"Now there hath succeeded them (Prophets) a later <br>generation who have ruined salaat and have followed <br>lusts. So they will meet Ghayy.\" <br>(XIX:59) <br>69 <br>i <br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>In the dictionary 'Ghayy,' is explained as deception, <br>which points towards the awful doom and ruin in the here- <br>after. According to many commentators, Ghayy is a pit in <br>Hell full of blood and pus. The persons who had ruined <br>their salaat shall be thrown into this pit. <br>Quotation- V<br>I <br>\"And naught preventeth that their (the hypocrites) <br>contributions should be accepted from them, save that <br>they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Apostle, and <br>they come not to worship, save as idlers, and pay3 not <br>i <br>(their contribution) save reluctantly.\" <br>(IV:54) <br>Note: The quotations I to V above relate to those who ruin <br>salaat. On the other hand, the following speak of <br>those whom Allah praises for their good salaat. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>\"Successful indeed are the believers who are humble <br>in their salaat. And who shun vain conversation. And <br>I \t<br>who are payers of the Zakaat. And who abstain from <br>sex, save from their wives or the slaves that their right <br>hand possess, for then they are not blameworthy but <br>who craveth beyond that, such are transgressors-And <br>who faithfully observe their pledges and their cove- <br>nants. And who pav heed to their salaat. These are the <br>heirs who will inherit Firdaus (Paradise). There they <br>will abide.\" <br>(XXIII:1to 11) <br>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, \"Fir- <br>daus is the apex and the best portion of Paradise, where- <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>from all its rivers originate. Allah's throne will be placed <br>there. When you pray for Paradise, always pray for Fir- <br>daus.\" <br>\"And truly it (salaat) is hard save for the humble- <br>minded; who know that they have to meet their Lord, <br>and that unto Him they are returning.\" <br>(11: 45-46) <br>Quotation- VIII <br>\"In houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted, <br>and His name shall be remembered therein, do offer <br>praise to Him at morning and evening, men whom <br>neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remem- <br>berance of Allah and establishment of salaat and <br>paying Zakaat, who fear that Day when the hearts and <br>the eyeballs will be overturned so that Allah may <br>reward them for the best of what they did and increase <br>reward for them out of His bounty. Allah giveth bles- <br>sings without measure to whom He will.\" (XXIV: 36 to 38) <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says <br>\"Establishment of salaat means performance of ruku and <br>sajdah properly and constant concentration in salaat with <br>complete humility and submission.\" Hadhrat Qataadah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Wherever the words 'Establish- <br>ment of salaat' occur in Qur'ar,, they mean to guard its <br>hours, to perform wudhu in the right manner and to ob- <br>serve ruku and saidah properlv.\" <br><br>Part 111 (a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>I <br>I <br>\"The (faithful) slaves of Rahmaan (the Beneficent) are <br>they who walk upon the earth modestly and when the <br>foolish ever address them, they answer: Peace; and <br>who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and <br>standing.\" <br>(XXV: 63 -64) <br>After describing a few more qualities of His faithful <br>slaves, Allah says in the same context: <br>2 <br>\"They will be awarded the high place for as much as <br>they were steadfast, and they will meet therein with <br>welcome and the word of peace. Abiding there for <br>ever. Happy is it as abode and station.\" <br>(XXV: 75-76) <br>\"The believers in our revelations are those who forsake <br>their beds, to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and <br>spend of what We have bestowed on them. No soul <br>knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy, as a reward <br>for what they used to do.\" <br>(XXXII:16-17) <br>\"I,o! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens <br>and water-springs, taking to that which their Lord <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>giveth them; for Lo! aforetime they were doers of good. <br>Thev used to s l e e ~  <br>but. little in the night. And ere the <br>dcining of ezch diy, would seek forgiveness.\" <br>(LI:15-18) <br>Quotation- XI1 <br>\"Is he who worships devotedly in the hours of the <br>night, prostrate or standing, afraid of the Hereafter and <br>hoping for the mercy of his Lord (to be counted equal <br>with a disbeliever)? Say (unto them, 0 Muhammad) <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Can those who know be <br>equal with those who know not? But only men of <br>understanding will pay heed.\" <br>(XXXIX:9) <br>And angels would be entering through every door pro- <br>claiming: \"Peace be upon you, as a reward for your <br>perseverance on religious practices.\" Thus how splen- <br>did would be their end! <br>(XIII: 22-23). <br>\"Lo! man was created very impatient. Fretful when <br>evil befalleth him. And niggardly when good befalleth <br>him, save the worshippers who are constant at their <br>salaat.\" <br>(LXX: 19-23) <br>After giving some more qualities of these blessed <br>people, Allah says in the same context, <br>II <br>~ <br>I <br>I<br>I<br>Part 111 [a)-Quotations from the Qur'an <br>\"And those who guard their salaat. These will dwell in <br>gardens, honoured.\" <br>(LXX:34-35). <br>Besides the quotations given above, there are many <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an enjoining salaat and exalting and <br>extolling those who say their salaat properly. Salaat is <br>indeed a great boon. That is why Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) has called it 'the comfort of my eyes', and <br>Ibrahim (Alayhis salaam) prayed to Allah, <br>\"My Lord! make me to establish Salaat, and some of <br>my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept the prayer.\" <br>(XIV:40) <br>Here the eminent Prophet of Allah, whom Allah has <br>called 'Khaleel', is asking Allah to make him say his salaat <br>properly and regularly. The Glorious Allah Himself is or- <br>dering His beloved Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>thus:-<br>\"And enjoin salaat upon the people and be constant <br>therein. We ask not of thee a provision. We provide for <br>thee. And the Hereafter is for righteousness.\" <br>(XX:132). <br>It is said in a hadith that whenever the housefolk of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) were hard-pressed in <br>any way, he enjoined salaat on them and used to recite this <br>verse. All the Prophets of Allah (peace be upon them) are <br>reported to have engaged themselves in salaat whenever <br>they had any difficulty. But, alas! we are so unmindful and <br>indifferent about salaat that, in spite of all that we proclaim <br>about Islaam and Islamic practices, we pay no attention to <br>it. But on the contrary, if anybody stands up to invite us <br>and to draw our attention towards it, we cut jokes and <br>sneer at him and oppose him, thereby harming none else <br>but ourselves. <br>Even those who offer the salaat, often perform it in <br>such a way that it will not be wrong to call it a mockery of <br>salaat, as it lacks the proper observation of its requisites <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>and also the devotion and submission obligatory therein. <br>The practical example of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), as also the practices of his illustrious <br>companions, should be the guiding factor in our lives. I <br>have collected the stories about the salaat of the compan- <br>ions in a separate book, named \"Stories of Sahabah,\" and I <br>need not repeat them here. However, I am giving stories <br>from the lives of a few pious persons in the following <br>pages. The practices and the sayings of the Holy Prophet <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) about this subject would <br>appear in Chapter 111. <br><br>i <br>I <br>CHAPTER I1 <br>A FEW STORIES FROM THE LIVES OF THE PIOUS <br>Shaikh Abdul Waahid (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"One <br>LI <br>day I was so much overpowered by sleep that I went to bed <br>g <br>before finishing my Zikr for the night. I saw in my dream a 3* <br>most beautiful girl dressed in green silk. All parts of her <br>body and even her shoes were engaged in Zikr. She said to <br>me 'Aspire to possess me; I love you.\" And then she recited <br>a few couplets depicting the eagerness of a lover. When I <br>woke up from the dream, I vowed not to sleep any more <br>during the night. It is reported that for full forty years he <br>never slept at night, and said Ishaa and Fajr salaats with <br>the same wudhu. <br>Story- I1 <br>Shaikh Mazhar Sa'di (Rahmatullah alaih), the famous <br>pious man, kept weeping for sixty years in love and eager- <br>ness for Allah. One night he saw in a dream a few damsels <br>by the side of pearl trees with gold branches, on the bank of <br>the brook brimming with fluid musk, pure and fragrant. <br>The girls were hymning the glory of Allah. He asked their <br>identity. In reply they recited two couplets, which meant, <br>\"We have been created by the Sustainer of mankind and <br>Lord of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for those <br>people who keep standing before Allah all night long and <br>hymning in supplication to Him.\" <br>Story -111 <br>Abu Bakr Dharir (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"There <br>lived a young slave with me. He fasted all day and stood in <br>Tahajjud all night long. One day he came to me and re- <br>lated: \"Last night against my usual practice I went to sleep. <br>1 saw in my dream that the wail of the Mihraab was <br>cracked, and from the crevice ap:3eared a few damsels. One <br>of them was very ugly. I asked one of the pretty damsels <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>who they were. She replied that they were my previous <br>nights and that the ugly one was this night.\" <br>An eminent Shaikh says: \"One night I was in a deep <br>sleep and could not get up for Tahajjud. I saw in my dream <br>a girl of such beauty as I had never seen in my life. She was <br>emitting such fragrance as I had never smelt before. She <br>handed over to me a piece of paper on which were written <br>three couplets, which meant, 'You were so enamoured of <br>deep sleep that you have become unmindful of the high <br>balconies of Paradise, where you have to abide for ever <br>with no fear of death. Wake up! It is better to recite the <br>Qur'an in Tahajjud than to sleep.\" since then, wherever I <br>feel sleepy, these couplets come to my mind and the sleep <br>goes away.\" <br>Ataa (Rahmatullah alaih) writes, \"I went to the market. <br>A person had a slave girl to sell, who was said to be mad; I <br>purchased her for seven dinaars and brought her to my <br>house. After a portion of the night had passed, I noticed <br>that she got up, performed wudhu and started her salaat. In <br>her salaat she wept so much that I thought she would die <br>of excessive crying. After finishing the salaat, she began to <br>supplicate before Allah saying, '0my Lord! By the love <br>Thou bearest for me, show mercy on me.' I interrupted by <br>telling her that she should rather say, 'By the love that I <br>have for Thee . . .\" She got irritated at this suggestion and <br>said, 'By Allah Himself! Had He not loved me, I would not <br>be standing here before Him while you are in your bed.' <br>Then she fell prostrate and recited a few couplets purport- <br>ing, 'I am growing more and more restless. How can one <br>rest whose peace of mind is taken away by love, eagerness <br>and constant anxiety? 0,Allah! Show mercy and give some <br>glad tidings.' Then she prayed in a lou l voice thus, '0 <br>Allah! So far the matter between me and Thee has been a <br>secret. Now people have come to know of it. 0,Allah! Call <br>me back.' After saying this, she cried c l ~ u d  <br>and died on the <br>spot.\" <br>story-VI <br>A similar thing happened with Sirri (Rahmatuliah <br>alaih). He writes: \"I bought a slave woman to attend on me.</p></div>"

She replied, \"If it is destined to be an <br>eye of Paradise, Allah will grant me better than this; but if <br>it be that of Hell, then the sooner it is lost the better.\" <br>Shaikh Abu Abdullah Jilaa says: \"One day my mother <br>asked my father to fetch some fish from the market. My <br>father left for the market and I also accompanied him. The <br>fish was bought and we needed a porter to carry it for us. <br>We engaged a boy who was standing there and who had of- <br>fered to do the job for us.

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>78 <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>poor boy could place his trust in Allah so much, we must <br>as well do so in a greater degree. He, therefore, left the fish <br>there and took me to the musjid. When we three returned <br>after saying salaat, we found the fish lying in the same <br>place as we had left it. The boy then carried it to our house. <br>My father related the strange story to my mother who in- <br>sisted that the boy should be invited to eat some fish with <br>us, When the invitation was extended to him, he said, <br>'Excuse me I am fasting.' My father then requested him to <br>have iftaar at our place. To this he said, 'It is not possible <br>for me to return once I am gone. Just possibly, I may stay in <br>a musjid close to your place; if so, then I shall join you in <br>your dinner.' Saying this he went to the musjid and re- <br>turned after Maghrib. When the dinner was over, I showed <br>him the room where he could rest in privacy. Now, there <br>lived a crippled woman in our neighbourhood. We were <br>surprised to see her walking quite hale and hearty. When <br>we enquired from her how she got cured, she said, 'I <br>prayed to Allah to heal me for the sake of the blessings that <br>your guest carries. No sooner I prayed than I was healed.' <br>When we went to find the boy in the room where we had <br>left him, the door was shut and the boy was nowhere to be <br>seen.\" <br>story-1X <br>It is said of a pious man that once he had a sore on his <br>foot. According to the opinion of the surgeons, if his foot <br>was not amputated, the sore might prove fatal. His mother <br>proposed that the operation should be done while he was <br>absorbed in his salaat. This was done, and no pain was felt <br>by him. <br>Abu 'Aamir (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"I saw a slave <br>woman on sale for a very small sum. She was very ema- <br>ciated and her hair was dirty. I took pity on her and pur- <br>chased her. I said to her, 'Come, woman, let us go and <br>make purchases for Ramadhaan.' She remarked, 'Alhamdu- <br>lillah, all the months are alike for me.' She fasted on all <br>days and stood in salaat for all nights. When Eid drew near, <br>I said to her, 'Woman! You will go with me tomorrow to <br>make purchases for Eid. She remarked, 'My master! You <br>are too much absorbed in this world.' She then went into <br>Part I11 (b)-Stories of the Pious <br>her room and started her salaat. She was reciting Soorah <br>Ibrahim and when she reached the 16th verse of the Soorah <br>(viz., <br>'Hell is before him and he is made to drink boiling fetid <br>water', which described the doom of a disbeliever, she re- <br>peated it again and again, and then gave out a cry and fell <br>dead.\" <br>h <br>0 ,  <br>Everybody knows Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahrnatullah <br>alaih). After the four Khulafaa-ur Raashideen he is the most <br>eminent Khalifah. His wife says, \"There may be other <br>people more particular about wudhu and salaat; but I have <br>never seen anybody fearing Allah more than my husband. <br>After his daily Ishaa, he would sit at a place reserved for <br>his salaat and raise his hands in supplication and keep <br>crying before Allah till sleep overpowered him. Whenever <br>he woke during the night, he would again start praying and <br>crying before Allah.\" <br>It is said that since his becoming Khalifah he never <br>shared the bed with his wife. His wife was the daughter of <br>the great King Abdul Malik. Her father had given her much <br>jewellery in dowry, which included a marvellous diamond. <br>He said to his wife, \"Either part with all your jewellery for <br>the sake of Allah, so that I may deposit it in the Baitul <br>Maal or be separated from me. I would not like to live in a <br>house where there is so much wealth.\" His wife replied, \"I <br>can .part with a thousand times more wealth, but I cannot <br>leave you.\" She then deposited everything she had in the <br>Baitul Maal. After the death of Umar bin Abdul Aziz, when <br>Yazeed son of Abdul Malik succeeded him as Khalifa, he <br>said to his sister, \"If you like you may have your jewellery <br>back from the Baitul Maal. She replied, \"How can the <br>wealth I discarded during my husband's lifetime, satisfy <br>me after his death.\" <br>Umar bin Abdul Aziz was on his death-bed when he <br>inquired from the persons round him about the cause of his <br>disease. Someone said, \"People think it is the effect of <br>black magic.\" He said, \"No, it is not magic.\" He then sent <br>for a particular slave of his and said to him, \"What made <br>you poison me?\" He replied, \"One hundred dinaara and a <br>Virtues of Salaat <br>promise of liberty.\" Umar bin Abdul Aziz (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) took those dinaars from the slave and deposited <br>them in the Baitul Maal, and advised him to run away to <br>some distant place where he could not be seized. <br>Just before his death, Muslimah (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>came to him and said, \"Nobody has ever treated his chil- <br>dren as you are doing. None of your thirteen sons has any- <br>thing to live on.\" He sat up in his bed and said, 'I have not <br>held back from my sons what they were entitled to. I have, <br>of course, refused them what was actually due to others. If <br>my sons are righteous, then Allah will surely be their <br>guardian as He has said in His Book: He is the guardian of <br>the righteous (VII:196)', but if they are wrong-doers, then <br>why should I care for them?\" <br>Story-XI1 <br>Muhammad bin Mu.nkadir (Rahmatullah alaih) was a <br>Hafiz of Hadith. One night, he wept excessively in his Ta- <br>hajjud. When someone inquired about it, he said, \"During <br>Qiraat, I came across the following words of the Qur'an: <br>\"And the evils that they earned will confront them; <br>and they will be surrounded by what they used to scoff <br>at.\" <br>(XXXIX: 48) <br>He was very anxious and worried at the time of his <br>death, and said that these same words of the Qur'an were <br>looming before him. <br>Story-XI11 <br>Thaabit Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) is another Hafiz <br>of Hadith. He used to cry a great deal while supplicating <br>before Allah. Someone warned him that he would lose his <br>eyesight if he did not stop weeping like that. He replied to <br>him, \"What use sre these eyes if these do not weep before <br>Allah.\" <br>He used to ask in his prayer, \"0,Allah! Permit ms to <br>offer my salaat in my grave, if ever you grant this privilege <br>to any of Thy slaves!\" Abu Sanaan (Rahmatullah alaih) nar- <br>rates, \"By Allah! I was among those present at the burial of <br>Thaabit Banaani. Just after he had been placed in his grave, <br>one of the bricks from the side fell off. I peeped into the pit <br>to find to my great amazement, that Thaabit was offering <br>Part I11 (b)-Stories of the Pious <br>his salaat. I said to a person standing by my side, 'Look <br>what is that.' He advised me to keep quiet. After the burial, <br>we went to his daughter and inquired from her, 'What was <br>the special practice sf your father?' She wanted to know <br>what made us put that question. We related to her the inci- <br>dent at the grave. She said, \"He has been constant in Tahaj- <br>jud for fifty years and prayed every morning before Allah to <br>allow him to offer salaat in the grave if that privilege could <br>be granted to anybody.\" <br>Before finishing this chapter, I give below the pursuits <br>(as regards salaat) of some of our eminent Muslim ances- <br>tors: <br>1. \t Imaam Ahmad bin Hambal (Rahmatullah alaih) is <br>the famous Imaam of one, of the four schools of <br>Muslim jurisprudence. Besides being engaged in <br>his usual work, he used to offer daily three hun- <br>dred rakaats of nafl salaat. After he was lashed by <br>the king for refusal to submit to the royal edict, he <br>became very weak and reduced his routine nafl <br>salaat to one hundred and fifty rakaats. We should <br>not forget that he was eighty at that time. <br>2. \t<br>Imaam Shaafi'ee (Rahmatullah alaih) another emi- <br>nent Imaam of Muslim jurisprudence, used to <br>finish reciting the Qur'an sixty times in his salaat <br>during Ramadhaan. A person narrates, \"I re-<br>mained with Imaam Shaafi'ee for several days and <br>found him sleeping only for a while at night.\" <br>3. \t<br>Imaam Abu Haneefa (Rahmatullah alaih) is famous <br>for his vigil. It is said that for thirty, forty or fifty <br>years (according to the information of different <br>narrators) he offered his Fajr prayer with the <br>wudhu for Ishaa. He would go to sleep only for a <br>few minutes in the afternoon saying, \"It is sunnat <br>to sleep in the afternoon.\" <br>4. \t It is said about Sa'eed bin Musayyab (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) that for fifty years he offered his Fajr salaat <br>with the wudhu performed at Ishaa. <br>Imaam Ghazzali (Rahmatullah alaih) on the auth- <br>ority of Abu Taalib Makki reported the same prac- <br>tice by no less than forty Taabi'ees, some of whom <br>had been doing it for forty years continuously. <br>5. \t Muhammad bin Nasr (Rahmatullah alaih) is a <br>famous Muhaddith. His devotion to salaat had no <br><br>Virtues of Salaat <br>parallel. Once while in salaat, he was stung on his <br>forehead by a wasp and though blood came out, <br>neither did he stir nor did he allow it to disturb <br>his devotion in salaat. It is said that in salaat, he <br>stood motionless like a stick planted in the <br>ground. <br>6. \t It is reported about Baqi bin Mukhallid (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) that he used to recite the complete <br>Qur'an every night in thirteen rakaats of Tahajjud <br>and Witr. <br>7. \t Hannaad (Rahmatullah alaih) is a Muhaddith. One <br>of his pupils narrates, \"Hannaad used to weep <br>very much. One day after he had finished our <br>lesson in the morning, he continued to offer nafl <br>salaat till midday. He went to his place for a short <br>interval and then returned for his Zuhr. He again <br>engaged himself in nafl salaat till Asr. Between <br>Asr and Maghrib, he recited the Qur'an. I left him <br>after Maghrib. I said to one of his neighbours, 'Our <br>Shaikh prays so much. It is really wonderful.' He <br>said, \"He had been doing this for the last seventy <br>years. You will wonder still more if you see his <br>prayers during the night.\" <br>8. \t Masrooq (Rahmatullah alaih) is another Muhad- <br>dith. His wife narrates, \"He used to offer such long <br>rakaats that his legs would get swollen and I sat <br>behind weeping in pity for him.\" <br>9. \t Abu Itaab Sulami (Rahmatullah alaih) is reported <br>to have been fasting during the day and weeping <br>during the night for full forty years. <br>10. It is said about .a Sayyid that continuously for <br>twelve days he has been offering his salaat with <br>the same wudhu. For fifteen years, his back had <br>not touched the bed. He would also gc without <br>food for days together. <br>Eesides the above, there are numerous records of the <br>pious pursuits of the heroes of Islamic History. It is diffi- <br>cult to cover all of them in this book. All that has been said <br>here is sufficient to serve as examples. May Allah, thrpugh <br>His Grace, grant me and the readers of this book the <br>sirength to follow in the footsteps of these blessed people! <br>Aameen!</p></div>"

This move- <br>= <br>8 5 <br>KI <br>12 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ment is well known and needs no introduction. Its good re- <br>sults soon began to be visible in India and abroad <br>generally, but especially so in the region of Mewat, as is <br>well-known. The fundamental principles of this movement <br>are basically very sound, good and strong, and are inhe- <br>rently fruitful and bedicial. One 'of the important prin- <br>ciples is that those who are engaged in Tableegh work <br>should be particular in practising zikr, and more so when <br>they are actually busy in Tabligh work. After observing the <br>wonderful results of this practice, I myself felt the neces- <br>sity of writing this booklet. I was also ordered by my re- <br>spected uncle that the virtues of zikr of Allah should be <br>compiled and made available to them, so that those who so <br>far practise it out of obedience to Allah may themselves <br>feel an urge for doing so for the sake of its virtues, and <br>thereby realise that zikr is a great wealth. <br>It is neither possible for a humble person like myself to <br>compile a comprehensive treatise on the virtues of zikr, nor <br>is it humanly possible to do full justice to this subject. I <br>have however briefly described some narrations relating to <br>this subject. I have divided the book into three chapters, of <br>which the virtues of zikr in general are described in the <br>first chapter, those of Kalimah Tayyibah in the second and <br>those of the third Kalimah (known as Tasbeeh-Fatimah) in <br>the third. <br>CHAPTER I <br>VIRTUES OF ZIKR IN GENERAL <br>Even if there were no ayat or hadith relating to zikr, we <br>should not have forgotten to remember our real Benefactor, <br>Whose blessings and favours on us at all times are unlimi- <br>ted, and have no parallel. It is but natural that we should <br>remember our Benefactor, perform His zikr (remember <br>Him) and thank Him. Countless virtues of zikr are de-<br>scribed in the Qur'an and.Ahaadith, and the sayings and <br>deeds of our elders in support thereof are available for our <br>benefit. No doubt, the blessings of the glorious zikr of Allah <br>are unlimited and its effulgence is so sublime. <br>Here, I first describe a few ayaat (Verses from the Holy <br>Qur'an) and then some ahaadith on the subject of His <br>glorious zikr. <br>SECTION 1 <br>QuranicVerses relating Zikr <br>8 s4 <br>E N  <br>1.Therefore remember Me, I will remember you.

And when ye have completed your Hajj rites, then <br>remember Allah as ye remember your fathers, or with a <br>more lively remembrance. There are men who say, \"Our <br>Creator!

Allah is swift at reckon- <br>ing. <br>It is related in a hadith that the du'aa of three persons <br>is not rejected rather it is surely accepted. (1)He who re- <br>members Allah profusely (2) A wronged person (3) A ruler <br>who avoids tyranny. <br>4.

Allah hath <br>promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, <br>forgiveness and immense reward. <br>COMMENTARY <br>In these verses though the emphasis obviously is on <br>the blessings occurrirlg from ruku, sujood and salaat but <br>there is also an indication about the blessings associated <br>with the second part of the Kalimah viz. (Muhammadur <br>Rasulullah). <br>Imam Raazi (Rahmatullah alaih) has related that in the <br>treaty of Hudaibiyah, on the refusal and insistence of the <br>unbeliever not to write 'Muhammad Rasulullah' and to <br>substitute it by 'Muhammad bin Abdullah', Allah Ta'aalaa <br>asserts that He himself bears testimony to the Prophethood <br>of Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). When the <br>Sender confirms personally about a particular person to be <br>His messenger, then the non-acceptance by any number of <br>people does not matter. To confirm this testimony, Allah <br>Ta'aalaa made the statement 'Muhammadur Rasulullah' <br>(Muhammad is a Prophet of Allah). <br>There are other important subjects in these verses. One <br>of them relates to the glow on the face of a blessed person. <br>It has been explained that a person who keeps a vigil at <br>night for prayers develops such a glow on his face. Imaam <br>Raazi (Rahmatullah alaih) considers it an established fact <br>that if two persorls keep awake at night, one spending it in <br>sensual and idle pleasures and the other uses his time in <br>reciting the Qur'an, learning religious knowledge and offer- <br>ing pravers, thev will get up with different facial express- <br>ions the next morning. The latter described above will be <br>because of his spiritual glow, will show himself quite a dif-<br>ferent person. <br><br>The third important thing is that Imaam Maalik (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) and a group of scholars established kufr for <br>those people who talk ill of the Sahaba and bear hatred <br>against them. <br>45.

And when the (Friday) prayer is ended, then dis- <br>perse in the land and seek of Allah's bounty, (with the per- <br>mission to engage yourself in worldly pursuits but even <br>then) and remember Allah much, that ye may be success- <br>ful. <br>48. 0 ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your <br>children distract you from remembrance of Allah. Those <br>who do so, they are the losers.

Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) advises <br>benediction on a person, affected by malignant looks, after <br>reciting this verse. <br>50.

He is successful who purifieth himself (of evil <br>manners) and remembereth the name of his Lord, so <br>prayeth. <br><br>Chapter 1 <br>SECTION 2 <br>AHAADITH ON ZIKR <br>(REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH) <br>When the importance of zikr has been emphasised in <br>so many verses of the Holy Qur'an, the number of ahaadith <br>on this subject is naturally far too great; it is in proportion <br>to the many voluminous books of ahaadith. The Holy <br>Qur'an is one book of only 30 parts, but the books of ahaa- <br>dith are many and each book contains a large number of <br>ahaadith. For example, Bukhari Shareef alone consists of <br>30 voluminous parts, and similarly Abu Dawood Shareef <br>has 32 parts. There is no book of ahaadith which does not <br>contain several ahaadith on the subject of zikr, and it is, <br>therefore impossible to quote all such ahaadith in this <br>small booklet. Of course, a single verse of the Holy Qur'an <br>or a hadith moves the faithful-to good actions, but volumes <br>of books would not move an unwilling person, who is like <br>an ass carrying a load of books. <br>Hadith No 2 7 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Almighty Allah says, 'I treat my slave (man) accord- <br>ing to his expectations from Me, and I am with him <br>when he remembers Me, If he remembers Me in his <br>heart, I remember him in My heart; if he remembers <br>Me in a gathering, I remember him in a better and <br>nobler gathering (i.e. of angels). If he comes closer to <br>Me by one span, I go towards him a cubit's length, if he <br>comes towards Me by a cubit's length, I go towards <br>him an arm's length, and if he walks towards Me, I run <br>unto him.\" <br>Note: There are several points elaborated in this <br>hadith. The first point is that Allah deals with a man <br>according to his expectations from Him. One should there- .s <br>fore always be hopeful of the mercy and benevolence of <br>9;<br>Almighty Allah and never be despondent of His blessings. <br>y N <br>Certainly, we are extremely sinful and justly deserve pun- <br>ishment on account of our evil deeds, yet in no case should <br>we feel despondent of the mercy of Allah, as He may per- <br>haps totally forgive us. <br>\"Lo! Allah forgiveth not if a artner be ascribed unto <br>Him and forgiveth all save that to w \\om He will.\" <br>But Almighty Allah may or map ,not forgive; that is <br>why the Ulama say that true belief lies in between hope (of <br>forgiveness of Allah) and fear (of His wrath). The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once visited a young <br>Sahabi, who was breathing his last, and asked him how he <br>was feeling. He replied, \"O!Messenger of Allah, I am hope- <br>ful of the mercy of Allah, and yet I am afraid of my sins.\" <br>Thereupon the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said \"When the heart of a believer is filled with these two <br>feelings of hope and fear, Almighty Allah fulfils his hope <br>and saves him from what he is afraid of.\" <br>It is mentioned in one hadith that a believer thinks of <br>his sin, as if he is sitting under a huge rock that is threaten- <br>ing to fall on him, while for a transgressor his sin is no <br>more than a fly which is easily scared off, i.e., he takes his <br>sins very lightly. In short, one should be appropriately <br>afraid of ones sins, and at the same time remain hopeful of <br>Allah's mercy. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyallaho anho) died of the <br>plague and, in the moments of death's agony, he fainted <br>many times. Whenever he regained consciousness for a <br>moment, he would say, \"Oh Allah! Thou knowest that I <br>love Thee. By Thy Honour and Glory, Thou knowest this <br>very well.\" Just before breathing his last, he said, \"0Death, <br>you are a welcome guest but have come at a time when <br>there is nothing in the .house to eat.\" Then he said, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou knowest very well that I always feared Thee, <br>and today I die hopeful of Thy forgiveness. 0 Allah! I en- <br>joyed life, not in digging canals and planting gardens, but <br>in remaining thirsty in the hot weather, in undergoing <br>hardships for the sake of Islaam, and in taking part in the <br>gatherings engaged in zikr under the supervision of the <br>lama.\" <br>Some Ulama have written that the fulfilment of expec- <br>tations promised by Almighty Allah in the aforesaid hadith <br>is in its most general sense. It carries assurance not only in <br>respect of forgiveness but also in respect of prayers, health, <br>wealth and safety. For instance when a person prays to <br>Allah and sincerely believes that Allah shall accept his <br>prayer, then his prayer is actually accepted, but if he has <br>doubt (that his prayer would not be accepted), it is not ac- <br>cepted. Thus, in another hadith it is stated that the prayer <br>of a person is granted so long as he does not say that his <br>prayer is not granted. The same is true in the case of all <br>blessings relating to health, prosperity, etc. According to <br>one hadith, if a destitute perssn discloses his hunger to <br>everybody, he is not relieved of his poverty, but if ,he <br>shows submission to Gracious Allah, his condition may <br>soon change for the better. However, hoping for the better <br>from Almighty Allah is one thing, and being over-confident <br>of His help and forgiveness is another thing. Almighty <br>Allah has warned us against such an attitude in several <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an e.g. <br>ij$\\ .A4.$3 yj <br>\"Let not the deceiver (the Satan) beguile you in regard <br>to Allah\" i.e. one should not be misled by the devil to <br>commit sins just because Allah is the most Merciful <br>and the Forgiver\". <br>There is another verse, <br>* , * + J , * I ; J + ~ \\ $  <br><br>Ch. 1: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>\"Hath he knowledge of the Unseen, or hath he made a <br>pact with the Beneficent. No, never.\" <br>The second point in this hadith is \"Whenever a slave <br>of mine remembers Me, I am with him.\" In another hadith, <br>it is stated, \"So long as one's lips move in My remem- <br>brance I remain with him\" i.e. Almighty Allah bestows His <br>special care and mercy on him during all this time. <br>The third point is that Almighty Allah mentions him <br>with a favour to the angels, which signifies the value of <br>zikr. Firstly, this is because Allah created man such that in- <br>herently he is liable to be good as well as to go astray, as <br>given below in Hadith No. 8. Submission on his part there- <br>fore deserves special appreciation. Secondly, at the time of <br>Aadam's creation, the Angels (who have no instinct for <br>doing evil) could not understand the creation of man and <br>had contended that he would cause blood-shed and trouble <br>+<br>O <br>in the world, while they are always there to praise and <br>glorify Almighty Allah. Thirdly, man's worship of Allah 13 <br>and submission to His will is more commendable than that <br>of the Angels, because he does so on account of his faith in <br>the unseen which, however, is actually seen by the angels. <br>It is to this fact that Allah refers in the Holy Book: \"How <br>would man not have worshipped if he had actually seen <br>the Paradise and the Hell.\" It is for this reason that <br>Almighty Allah praises the noble deeds of those who <br>worship and glorify Him without seeing Him. <br>The fourth point contained in the above-mentioned <br>hadith is that if a man increases his devotion to Almighty <br>Allah, the increase in His mercy and kindness upon him is <br>proportionately far greater. \"Getting near\" and \"running\" <br>signify immediate increase in His blessings and mercy. <br>Thus, it is upto a person that, if he wants to enjoy more <br>kindness and favours from Almighty Allah, he should in- <br>crease his devotion to Him. <br>The fifth point in the above mentioned hadith is that <br>the Angels have been stated to be superior to man, while it <br>is commonly known that man is the best creation of Allah. <br>One reason for this,has already been explained in the trans- <br>lation (of the hadith), that the angels are superior because <br>they are innocent and are unable to commit sins. Secondly, <br>they are superior because they are better than the majority <br>of men, including even the majority of believers; arid yet <br>some selected Believers like the Prophets (Alaihimus <br>salaam) are superior to the angels. There are other reasons <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>as well, which are however left out in order to prevent the <br>discourse from getting too long. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>A Sahabi once said, \"0,Rasulullah, (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I know that the commandments of Sharee- <br>at am many, but of these tell me the one that I may <br>practise assiduously throughout my life.\" The Prophet, <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), replied, \"Keep ydUr <br>tongue always moist (i.e. busy) with the zikr of Allah.\" <br>According to another hadith, Harat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has said, \"Once at the time of my departure <br>from Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), I asked <br>him to advise me of that action which is most pleasing <br>to Almighty Allah: whereupon he replied, \"At the time <br>I <br>of your death, your tongue should be busy with zikr of <br>Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: By \"my departure\", Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) refers to the occasion when he was appointed <br>by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as the <br>Governor of Yemen and sent there for teaching and propa- <br>gating Islaam. It was at the time of that farewell that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given him some <br>parting instructions. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>By saying that \"the commandments of Sharee-at are <br>many\", the Sahabi had meant that although observance of <br>every commandment is imperative, to specialize and attain <br>perfection in each and every one is difficult; and so he <br>wanted that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), may <br>recommend him something of over-riding importance <br>which he might hold fast to, and practise at all times and in <br>all conditions of sitting, standing or walking. <br>According to another hadith, a person who pos- <br>sesses the following four things is truly blessed, from <br>the worldly as well as spiritual point of view:- <br>(i) A tongue ever absorbed in the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah. <br>(ii) A heart filled with gratitude of Allah. <br>(iii) A body capable of undergoing hardships. <br>(iv) A wife who does not betray her husband's trust in <br>respect of her chastity and his wealth. <br>The phrase \"moist tongue\" according to some Ulama <br>means excessive utterance (of zikr) and, idiomatically, it is <br>used to convey excessive glorification and praise. But in <br>my (the author's) humble opinian it can have another <br>meaning as well. It is always very sweet and pleasant to <br>talk of one's beloved, as is the common feeling and experi- <br>ence of every lover. On this basis, the phrase \"moist <br>tongue\" would, therefore mean that one should glorify <br>with love the name of Almighty Allah, so as to feel love's <br>sweetness in the mouth. I have observed many times that <br>when some of my religious elders do zikr aloud, the flavour <br>of the sweetness enjoyed by them is so transmitted to the <br>listeners that their mouths also feel the sweetness and they <br>share the ecstasy likewise. But this phenomenon is poss- <br>ible only where there is a genuine yearning for zikr, and <br>the tongue is accustomed to excessive zikr. It is stated in <br>one hadith that the proof of one's love for Almighty Allah <br>lies in one's love for the zikr of Allah, and in the same way <br>lack of zikr betrays lack of attachment with Almighty <br>Allah. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) said that <br>those who keep their tongues wet with the zikr of Allah, <br>will snter paradise smiling. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>HadithNo. 3 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said to <br>his companions, \"Shall I tell you of something that is <br>the best of all deeds, constitutes the best act of piety in <br>the eyes of your Lord, will elevate your status in the <br>Hereafter, and carries more virtue than the spending of <br>gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in <br>jihaad arid slayin or being slain in the path of Allah.\" <br>The Com anions egged to be informed of such an act. <br>The Prop Ret (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is <br>the zikr of Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: This hadith is a generalized statement; other- <br>wise, at times of specific need and emergency sadaqah <br>(charity) and jihaad (fighting in the path of Allah), etc., <br>become more desirable, as stated in some other ahaadith. <br>These acts become more important during the hour of <br>need, but the zikr is for all times and therefore generally <br>more important and virtuous. <br>According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said, \"for everything <br>there is a purifier or cleanser. (For instance, soap is used <br>for cleaning the body and the clothes, while a furnace is <br>used for purifying iron). The zikr of Almighty Allah <br>cleanses and purifies the heart, and provides the best pro- <br>tection against retribution in the Hereafter.\" This hadith <br>describes zikr as the purifier of the heart, and as such it <br>also established superiority of zikr over all other actions, <br><br>because the value of every act of worship depends upon <br>ikhlaas (sincerity of the intention), which in turn depends <br>on the purity of heart. Therefore, according to some Sufis, <br>the zikr in this hadith implies the zikr of the heart as <br>against the zikr by the tongue. By the zikr of the heart, they <br>mean that the heart remains always conscious of, and in <br>communication with Almighty Allah. This state of the <br>heart is doubtless superior to all kinds of worship, because <br>when this state is attained, then omission of any kind of <br>worship is just not possible. All parts of the human body, <br>internal and external, are controlled by the heart and <br>submit completely to the Being to Whom the heart is at- <br>tached. The conduct of true lovers bears ample testimony <br>to this fact. <br>There are many more ahaadith that describe the <br>superiority of zikr over all other actions. Somebody en- <br>quired of Hazrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) as to what <br>action of man is most virtuous. He replied, \"Have you not <br>read in the Holy Qur'an, <br>(certainly the zikr of Allah is most exalted)?\" <br>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) had referred <br>here to the first ayat of Part 21 of the Holy Qur'an. The <br>author of \"Majaalisul Abraar\", while commenting on this <br>Hadith, has written that zikr of Allah is described to be su- <br>perior to sadaqah, jihaad, and all forms of worship, because <br>it is an end in itself, and ail types of worship constitute <br>only a means to achieve this end. zikr is of two kinds: one <br>is done by word of mouth and the other is in the form of <br>deep meditation and contemplation. It is the latter form of <br>zikr that is implied in the hadith which states that medita- <br>tion for one moment is better than doing worship for se- <br>venty years. Hadhrat Suhail (Radhiyallaho anho) reported <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The <br>reward of the zikr of Allah is seven hundred thousand <br>times more than that for spending wealth in the path of <br>Allah.\" <br>Thus, in conclusion, it is evident that jihaad and sada- <br>qah, etc., assume more importance and become more virtu- <br>ous due to the need of the hour. The ahaadith which <br>describe their superiority are therefore understandable. For <br>instance, it is stated in one hadith that standing up for a <br>short while in the path of Allah is more valuable than offer- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ing salaat at home for seventy years. Although salaat is <br>unanimously admitted to be the best form of worship, yet <br>taking part in jihaad at the time of an invasion by the infi- <br>dels carries far greater reward. <br>Hadith No.4 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), said, \"There <br>are many a people who do zikr of .Almighty Allah, <br>while lying comfortably in their soft beds, and for this, <br>they will be rewarded with the highest positions in <br>Paradise by Almighty Lord.\" <br>Note: ~ b n e r a l ~ ~ ,  <br>the greater the sufferings and hard- <br>ships one undergoes in the cause of religion, the higher <br>will be his status in the Hereafter. But the zikr of Allah is <br>such a blessed act that, even if it is done in soft beds in this <br>world, it will bring high rewards and elevated positions in <br>the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said, \"If you keep yourselves busy in zikr all the time, the <br>angels will shake hands with you in your beds as well as <br>on your way.\" <br>, <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"The mufarrideen have gone far ahead.\" \"Who are the mu- <br>farrideen?\" enquired the Sahabah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Those who are intensely de- <br>voted to the zikr of Allah.\" On the basis of this hadith, the <br>Sufis have stated that the kings and rulers should not be <br>prevented from zikr of Allah, for they, by this means, can <br>attain a lofty rank in the Hereafter. <br>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"Glorify <br>Almighty Allah during the time of prosperity and happi- <br>ness, and it will help you in times of distress and trouble \" <br>-<br>1-ladhrat Salmaan Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"If a <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>person remembers Allah in times of peace, pleasure and <br>prosperity, then whenever he is in trouble and difficulty, <br>the angels, being familiar with his voice, recognise him in <br>his helplessness and intercede before Almighty Allah (for <br>his forgiveness); but, if one who does not remember Allah <br>in his time of pleasure and happens to pray for help at the <br>time of difficulty, the angels find his voice to be quite un- <br>familiar and therefore do not intercede for him.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas, (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"Para- <br>dise has eight gates, one of which is exclusively reserved <br>for those who are engaged in zikr.\" It is said in one hadith, <br>\"A person who constantly does zikr of Allah is immune <br>from hypocrisy in faith\", and according to another hadith, <br>\"He is loved by Almighty Allah.\" <br>Once during his return journey to Madina Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Where are those who <br>have gone ahead.\" The Companions said, \"The fast travel- <br>g & <br>lers have gone ahead\": then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe 8<br>wasallam) said, \"Those who remain ahead are the persons <br>who remain constantly absorbed in zikr. Whoever desires <br>to enjoy himself in Paradise, should do zikr of Allah ex- <br>cessively.\" <br>Hadith No 5 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"The <br>contrast between a person who glorifies Almighty <br>Allah and one who does not remember Him is like that <br>between the living and the dead.\" <br>Note: <br>Life is dear to all, and every one fears death. The <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) meant to say that one <br>who does not remember Allah, though bodily alive, is <br>spiritually dead and his life is but worthless. A Persian <br>couplet quoted here by the author means, <br>\"(The lover says) My life (of loneliness) is no life; his is the <br>life who lives in contact with the beloved.\" <br>Some scholars have stated that the example refers to the <br>condition of the heart: the heart that remembers Allah is <br>really alive, while the one that does not, is described as <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i <br>dead. Some scholars say that the contrast is in respect of <br>gain and loss. A man who harasses a zaakir is like one har- <br>assing a living being, and he will be avenged for this har- <br>assment and will suffer for it. One who ill-treats the <br>neglectful, ill-treats a dead body, which cannot avenge <br>itself. Some Sufis say that the hadith refers to the eternal <br>life of the zaakireen, because those who glorify Allah con- <br>stantly with sincerity never really die, but instead remain <br>spiritually alive even after passing away from this world. <br>The zaakireen also enjoy a special life after death, like the <br>martyrs, mentioned in a verse of the Holy Qur'an: <br>Nay, they are alive in the eyes of their Sustainer. <br>Hakiem Tirmizi writes, \"Zikr moistens the heart and <br>softens it. A heart that is devoid of zikr becomes dry and <br>hard, due to the excessive heat of lust and base desires. All <br>parts of the body likewise become stiff and abstain from <br>submission to Allah; if you try to bend them, they break <br>like a dry piece of wood, which can be used as firewood <br>only. <br>Hadith No. 6 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"If a person has a lot of wealth and distrib- <br>utes it amongst the needy, while another person is <br>only busy with the zikr of Allah, the latter, who is en- <br>gaged in zikr, is the better of the two.\" <br>Note: <br>Spending in the path of Allah is a splendid virtue, but <br>zikr of Allah is more virtuous. How lucky are those well-to- <br>do persons who, in addition to spending for the pleasure of <br>Allah, remain also devoted to His zikr. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>According to one hadith, Almighty Allah also gives sa- <br>daqah every day, i.e. He showers His favours on the eople, <br>and everybody gets what he deserves, but the luc Eiest is <br>the person who is favoured with the ability to do His zikr. <br>People who are engaged in different occupations, such as <br>trade, farming and service, should spare some time for zikr <br>every day and thereby earn great rewards. It should not be <br>difficult to devote an hour or two out of 24 hours, exclus- <br>ively for this noble purpose. <br>A lot of our time is wasted in frivolous pursuits, and <br>some of this can be easily spared for this most useful work. <br>In another hadith, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) is reported to have said, \"The wisest of all people are <br>those who keep track of time, with the help of the sun, the <br>moon, the stars, and the shadows, for doing zikr regularly.\" <br>Nowadays we can determine time with the help of <br>* <br>watches, yet one should be able to judge time with the help <br>of these natural agents, so that no time gets wasted in case <br>the watch stops or goes out of order. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the place where zikr is done, takes pride over <br>other parts of the earth. <br>Hadith No. 7 <br>The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"Those who are admitted into Paradise will not regret <br>over anything of this world, except the time spent <br>without zikr in their life.\" <br>Note: <br>After their entry into Paradise, when they will see the <br>huge reward (as large as mountains) for remembering Allah <br>once, they will feel extremely sorry over their loss caused <br>by the time spent without zikr, as can be well imagined. In <br>this world, there are such blessed persons who would not <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>relish this life it is were spent without the zikr of Allah. <br>Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahmatullah aiaih) writes in his book <br>\"Munabbihaat\" that Yahya bin Mu'aaz Raazi (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) used to say in his supplication: <br>0 Allah! the nigl.. is no good unless spent in com- <br>munion with You, the day is no good unless spent in <br>worshipping You, this life is no good without Your zikr, <br>the next life will be no good without forgiveness from You, <br>and Paradise will not be enjoyable without beholding You. <br>Hadhrat Sirri (Rahmatullah alaih) says, \"I saw Jurjani <br>swallowing roasted barley flour. He told me that he had <br>compared the time taken in chewing bread and in eating <br>barley flour: eating bread took so much longer that he <br>could say <br>h<br>i <br>seventy times in that time. There- <br>fore, he had not taken bread for forty years, and had lived <br>by swallowing barley flour alone.\" <br>It is said about Mansoor bin Mu'tamar that he never <br>spoke to anybody after Ishaa prayers for forty years. Simi- <br>larly, it is said about Rabee' bin Hatheem that it was his <br>practice for twenty years that he noted down what he <br>talked during the day, and would check at night whether <br>that talking was necessary or not. Those pious scholars <br>were particular that every moment of their life was spent in <br>zikr and in nothing else. <br>Hadith No 8 <br>I <br><br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) and Hadh- <br>rat Abu Sa'eed (Radhiyallaho anho) both bore testi- <br>mony to having heard from Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), that the gathering engaged in zikr of <br>Almighty Allah is surrounded by the angels on all <br>sides, the grace of Allah and sakeenah (peace and tran- <br>quility) descend upon them, and Almighty Allah <br>speaks about them, by way of appreciation, to His <br>angels.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) related that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said to him, \"I <br>advise you to fear Allah, as this is the root of all virtues; <br>remain engaged in the recitation of Holy Qur'an and in zikr <br>of Almighty Allah, which will earn you an appreciation in <br>the Heavens and serve you as a light in this world; keep <br>silent for most of the time, so that you speak nothing but <br>good, as this will keep the Devil away from you and make <br>%+<br>E N<br>it easy for you to perform your religious duties, abstain also <br>$<br>from too much laughing, for laughing weakens the heart <br>and deprives the face of its spiritual glow (luminosity), <br>always take part in jihaad as this is the sign of piety for my <br>ummah; like the poor and keep their company; compare <br>your lot with persons lower than you, and never look upto <br>those higher than you, otherwise you will forget the boun- <br>ties of Almightv Allah and become ungrateful to Him; try <br>to retain ties with your relatives though they may try to <br>break them; do not hesitate to speak out the truth, though it <br>may be bitter for others: always obey Almighty Allah in <br>spite of adverse criticism, find fault with your own self, <br>and never with others; do not criticise others for the short- <br>comings that you suffer from. O! Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) there is no wisdom better than farsightedness, absti- <br>nence from the unlawful is the best act of piety, and good <br>manners constitute true nobility.\" <br>Note: <br>The word 'sakeenah' according to various scholars <br>means tranquility and peace, as well as Allah's special <br>mercy, as explained in detail in my book Fazaa'il-i-Qur'an. <br>I:or instance, Imam Nawawi (Rahmatullah alaih) states that <br>sakeenah is a special favour consisting of tranquility, <br>mercy, etc. and is brought down from the Heavens by the <br>angels. <br>This appreciation, in the presence of the angels, by <br>Almighty Allah for those engaged in zikr is for two reasons. <br><br>Firstly, it is because the angels (as mentioned under the <br>first hadith) had submitted, at the time of the creation of <br>Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam), that man would commit <br>mischief in the world. Secondly, it is because the Angels <br>are ever engaged in prayers, submission, and obedience to <br>Almighty Allah, and are devoid of the very instinct for sin, <br>whereas man has the instinct of obedience as well as of sin <br>and (in addition) he is surrounded by things that lead him <br>to negligence and disobedience, and has desires and lust <br>ingrained in him. Therefore, prayers, submission and absti- <br>nence from sin, despite all his handicaps, are more praise- <br>worthy and creditable on his part. <br>In one hadith, it is stated that, when Allah created <br>Paradise, he told the angel Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to go <br>and visit it. On his return from Paradise, he reported, \"0 <br>Lord! by Your Greatness, whoever comes to know of it, will <br>do his best to enter it\", that is to say, its pleasures, com- <br>forts, enjoyments and blessings are so intense that there <br>will be no body who, after knowing and believing these, <br>will not strive his utmost for admission into it. Almighty <br>Allah then surrounded Paradise with hardships and made <br>it compulsory to offer prayers, observe fasting, take part in <br>jihaad, go for Haj, etc., for admission into it. Almighty <br>Allah then sent Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to visit it again. <br>He saw these and then said, \"0 Allah! I fear that hardly <br>anybody will be able to enter it.\" Similarly, after creating <br>Hell, Almighty Allah ordered Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to <br>visit it. After witnessing the punishments, horrors, afflic- <br>tions and tortures of Hell, he submitted, \"I swear by Thy <br>Grandeur that one who comes to know of the conditions in <br>Hell will never dare go near it.\" Then Allah surrounded <br>Hell with acts of indulgence, such as adultery, drinking <br>wine, cruelty, disregard of the Divine commandments, etc., <br>and then asked Jibra-eel (Alayhis salaam) to visit it again. <br>He saw it and submitted. \"My Lord! I fear that hardly any- <br>body will be able to escape it.\" It is for this reason that, <br>when a person obeys Almighty Allah and abstains from <br>sins, he becomes praiseworthy with respect to his environ- <br>ments, and therefore Almighty Allah expresses His pleas- <br>ure about him. The angels mentioned in this hadith and in <br>so many other similar ahaadith belong to a special group <br>who are dutv-bound to visit the places and attend the meet- <br>ings where people are engaged in zikr. This is supported by <br>another hadith wherein it is stated that there is a class of <br>angels who are scattered all over, and when and wherever <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>i <br>i<br>any one of them hears zikr being recited he calls all his <br>companions to come to that place, and partake of what they <br>wanted. They throng to the place and they fill it up to the <br>sky, as mentioned in Chapter I1 under item 14. <br>Hadith No.9 <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) went to a <br>group of Sahaba, (Radhiyallaho anhum) and said to <br>them, \"What for are you sitting here?\" They replied, <br>\"We are engaged in the zikr of Almighty Allah, and are <br>glorifying Him for His extreme kindness to us in that <br>He has blessed us with the wealth of Islaam.\" Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"By Allah, Are <br>you here only for this reason?\" \"By Allah!\", replied <br>the Sahaba, (Radhiyallaho anhum), \"We are sitting <br>here only for this reason.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) then said, \"I asked you to swear not <br>out of any misunderstanding, but because jibra-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) came to me and informed me just <br>now that Almighty Allah was speaking high about you <br>'before angels.\" <br>Note: Enquiry on oath by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br> <br>sallam) was simply to ascertain whether there was any <br>other special thing, besides zikr, which might be the cause <br>of Allah's pride. It became definite that it was only because <br>of the zikr of Almighty Allah that He was proud of them. <br>How lucky were those people whose worship was ac-<br>cepted, and the news of Allah's recognition of the zikr on <br>their part was revealed to them in this very earthly life <br>through Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Certainly, <br>their sublime deeds deserved all this appreciation. Their <br>heroic deeds are briefly described in my book named <br>Hikaayaat-e- Sahabah, (i.e. The Stories of Sahabah). Mulla <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) interprets the pride on the <br>part of Almighty Allah to mean that He wants the angels to <br>realize, \"Despite the fact these humans are full of tempta- <br>tions, the Devil is after them, desires are inside them, the <br>worldly needs chase them, and yet they are engaged in <br>glorifying Almighty Allah, and so many deterrents cannot <br>prevent them from doing zikr: and therefore your zikr and <br>glorification, in the absence of any such handicaps is com- <br>paratively insignificant.\" <br>Hadith No 10 <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reported that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"When <br>some people assemble for the zikr of Allah with the <br>sole purpose of earning His pleasure, an angel pro- <br>claims from the sky, 'You people have been forgiven, <br>your sins have been replaced by virtues.\" According to <br>another hadith, \"A gathering devoid of zikr of Allah, <br>would be the cause of dismay and sorrow on the Day <br>of Judgement.\" It means that the participants of such a <br>gathering will repent that they earned no blessings and <br>wasted their time for nothing; may be, it led them to af- <br>flictions. In another hadith, it is stated that the mem- <br>bers of a gathering devoid of zikr of Allah and salawaat <br>on Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) are- like <br>those who get up from the dead body of an ass. <br>According to another hadith, one should get the va- <br>riour transgressions (unwittingly) committed in a gath- <br>Ch.I: Ahaadith on Zikr<br>ering condoned by reciting the following prayer at the <br>conclusion of the meeting: <br>\"Glory be to Allah with all kinds of praises. Glory be to <br>Thee, 0 Allah! with all Thy Praise; I stand witness that <br>there is no one to be worshipped except Thee. I seek Thy <br>forgiveness and turn (for mercy) to Thee.\" <br>It is narrated in another hadith that any gathering <br>devoid of Allah's zikr and salawaat will be a source of <br>dismay and loss. Then, out of His sheer mercy, Allah may <br>grant forgiveness, or He may demand an explanation and <br>3 3  <br>penalize. It is stated in another hadith. \"Do proper justice <br>ea <br>to a gathering by remembering Allah profusely, show the <br>way to wayfarers (if need be), and close your eyes or cast <br>them down when you come across a forbidden thing. <br>Hadhrat Ali (Karamallaaho Wajhahoo) said, \"Whoso- <br>ever desires that his reward be weighed on the Day of <br>Judgement in a large scale (i.e. his reward should be very <br>big, as only weighty things, and not the small things, are <br>weighed in big scales), should recite the following prayer at <br>the end of a meeting: <br>(Glory) to Thy Lord-The Lord of Honour And Power. (He <br>is free) from what they ascribe (to Him). And peace be on <br>the apostles, and Praise to Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of <br>the Worlds). <br>The above hadith also includes the happy tidings that <br>the sins will be replaced by virtues. Even in the Holy <br>Qur'an, at the end of surah al-Furqaan, Almighty Allah <br>mentions the good qualities of the believers and then says: <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>As for such. Allah will change their evil deeds to good <br>deeds: and Allah is ever forgiving and most merciful. <br>The following are some comments made by the com- <br>mentators on this verse:- <br>1. All sins would be forgiven and only virtues would <br>remain (in the account); that no sin is left behind <br>(in the account) is itself a big change. <br>2. <br>Almighty Allah will enable them to do good deeds <br>when otherwise they would have committed bad <br>deeds, just as it is sometimes said, \"the heat was <br>replaced by the cold.\" <br>3. Their habits become related to virtues instead of <br>vices, so much so that doing good deeds becomes <br>their habit. Habits once formed become second <br>nature, which does not change. The Persian pro- <br>verb meaning that \"The mountain can move, but <br>not the habit\" refers to this fact. This proverb is <br>also derived from another hadith, \"You may be- <br>lieve if you hear that a mountain has moved from <br>its place, but do not believe if you are told that the <br>habits of somebody have changed.\" This hadith <br>implies that the change of a habit is more unli.kely <br>than a mountain changing its place. The question <br>then arises what is meant when it is said that the <br>Sufis and religious teachers reform the behaviour <br>of their disciples. The answer is that habits do not <br>change, but the relationship of habits changes. For <br>instance, if a man's temperament is such that he! is <br>prone to anger, it is difficult for him to get rid of <br>his hot temperament through the training and <br>excercises under the supervisio~l of the Shaikhs, <br>but they would reform him in such a way that, <br>whereas formerly his anger led him to show un- <br>justified cruelty and haughtiness, it will now be <br>directed against transgression of Allah's com-<br>mandments. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) at <br>one time had left no stone unturned in molesting <br>the Muslims, but after embracing Islaam and re-<br>maining in the company of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) he became correspondingly hard <br>on the unbelievers and transgressors. So is the <br>case with other aspects of one's conduct. This <br>clarification leads us to the conclusion that <br>I <br>\\ <br>I <br>i <br><br>Ch. I:.Ahaadith on Zikr <br>4. <br>Almighty Allah shifts the direction of the conduct <br>of such people from vices to virtues. <br>Almighty Allah guides him to repent for his sins. <br>He recollects his old sins, repents over them and <br>prays for forgiveness. Thus, for every sin pre-<br>viously committed, he gets the credit of one repen- <br>tance, which constitues a devotion and a virtue. <br>5. If Allah is pleased with the good deeds of some- <br>body, and through His sheer benevolence grants <br>him virtues equal to his sins, there is nobody to <br>question His authority. He is the Lord, He is the <br>King, He is All powerful, His mercy is boundless. <br>Who can close the door of His forgiveness? Who <br>can stop His bounty? He gives everything from His <br>own treasures. He will exhibit His powers and un- <br>limited forgiveness on the Day of Judgement. Vari- <br>ous scenes of reckoning on the Day of Judgement <br>are described in ahaadith, as briefly given in the <br>book, Bahjatun Nufoos. It is mentioned that reck- <br>oning will be conducted in different ways. \"Some <br>people will be examined in camera under the <br>cover of (secret) Mercy: their sins will be re-<br>counted to them, they will be reminded of the oc- <br>casion when each sin was committed by them and <br>there will be no alternative for them but to confess <br>all their sins. Due to the abundance of his sins. he <br>will think that he is doomed. but the Lord will <br>say, \"I covered your sins during the worldly life <br>and again I cover them now, and forgive them all.\" <br>When such a person, along with others like him, <br>will return from the place of reckoning, the people <br>will see him and exclaim, \"What a blessed person, <br>he never committed any sin,\" because they will <br>have no knowledge of his sins. Similarly, in an- <br>other mode of reckoning, the people will have <br>minor as well as major sins to their account. Then, <br>Almighty Allah will order that their minor sins <br>may be converted into virtues, at which they (in <br>order to get more virtues) will exclaim that many <br>of their sins are not mentioned in their account. In <br>the same way, the modes of reckoning \"are also <br>mentioned in ahaadith. An anecdote is mentioned <br>in one hadith, wherein Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said. \"I recog-<br>% <br>8.2 <br>gz<br>$ <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>nise the person who will be transferred from the <br>Hell to the Paradise last of all. He will be sum- <br>moned, and the angels will be directed that his <br>major sins should not be mentioned and that only <br>his minor sins should be read out, and he should <br>be asked to give explanation for them. This trial <br>will start, and his sins will be recounted to him <br>with time and place. How can he deny them? He <br>will confess them all. Almighty Allah will then <br>order that for every sin he may be given one <br>virtue. At this, the man will speak out at once, <br>\"There are still many sins that have not been men- <br>tioned so far.\" While narrating this part of the <br>story, even Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) smiled. Firstly, to be the last one to come out <br>of the Hell, as mentioned in this narrative, does <br>not mean a light punishment; secondly, it is not <br>known as to who will be that lucky one whose <br>sins will be converted into virtues. Hoping for the <br>best from Almighty Allah and constantly begging <br>for His mercy constitute the best form of submis- <br>sion. But one should never be over-complacent in <br>this matter. However, the above-mentioned hadith <br>shows that taking part in meetings of zikr with <br>ikhlaas leads to replacement of sins by virtues. But <br>this ikhlaas is possible only through the grace of <br>Almighty Allah. <br>The main point contained in this hadith is that of <br>ikhlaas (i.e. doing a thing only for the pleasure 'of <br>Allah). That ikhlaas is the pre-requisite for all good <br>deeds will be found in several other ahaadith in this <br>book. In fact, the acceptance by Almighty Allah de- <br>pends only on ikhlaas: every deed will be evaluated <br>according to the degree of ikhlaas involved therein. <br>According to the Sufis, ikhlaas on one's part requires <br>i<br>that one's words, thoughts and deeds should be com- <br>patible. It will be found in one hadith that ikhlaas is <br>that which prevents one from committing sin. <br>A story of a despotic king who was notorious for <br>I <br>his tyranny and cruelty is related in the book \"Bahja- <br>tun Nufoos.\" Once. a large consignment of wine was <br>being brought for him in a ship. A pious man who hap- <br>pened to travel by that ship broke all the bottles or <br>I <br>casks of wine except one, but nobody could stop him <br>4 7 <br>from that act. Everybody wondered how he dared to do <br>this, for nobody had the courage to face the cruelty of <br>the king. When the king was informed about it, he was <br>surprised to learn how an ordinary person had the <br>courage to do all that and also wondered why he left <br>one cask intact. The man was called for, and interro- <br>gated. He replied, \"My conscience had urged me to do <br>this; you may punish me as you like.\" He was then <br>asked why one cask was left unbroken? He replied, \"At <br>first I broke the casks of wine out of my religous senti- <br>ments, but when only one was left, my heart felt elated <br>at having done something forbidden by religion. I then <br>felt that breaking this last cask would be for the satis- <br>faction of my ego. I, therefore, did not break it.\" Find- <br>ing him selfless in what he did, the king ordered his -<br>release. <br>o <br>It is narrated in Ihyaa-ul Uloom that there was a <br>B.k2 <br>pious man among the Israelites, who always remained <br>g 3  <br>busy in the worship of Allah. A group of people came <br>to him and told him that a tribe living nearby <br>worshipped a tree. The news upset him, and with an <br>axe on his shou der he went to cut down that tree. On <br>the way, Satan I et him in the form of an old man and <br>asked him where he was going. He said he was going <br>to cut a particular tree. Satan said, \"You are not con- <br>cerned with this tree, you better mind your worship <br>and do not give it up for the sake of something that <br>does not concern you.\" \"This is also worship\", re-<br>torted the worshipper. Then Satan tried to prevent him <br>from cutting the tree, and there followed a bout be- <br>tween the two, in which the worshipper overpowered <br>the Satan. Finding himself completely helpless, Satan <br>begged to be excused, and when the worshipper re- <br>leased him, he again said, \"Allah has not made the cut- <br>ting of this tree obtigatory on you. You do not lose <br>anything if you do not cut it. If its cutting were necess- <br>ary. Allah could have got it done through one of his <br>many Apostles.\" The worshipper insisted on cutting <br>the tree. There was again a bout between the two and <br>again the worshipper overpowered the Satan. \"Well, <br>listen\" said the Satan, \"I propose a settlement that will <br>be to your advantage.\" The worshipper agreed, and the <br>Satan said, \"You are a poor man, a mere burden on <br>this earth. If you desist from this act, I will pay you <br>three gold coins everyday. You will daily find them <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>lying under your pillow. By this money you can fulfil <br>your own needs, can oblige your relatives, help the <br>needy, and do soamany other virtuous things. Cutting <br>the tree will be only one virtue, which will ultimately <br>be of no use because the pebple will grow another <br>tree.\" This proposal appealed to the worshipper, and <br>he accepted it. He found the money on two successive <br>days, but on the third day there was nothing. He got <br>enraged. picked up his axe and went to cut the tree. <br>The old man again met him on the way and asked him <br>where he was going. \"To cut the tree\", shouted the <br>worshipper. \"I will not let you do it\", said the Satan. <br>An encounter ensured between the two, and this time <br>the Satan had the upper-hand and overpowered the <br>worshipper. The latter was surprised at his own defeat, <br>and asked the former the cause of his success. The <br>Satan replied, \"At first, your anger was purely for earn- <br>ing the pleasure of Allah, and therefore Almighty <br>Allah helped you to overpower me, but now it has <br>been partly for the sake of the gold coins and therefore <br>you lost.\" Truly speaking. a deed performed purely for <br>the pleasure of Allah alone carries great force. <br>Hadith No.11 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"No <br>other action of a person can surpass zikr of Almighty <br>Allah in saving him from the punishment in the <br>grave.\" <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>Note: <br>How serious is the punishment in the rave can be <br>realized only by those who have the knowle fge of hadith <br>on this subject. Whenever Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) visited a grave, he would weep so much that his <br>beard would become wet with tears. Some one asked him, <br>\"How is it that mention of Paradise and Hell does not make <br>you weep so much as you do when you come across a <br>grave?\" He replied, \"The grave is the first of the many <br>stages of the Hereafter. For him who is successful or safe <br>during this stage, the later stages will also be easy; while <br>for a person who is not exempted in this stage, the later <br>stages will be even more difficult.\" Then he quoted Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as having said, \"I have <br>not come across any sight more terrifying than that of the 2 <br>grave.\" Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) said, that <br>(BA<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) used to pray after <br>~<br>E<br>J<br> <br>every Salaat for protection against the chastisement in the 5 <br>grave. Hadhrat Zaid (Radhiyallaho anho) reported Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said, \"But for fear <br>that you might give up burying your dead, I would have <br>prayed to Almighty Allah to let you hear the torture of the <br>grave. With the exception of men and jinns, all other crea- <br>tures hear the punishment in the grave.\" <br>According to a hadith, once when Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was going on a journey, his she- <br>camel took fright. Someone asked him what had happened <br>to her. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied that <br>somebody was being punished in the grave, and the cries of <br>the punished had frightened the she-camel. <br>Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaik wasallam) entered <br>the mosque and saw that some people were laughing very <br>loudly. He said to them, \"If you had remembered death <br>quite often, you would not have laughed like this. Not a <br>day passes when the grave does not proclaim, \"I am the <br>house of wilderness, the house of loneliness. and the abode <br>of worms and insects.\" When a true believer is buried in a <br>grave, it welcomes him, saying, \"You are welcome here, <br>you have done well to have come here. Of all the people <br>walking upon the earth, you were the dearest to me. Now <br>that you have been made over to me, you will see my excel- <br>lent behaviour.\" Then the grave expands to the farthest <br>point of sight, and a door of paradise opens into it. <br>Through this door comes the scented air of paradise. But <br><br>- <br>- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>when an unbeliever or a transgressor is buried, the grave <br>says, \"Your coming here is unwelcome and abominable. <br>You had better not come here. Of all the people who have <br>been walking upon me, I hated ypu the most. Today you <br>have been made over to me, and you will see my treat- <br>ment.\" Then it narrows down and presses him mercilessly, <br>till his ribs pierce into each other as the fingers of the two <br>hands interlock each other. Then ninety or ninety nine <br>dragons are let loose upon him, and they will continue <br>clawing at him till the Day of Resurrection. If one of those <br>serpents or dragons were to blow on the earth, it will be <br>rendered incapable of growing any grass till the Day of <br>Judgement. Then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>continued. \"The grave is either a garden out of Paradise or <br>a pit out of Hell.\" <br>Accordine to another hadith. Rasulullah lsallallaho <br>----.-<br>alaihe wasallgm) happened to pass by two grave'~. He said, <br>\"The two persons buried in these graves are being pun- <br>ished, one for back-biting and the other for polluting his <br>bodv with his urine.\" It is a pity that many of our so-called <br>civilized people regard isti4aa (washingthe private parts <br>after urination) as an undignified act, and even redicule it. <br>Some Ulama regard such pollution by urine as a major sin. <br>Ibn Hajar Makki (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that, <br>according to an authentic hadith, the punishment in the <br>grave is generally due to neglect of cleanliness from urine. <br>It is narrated in one hadith that interrogation in the <br>grave will first be about (pollution with) urine. In short, the <br>punishment of the grave is a very serious affair. Just as <br>some types of sins lead to this affliction, in the same way <br>certain virtuous acts provide special safeguard against it. It <br>is stated in several ahaadith that the recitation of surah <br>Tabarakal lazi ,every night guarantees security from the <br>tortures in the grave, as well as from that in the Hell. The <br>effectiveness of zikr in this respect is evident from the <br>above-mentioned hadith. <br>Hadith No. 51 <br>. <br>L <br>\\.Xi31j S! 41<br>u ;,p 3i <br>+UI j,;-lipJJGJ, <br>,. <br>., -<br>y<br>&<br> <br>A;$\\ 3:.gJ\\;&d <br>2 ;\\;i <br>,$ +;j > >> ,& +$c <br>.<br>dl &\\3. 1s A\\ 3 +ul;<br>JG A\\ 3 i > ~ . ,;JG- A\\ 2 i;&;\\<br>rl'. -<br>, 0<br>,<br> <br>i)Stf.J.\\j I4 u& J ~lljl\\p j(ij <br>J F,: <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, <br>(r0 <br>\"Almighty Allah will, on the Day of Resurrection, res- e3<br>urrect certain groups of people in such a state that <br>their faces will be radiant with light, they will be sit- <br>ting on pulpits of pearls and others will envy their lot. <br>They will neither be from among the Prophets nor <br>from among the martyrs.\" <br>Somebody asked the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to let him have <br>more details about these people, so that he may be able <br>to recognize them. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) replied, \"They will be the people who belong to <br>different families and different places, but assemble at <br>one place for the love of Almighty Allah and are en- <br>gaged in His zikr.\" <br>It is said in another hadith, \"In paradise there will be <br>pillars of emerald supporting balconied houses made of <br>rubies and with open doors on all the four sides. These will <br>shine like brilliant stars, and will be occupied by those <br>people who love each other for the sake of Allah, and who <br>assemble at a place and meet each other only for His pleas- <br>ure. <br>Nowadays, the religious devotees are criticizd and <br>ridiculed by everybody. The people may reproach them <br>today as much as they like, but the reality will dawn on <br>them in the Hereafter, when they will realize how these <br>humble persons have been able to earn high fortunes and <br>occupy such grand pulpits and such flats, whereas those <br>who criticized and ridiculed them had earned nothing but <br>misery and despair: <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>\"Soon the dust-cloud will clear away, and it will be <br>seen whether vou are riding a horse or an ass.\" <br>How blessed. in the eyes of Almighty Allah, are the <br>khanqahs (places where zikr is practised), which are the <br>targets of abuse from all quarters. can best be judged from <br>this hadith in their favour. It is mentioned in one hadith <br>that the houses where zikr is practised shine unto the <br>dwellers of the Heaven, as do the stars shine unto the in- <br>habitants of the Earth. According to another hadith, sakee- <br>nah (a very special blessing) descends on the gathering <br>engaged in zikr, the angels surround them, the divine <br>mercy covers them, and Almighty Allah mentions them on <br>His Throne. <br>Hadhrat Abu Razeen (Radhiyallaho anho) a Sahabi, <br>narrated that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said.!\"Shall I tell you something that will strengthen your <br>Imaan and earn you the blessings of Allah, the Great, in <br>both the worlds? It is the gatherings of those who do zikr of <br>Almighty Allah; you should make it a point to take part in <br>them, and when you are alone, do as much zikr as you <br>can.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) has ex-<br>plained that the houses in which zikr is done appear to be <br>as bright and shining as are the stars to the dwellers of the <br>Earth. These houses are so bright because of their light of <br>zikr, they shine like the stars. There are people who are en- <br>dowed by Almighty Allah with spiritual insight and are <br>capable of seeing this light in this very world. There &re <br>some who can recognise the spiritual persons and their <br>houses from the special radiance emitted by them. Hadhrat <br>Fudhail bin Iyaadh, (Kahmatullah alaih) a famous saint, <br>has said that the houses in which zikr is practised shine <br>like a lamp unto the dwellers of the Heavens. Sheikh <br>Abdul Aziz Dabbaagh, a saint of recent times, was illiterate <br>but he could clearly distinguish between the verses of the <br>Qur'an, Hadith Qudsi, and Hadith Nabawi. Me used to say <br>that words coming out from the mouth of the speaker carry <br>a distinguishing glow and that the words of Almighty Allah <br>carrv one kind of radiance and the words of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) carry another kind of radiance, <br>while the words of others are devoid of these two tvpes of <br>radiance. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>It is given in Tazkiratul Khaleel, the biography of Mau- <br>lana Khaleel Ahmad (May Allah enlighten his grave) that <br>Maulana Zafar Ahmad had related, \"When Maulana Kha- <br>lee1 Ahmad, on the occasion of his fifth Hajj, entered the <br>Masjidul Haraam for Tawaaful Qudoom, I was sitting in the <br>company of Maulana Muhibbuddeen, who was one of the <br>most trusted disciples of Maulana al-Haaj Imdaadullah Mu- <br>haajir Makki (May Allah enlighten his grave) and was well <br>known for his gift of divine foresight. He was then engaged <br>in his usual recitation of salawaat from a book, when all of <br>a sudden he turned to me and said, \"Who has entered the <br>Haram? The whole of the Haram has been flooded with his <br>radiance and light.\" I kept quiet. After a short while, Mau- <br>lana Khaleel Ahmad after completing his tawaaf happened <br>to pass by us. On seeing him Maulana Muhibbuddeen <br>stood up, smiled and said, \"Now indeed I see who has en- <br>tered the Haram today! \" <br>2 2<br>EN<br>The virtues of assembling for the sake of zikr have <br>been described in different ways in so many other ahaa- <br>dith. In one hadith, it is stated that salaat and gatherings for <br>zikr constitute the best ribaat. Ribaat stands for guarding <br>the boundaries of Daarus Salaam (the Muslim territory) <br>against invasion by the infidels. <br>Hadith No 13 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When <br>you pass the gardens of Paradise, graze to your heart's <br>content.\" Someone asked. \"0 Kasulullah! (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), what is meant by the gardens of <br>Paradise?\" He replied, \"Gatherings for performing <br>zikr.\" <br>What is meant is that if somebodv is lucky enough to <br>get access to such gatherings. he should take full advantage <br>of this, as these are the gardens of Paradise on this Earth. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>The words, \"graze to your heart's content\", signify that, <br>just as an animal grazing in a green pasture or garden does <br>not give up grazing in spite of being driven or beaten by its <br>owner, similarly a zaakir (one who practises zikr) should <br>not get pulled away from the gatherings for zikr by the <br>worldly anxieties and hindrances. The gatherings for zikr <br>are likened to the gardens of Paradise, because just as there <br>are no worries in the paradise, similarly gatherings of zikr <br>are safeguarded against every kind of calamity. <br>It is stated in one hadith that the zikr of Almighty <br>Allah cures all diseases of the mind, such as arrogance, <br>jealousy, malice, etc. The author of 'Fawaa'id fis Salaah <br>wal Awaa'id' has stated that constancy in zikr is a sure <br>safeguard against all kinds of calamities. According to an- <br>other hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has <br>said, \"I enjoin on you to do zikr of Allah profusely. It is <br>like taking refuge in a fort against a strong enemy. One who <br>practises zikr is as if it were in the company of Almighty <br>Allah.\" Can there be any benefit greater than that of being <br>in the company of the Almighty Lord? Moreover, it leads to <br>satisfaction of the mind, it enlightens the heart and re-<br>moves its callousness. In addition, there are many other <br>material and spiritual benefits, which are enumerated, upto <br>a hundred, by some Ulama. <br>A man came to see Hadhrat Abu Umaamah, (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) and said to him, \"I saw in a dream that when- <br>ever you went or came out, or sat or stood up, the angels <br>prayed for you.\" Hadhrat Abu Umaamah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) replied, \"If you wish you can also earn their pray- <br>ers\", and recited the ayat: <br>i <br>\"0you who believe! celebrate the praises of Allah and <br>do this excessively and glorify Him morning and even- <br>I <br>ing. He sends blessings on you, as also His angels that <br>He may bring you out from the depths of darkness into <br>light, and He is full of Mercy to the believers.\" <br>i <br>This ayat was quoted to show that the Mercy of <br>Almighty Allah and the prayers of the angels can be earned <br>through zikr. The more we remember Allah, the more He <br>remembers us. <br><br>Hadith No 14 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"One <br>who is too weak to bear the strain of keeping awake at <br>night (in the worship of Almighty Allah), is too mi- <br>serly to spend his wealth in the path of Allah, and is <br>$ <br>8 2<br>too cowardly to take part in jihaad, is advised to <br>g~<br>remain engaged in the zikr of Allah.\" <br>i' <br>This shows that deficiencies in respect of non-obliga- <br>tory form of worship can be atoned through profuse zikr of <br>Almighty Allah. Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) re-<br>purted that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>said, \"Zikr of Allah is a sign of Imaan, and it ensures <br>exemption from hypocrisy, and provides a safeguard <br>against the devil and protection from the fire of Hell.\" Be- <br>cause of all these benefits, zikr has been regarded as more <br>virtuous than many other forms of worship; it is specially <br>effective in providing protection against the Devil. It is <br>stated in one hadith that the Devil, in a kneeling position, <br>clings to the heart of a man, and when the man remembers <br>Almighty Allah the devil becomes helpless and frustrated <br>and therefore draws back, but whenever he finds the man <br>neglecting it he pollutes the heart with evil thoughts. It is <br>for this reason that the Sufis advise practising zikr excess- <br>ively, so that the heart remains free from evil thoughts and <br>becomes strong enough to resist the Devil. The Sahaba <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum) who had developed this inner <br>strength through the blessed company of Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) did not stand in such great need of <br>exercising zikr, but with the passage of time after Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) this resistive power of the <br>heart became weaker and weaker, and the need to remedy <br>this weakness through zikr became correspondingly <br>greater. In the present age, the hearts have become so de- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I <br>generate that no amount of treatment can restore their <br>strength to compare with that of the Sahabah. Nevertheless, <br>whatever improvement is effected is worthwhile at this <br>time when the disease has taken the form of an epidemic. <br>It is related about a holy man that he prayed to <br>Almighty Allah that he may be shown how Satan prevails <br>upon the heart. He found that the Satan sits like a mosquito <br>over the left side of the heart under the back of the shoul- <br>der and then advances his needle-like snout towards the <br>heart. If he finds the heart buzy in zikr he withdraws at <br>once, but if the heart is idle he injects the poison of evil <br>and sinful thoughts into it. It is stated in one hadith that <br>Satan keeps on sitting with the top of his nose over the <br>heart, and if the heart is buzy in zikr he withdraws in dis- <br>grace, but if it is idle he makes a morsel of it. <br>Hadith No 15 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said, \"Practise zikr so excessively that people <br>may regard you as a maniac.\" It is stated in another <br>hadith \"Practise zikr so much that the hypocrite may <br>regard you as insincere.\" <br>It is clear from this hadith that the taunts of madness <br>and hypocrisy by the munaafiqs and by the foolish people <br>should not make one give up the spiritual wealth of zikr. <br>On the contrary, it should be done with such rapture and <br>abundance that those people may take you to be actually <br>mad and let you alone. They will consider you mad, only if <br>you practise zikr excessively and loudly, and not if you do <br>it quietly. <br>1 <br>b <br>!<br>I <br>I <br>I <br>l <br><br>Ibn Katheer (Rahmatullah alaih) has narrated, on the <br>authority of Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) \"Nothing has been made obligatory by Almighty <br>Allah without fixing maximum limit for it and excusing <br>shortcomings in respect of it, except His zikr, for which no <br>limit has been fixed and no person, as long as he is sane is <br>exempted from it.\" Almighty Allah has ordered in the Holy <br>Quran: <br>\"Practise zikr of Allah excessively.\" A person should <br>do zikr under all circumstances, whether by day or <br>night; whether in the jungle or at sea; whether travel- <br>ling or halting; whether in. affluence or poverty; , <br>whether in sickness or health; whether loudly or <br>quietly. <br>j&g &  <br>In his book 'Munabbihaat', Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahmatul- 5 <br>lah alaih) writes that Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho), <br>while explaining the Quranic verse <br>Beneath it there was a treasure for them <br>said that the treasure meant a golden tablet, on which were <br>written the following seven lines: <br>(1) I wonder at the man who knows that he is to die <br>and indulges in laughter. <br>(2) \t I wonder at the man who knows that this world <br>will come to an end one day, but hankers after it. <br>(3) I wonder that a man who knows that everything is <br>predestined should lament the loss of anything. <br>(4) \t I wonder that a man who believes in the reckoning <br>in the Hereafter should amass wealth. <br>(5) \t I wonder that a man who has the knowledge of the <br> \t<br>fire of the Hell should commit any sin. <br>(6) \t I wonder that a man who believes in Almighty <br>Allah should remember anybody other than Him. <br>(7) \t I wonder that a man who believes in Paradise <br>should feel pleasure in anything of this world. <br>In some editions of that book. it is also added, \"I <br>wonder that a man who knows that Satan is his eternal <br>enemy should obey and follow him.\" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hafiz (Rahmatullah alaih) has also stated on the auth- <br>ority of Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once said, \"Hazrat Jibra-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam) laid so much stress on doing zikr that I <br>felt that without zikr nothing can benefit whatsoever.\" <br>The above mentioned quotations show that one should <br>practise zikr as much as possible; giving it up simply be- <br>cause others may call one mad or a hypocrite is fraught <br>with serious loss to oneself. The Sufis have written that it <br>is also a trap on the part of Satan that at first he discourages <br>one from zikr on the plea of avoiding criticism by the <br>people and, if he succeeds in this attempt, he is encouraged <br>and exploits this fear of criticism for preventing the person <br>from doing zikr forever. Although one should not do any <br>good deed for the sake of a show, yet if anybody happens to <br>see it one should not thereupon give it up. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah Zul Bajadeen (Radhiyallaho anhb), a <br>Sahabi, became an orphan in his childhood. He lived with <br>his uncle, who looked after him well. He had embraced <br>Islaam secretly and, when his uncle came to know of it, in <br>his anger, he turned him out of the house stark naked. His <br>mother was also displeased, but she took pity on him and <br>gave him a sheet of coarse cloth, which he tore into two <br>pieces, using one piece as a lower garment and the other as <br>an upper covering for the body. He migrated to Madina, <br>where he was always found before the house of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and used to practise zikr very <br>loudly. Hadhrat Unlar (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked, \"Is <br>this man a hypocrite that he does zikr so loudly? \"No\" <br>said Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), \"He is from <br>amongst the Awwaabeen,\" i.e. those who ever turn to <br>Almighty Allah. He died in the battle of Tabook. The Saha- <br>bah saw a lamp burning in the graveyard. On approaching <br>it, they found Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>standing in the grave and asking Hadhrat Abubakr and <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anhuma) to make over their <br>brother to him. The two made over the dead body to him <br>for burial. After the burial, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) prayed, \"0 Allah! I am pleased with him, Thou <br>be also pleased with him.\" <br>On seeing this scene, Hadhrat Ibn Masood (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) wished that it should have been his corpse. <br>Hadhrat Fudhail (who was one of the great Sufis) <br>stated, \"To abstain from a virtuous act for fear of being seen <br>by the people is in itself an act of hypocrisy, and a good <br>action done with the intention to make a show amounts to <br>Shirk (false worship).\" <br>It is stated in one hadith that some persons are the <br>keys to zikr, i.e. their very sight reminds and inspires other <br>people to do zikr of Allah. According to another hadith, <br>such people are the friends of Allah whose very sight <br>makes others remember Almighty Allah. It is stated in one <br>hadith, \"The best amongst you are the people whose very <br>sight reminds you of Allah.\" Similarly it is stated in an- <br>other hadith, \"The best amongst you are those whose sight <br>makes you remember Almighty Allah, whose words add to <br>your knowledge, and whose actions induce you to work for <br>the love of the Hereafter.\" Of course, such a condition can <br>be attained by one who practises zikr profusely. One who <br>is himself indolent in this respect, his sight can hardly <br>inspire others to remember Allah. <br>2d <br>Some people regard zikr in loud voice as an innovation <br>E N  <br>i-<br>and forbidden in religion, but this view is due to lack of in- <br>sight into the knowledge of hadith. Maulana Abdul Hay, <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) has written a booklet 'Sabahatul Fikr' <br>on this very subject, wherein he has quoted about fifty <br>ahaadith in support of zikr in loud voice. However, it is <br>subject to proper limitations, so as not to annoy anybody <br>else. <br>Hadith Nu 16 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"The following seven persons will be accommo- <br>dated by Allah in the shade of His Mercy on the day <br>when there will be no other shade except His: (1)A <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>just ruler (2) A young man who worships Allah in his <br>youth (3) A person whose heart yearns for the musjid <br>(4) Those two persons who love, meet and depart only <br>for the pleasure of Allah. (5)A man who is tempted by <br>a beautiful woman and refuses to respond for fear of <br>Allah. (6)A person who gives alms so secretly that the <br>charity of one hand is not known to the other hand. (7) <br>A person who practises zikr of Allah in solitude, so <br>that tears flow of his eyes.\" <br>The flowing of tears can mean deliberate weeping, due <br>to repentance over one's past sins, but it may also mean a <br>spontaneous outburst of tears due to overwhelming passion <br>of love. Thaabit Banaani (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted <br>the words of a pious man, \"I come to know when a prayer <br>of mine is accepted.\" When asked as to how he comes to <br>know of it, he said, \"That prayer, at the time of which the <br>hair on my body stand up, my heart starts beating rapidly <br>and my eyes shed tears, is accepted by Allah.\" Among the <br>seven persons mentioned in the foregoing hadith, is in- <br>cluded also the person who weeps while doing zikr in soli- <br>tude. He combines two sublime qualities: first ikhlaas, <br>which makes him remember Allah in solitude, secondly <br>the fear or love of Allah, which makes him weep. Both <br>these things are extremely virtuous. According to a poet, <br>\"My work is to weep at night in remembering my be- <br>loved; and my sleep is to remain absorbed in thoughts of <br>my beloved.\" <br>('4631$i $j), (a<br>In the Arabic text of the hadith <br>person who remembers Allah when he is unoccupied), the <br>word 'unocc~~pied' <br>according to Sufis, has two- meanings. it <br>means in solitude, as is generally understood: but it also <br>signifies the heart being free from all thoughts except of <br>Almighty Allah, which constitutes the real solitude. The <br>ideal is to have both forms of solitude, physical as well as <br>mental. But if a person, even while in the company ot <br>others, has his heart free from all worldly thoughts and, <br>being absorbed in the zikr of Allah, happens to weep <br>thereby, he will also be rewarded as mentioned in this <br>i <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr<br>hadith, because the presence or absence of others makes no <br>difference to him. His heart is free from the thoughts, not <br>only of his companions, but also of everything other than <br>Almighty Allah. The presence of others cannot distract him <br>from his attention towards Allah. <br>To be able to weep for fear and love of Allah implies <br>possession of great spiritual wealth. Fortunate is he who is <br>blessed with it by Almighty Allah. It is stated in one hadith <br>that a person who weeps for fear of Allah will not be sent <br>to Hell till the milk goes back into the teats of an animal <br>(which is imposssible). This implies that it is similarly im- <br>possible for such a person to go to Hell. According to an- <br>other hadith, a person who weeps for fear of Allah will not <br>be punished on the Day of Judgement. <br>It is stated in one hadith that the fire of Hell is forbid- <br>den for two eyeszone that sheds tears for fear of Allah, and <br>the other that has remained awake in guarding the Muslims * <br>and Islaam against the infidels. In another hadith, it is <br>stated that the fire of Hell is forbidden on the eye that has <br>gN <br>wept for fear of Allah, on the eye that has remained awake <br>in the path of Allah, on the eye that has refrained from the <br>unlawful and also on the eye that has been lost in the path <br>of Allah. <br>Yet another hadith states that a person who remembers <br>Allah in solitude is like one who goes all alone to fight <br>against the infidels. <br>Hadith No 17 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasailam) said, \"An <br>announcer will call out on the Day of Judgement, <br>'Where are the wise ones?' People will enquire. 'Who <br>are meant by the wise ones?' The reply will be, 'They <br>are those who always remembered Allah, whether sit- <br>ting, standing or reclining, and pondered over the cre-<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ation of the Heaven and the Earth, and would say, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou hast not created all this in vain. We glo- <br>rify Thee: save us from the fire of Hell.\" Thereafter a <br>flag will appear for them. and they will follow this flag <br>and will be told to enter Paradise and stag for ever.\" <br>By \"pondering over the creation of the Heaven and the <br>Earth\" is meant that they contemplate over the phenomena <br>and secrets of the things created by Allah, and thereby <br>strengthen their spiritual knowledge. <br>The whole universe is like a garden planned and <br>planted by Allah. <br>As narrated by Ibn Abid Dunyaa, Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) once approached a group of Sahabah <br>who were sitting in silence. He asked them what they were <br>thinking about. The Sahabah replied that they were pon- <br>dering over the wonderful creations cf Allah. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) appreciated it and said \"Do <br>not ever meditate over the Self of Almighty Allah, (He is <br>beyond comprehension), but do meditate over His creation\" <br>Somebody once asked Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) to relate some remarkable thing about Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). She replied. \"There was noth- <br>ing about him that was not remarkable. Once he came <br>home at night and lay down in my bed. After a short while, <br>he said 'Let me pray to my Lord! Saying this, he got up, <br>performed wudhu and stood up in salaat. during which he <br>wept so profusely that tears flowed onto his chest. Then he <br>continued weeping in the same manner while performing <br>ruku and sajdah. He spent the whole night like this. till <br>Hadhrat Bilaal came to call the azaan for the morning <br>prayer. I pleaded with him. 'Almighty Allah has promised <br>you His forgiveness. then why did you weep so much?' He <br>replied, \"Should {not be a grateful slave of my Allah\", and <br>continued. \"Wby should I not pray and weep when these <br>verses have been revealed to me today: <br>? <br>01+\\L@ ........ <br>*g\\-dl+\\ & 2 4<br>h \t<br>2~J -<br>i <br>\"Lo! in the creation of heaven and earth. and in the <br>difference of night and day, are tokens (of His sover- <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>eignty) for men of understanding such as .remember <br>Allah standing, sitting and reclining . . . . <br>Then he added, 'Destruction is for the person who, in <br>spite of reading these verses, does not ponder over His cre- <br>ation.\" <br>Aamir bin Abdul Qais (Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"I <br>heard from the Sahabah not from one or two or three, but <br>from many of them-that the light and radiance of faith lies <br>in contemplation and meditation.\" Hadhrat Abu Hurairah <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrated, from Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) that a person lying on the roof of his <br>house was looking at the sky and stars for some time, and <br>then said, \"I swear by Allah and I believe there is some- <br>body who has created you all; 0 Allah! forgive me for my <br>sins.\" Thereupon Allah's mercy turned towards him and <br>he was forgiven. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said that meditation for a short duration of time is better <br>than worshipping throughout the night. Similarly, Hadhrat <br>Anas, (Radhiyallaho anho] narrated that meditation over <br>the creations of Allah is better than doing worship for <br>eighty years. Somebody asked Hadhrat Umme Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anha) as to what had been the best kind of <br>worship done by her husband, Hadhrat Abu Darda (Rad- <br>hiyallaho anho). She replied it was meditation and contem- <br>plation. According to Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said that medi- <br>tation and contemplation for a short duration of time is <br>better than worship for sixty years. It should not be de- <br>duced from the various quotations given above that medita- <br>tion obviates the necessity of worship. If anybody neglects <br>any form of worship, he is liable to the same penalty and <br>punishment, as for a fardh or waajib if a fardh or waajib is <br>abandoned, and so for a sunnat or mustahab if any of these <br>is neglected. <br>Imam Ghazaali (Rahmatullah alaih) has written that <br>meditation is held to be superior tr? zikr because, in ad- <br>dition to the essence of zikr, it includes two additional <br>things, of which one is recognition of Allah, for which <br>meditation is said to be the key, and secondly the love of <br>Allah, which is induced by deep thinking. It is this medita- <br>tion, which the Sufis call 'muraaqabah', and the virtue of <br>which is narrated in many ahaadith. <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) reported that<br>Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said silent</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>Virtues of Zikr <br>zikr, which is not heard even by the angels, is rewarded se- <br>venty times over. When, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah <br>will summon all the creation for reckoning, and the record- <br>ing angels will bring the recorded accounts of all the <br>people, Allah will ask them to verify if there is any more <br>good deed to the credit of a certain individual. They will <br>submit that they had not omitted anything from his re-<br>corded account. Allah will then say, there is yet one good <br>to his credit, which is not known to the angels, and it is his <br>zikr in silence. Baihaqi (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted on <br>the authority of Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) that <br>the zikr that is not heard even by the angels is seventy <br>times superior to the zikr that is heard by them. The fol- <br>lowing Persian couplet refers to the same thing: <br>Between the lover and the beloved, there is a code of <br>communication that is not known even to the reporting <br>angels. <br>How fortunate are the people who do not remain idle <br>from zikr even for a moment. In addition to the reward that <br>they will get for their outward prayers, their zikr and medi- <br>tation throughout their life will earn for them seventy times <br>extra reward. It is for this reason that the devil remains <br>worried. <br>Hadhrat Junaid (Rahmatullah alaih) is stated to have <br>seen Satan starkanaked in a dream. He asked him whether <br>he did not feel ashamed of the men around him. \"Are these <br>men?\" replied the devil, \"The men are those who are sit- <br>ting in the mosque of Shonezia, who have worried me so <br>much that my body has become lean and thin, and my <br>heart is burnt.\" Hadhrat Junaid (Rahamatullah alaih) writes <br>that he went to the mosque of Shonezia and saw that a few <br>i <br>men sitting there were deeply absorbed in meditation. <br>When they saw Hadhrat Junaid (Rahamatullah alaih) they <br>told him not to be misled by the deceptive words of the <br>wicked Satan. Similar to this, Masoohi (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>has also written about a dream. On seeing Satan in naked <br>condition, he asked him whether he did not feel ashamed <br>of being naked in the midst of men. The Satan replied, \"By <br>I <br>I <br>I<br>God! if they were men, I would not have toyed with them <br>as do the boys with their playball, Real men are those who <br>made me ill\", and he pointed to the group of Sufis. Abu <br>Sa'eed Khazzaar (Rahmatullah alaih) also states that he <br>once saw in a dream that Satan attacked him and he tried <br>to beat him back with a stick, but the Satan did not care for <br>this beating. Then he heard a heavenly voice saying that <br>the devil is not scared away by the beating, he is only <br>frightened by the spiritual light in one's heart. <br>Hadhrat Sa'od (Radhiyallaho anho) quoted Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said, \"The best zikr is <br>the silent one, and the best livelihood is that which just <br>suffices\", (i.e. it should neither be too insufficient to make <br>both ends meet, nor too abundant as to drive one to vanity <br>and vice). In another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is reported to have said. \"Remember Allah <br>O <br>through perfect zikr\". When somebody enquired; \"What is <br>perfect zikr.\" He replied, \"Silent zikr.\" All the above <br>quoted narrations establish the excellence of zikr in si- ji<br>lence. We have also read the hadith that favours loud zikr, <br>as of a mad man. Either form of zikr is important under dif- <br>ferent sets of conditions. It is for the Shaikh (religious <br>guide) of a person to prescribe the best form of zikr for him <br>at a particular time. <br>Hadith No.18 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>house when the verse <br>was in his <br>Keep yourself bound to the company of those who <br>invoke their Lord, morning and evening <br>was revealed to him. On this revelation, he went out in <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>search of such people; he found a group of men who were <br>engaged in zikr. Some of them were with dishevelled hair, <br>parched skins, and clad in a single cloth i.e. except for the <br>loin cloth, the whole body was naked. On seeing them, Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) sat down by them <br>and said, \"All praise is for Allah who has created in my <br>ummah such people that I have been ordered to sit in their <br>company.\" <br>According to aiother hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) went out in search of them and found <br>them in the farthest part of the mosque, where they were <br>busy in zikr of Almighty Allah. He said, \"All praise is for <br>Allah Who has created, during my lifetime, such people <br>that I have been ordered to sit with them.\" Then he con- <br>tinued, \"My life and death is with you\" (i.e. You are my <br>companions in life and death.) It is mentioned in one <br>hadith that a group of Sahabah, including Hadhrat Salmaan <br>Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho) were engaged in zikr of Allah, <br>when Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) came to <br>them. They became all silent. In reply to his enquiry as to <br>what they were doing, they submitted that they were prac- <br>tising zikr of Allah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"I saw that the mercy of Allah was descending upon <br>you, and so 1 desired that I should join your company. Al- <br>hamdu lillah (All praise is for Allah)\" he then continued, <br>\"Almighty Allah has raised such pecple in my ummah that <br>He ordered me to sit in their company.\" <br>It is from such orders of Almighty Allah that the Sufis <br>have deduced that the Shaikh should also sit with his dis- <br>ciples. In addition to the benefit. that will thereby accrue to <br>the disciples, it will provide good excercise for the person <br>of the Shaikh. In the effort to tolerate the vulgarities of the <br>uncivilized and uninitiated .people, his ego will undergo <br>severe strain, and thereby he will develop humbleness in <br>him. In addition to this, the get-together of the hearts is im- <br>portant for attracting the mercy and grace of Almighty <br>Allah. It was for this reason that offering prayers in congre- <br>gation was started, and this is why all the pilgrims (in uni- <br>form appearance) are made to pray to Allah together at the <br>same time, in the valley of Arafat. This point has been re- <br>peatedly and specially stressed by Shah Waliullah (Kahma- <br>tullah alaih) in his book, Hujjatullaahil Baalighah. <br>All these virtues, as mentioned in many ahaadith, <br>relate to the group of people who are engaged in zikr. On <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>the other hand, if somehow one happens to be in a group of <br>the negligent, and even there he keeps busy with zikr of <br>Allah, great reward is also promised for him, as stated in <br>many ahaadith. On such occasions, it is all the more <br>necessary that one should remain absorbed in remem-<br>brance of Allah, so that he is immune from the evil effect of <br>such company. <br>According to one hadith, a person who remains en- <br>gaged in zikr, while in the company of the negligent is like <br>one who remains steadfast in his allotted position in a <br>jihaad (holy war), while his companions are fleeing for <br>their lives. In another hadith, he is like one who fights the <br>infidels single-handed, after his companions have fled <br>away. He is also likened to a lamp in a dark house or a <br>beautiful green tree in autumn, when all the trees have <br>%<br>shed their leaves. Almighty Allah will show him before- <br>hand his abode in the Paradise; all his sins, even if equal to <br>2 +<br>the number of all men and animals, will be forgiven. All <br>these rewards are subject to the condition that one remains g h  <br>engaged in zikr while in the company of the negligent; <br>otherwise it is forbidden even to join in such meetings. <br>According to one hadith, one should keep away from <br>those so-called friendly gatherings where there is nothing <br>but idle talk and merrymaking. A pious man once took his <br>negro maid-servant to the bazaar. He left her at a place and <br>asked her to await for his return there; went about the <br>market. When he returned, he was upset to find her miss- <br>ing. He went home, when he found the maid-servant was <br>already there. She came to him and said. '0 Master! do not <br>be angry with me in the haste; you left me in the midst of <br>people who were absolutely negligent in the remembrance <br>of Allah; I feared lest some calamity should befall them, or <br>the Earth should devour them. and I too be buried along <br>with them.\" <br>Hadith No. 19 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said that <br>Almighty Allah says, \"Do My zikr for some time after</p></div>"

We lose nothing if we remember Allah <br>for a little while after Fajr and after Asr, because so many <br>virtues have been mentioned for doing zikr at these two <br>times. When Almighty Allah promises His full help, what <br>more is needed? <br>According to one hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) has said, \"I prefer sitting with those who remain <br>busy in remembering Allah after Fajr prayer up to sunrise, <br>to the noble act of setting four Arab slaves free; and simi- <br>larly I prefer sitting with ths group who remain busy in <br>zikr !of Allah after Asr salaat up to sunset to setting four <br>slaves free.\" According to another hadith, if a person offers <br>Fajr salaat in congregation and remains engaged in zikr of <br>Allah until sunrise, and then offers two rakaats of nafl <br>salaat, his reward will equal to that of a perfect Hajj and <br>Umrah. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also <br>stated to have said, \"offering Fajr salaat in congregation, <br>and then remaining busy in zikr until sunrise, is more pre- <br>cious to me than this world and all that it contains. Simi- <br>larly, remaining busy in zikr with a group after Asr till <br>sunset is preferred by me to this world and everything that <br>it contains.\" It is for this reason that the time after Fajr and <br>Asr prayers is specially reserved for zikr as a matter of rou- <br>tine by the Sufis. Especially, the time after Fajr prayer is <br>also reserved for zikr, even by the Fuqahaa i.e. the Muslim <br>jurists. <br>I<br>It is stated in the book 'Mudawwanah' on the authority <br>of Imaam Maalik (Ral~matullali alaih) that it is makrooh <br>i<br>(undesirable) to indulge in talking during the time between <br>i<br>Fajr and sxnrise. From amongst the Hsnafees the author of <br>Durrul Mukhtaar also regarded it undesirable to indulge in <br>talking during this time. According to one hadith, if after <br>Fajr prayer a person continues to sit in the same posture <br>before talking, recites the following kalimah ten times, ten <br>virtues will be recorded to his account, ten sins remitted, <br>his position in Paradise raised by ten degrees, and he will <br><br>be protected from the Devil and other undesirables <br>throughout the day. <br>Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah; He is one, <br>and He has no partner. This world and the Hereafter belong <br>to Him and He is worthy of all praise; life and death are <br>controlled by Him, and He controls the destiny of every- <br>thing. <br>According to another hadith, whosoever, after Fajr and <br>Asr, recites three times the following prayer: <br>I seek pardon of Allah, except whom there is nobody <br>worthy of worship and Who is living and eternal; I turn to <br>Him. <br>All his sins, even if big like the sea, will be forgiven. <br>Hadith No. 20 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"The <br>world and all it contents, are accursed (i.e. are devoid <br>of Allah's mercy), except the folowing three: <br>(1) zikr of Allah and everything that is near it, <br>(2) the (Religious) aalim, and, <br>(3) the student (the seeker of religious knowledge).\" <br>The first may mean either the things near to zikr of <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Allah, in which case all the things that are helpful in doing <br>zikr, such as eating and drinking in reasonable quantities, <br>and all other necessities of life, as also all forms of worship <br>are implied therein; or it may mean the things near to <br>Allah, in which case it will mean all forms of worship of <br>Allah, and the zikr would mean special form of zikr. In <br>both cases, 'ilm is included therein, because in the first <br>case, it is 'ilm that leads one to zikr, and whereas an ignor- <br>ant man cannot recognize.Allah and in the second case be- <br>cause 'ilm (i.e. religious knowledge) is the best form of <br>worship. In spite of this, the 'aalim and the student have <br>been specially mentioned separately for emphasis. 'ilm, <br>indeed, is a great wealth. <br>According to one hadith, \"Learning 'ilm just for the <br>pleasure of Allah is a proof of the fear of Allah, travelling <br>in search of it is a worship, memorizing it is like glorifying <br>Allah, making research in it is like jihaad, reading it is like <br>chari!~, and teaching it to one's members of family pro- <br>motes nearness to Allah. This is because 'ilm enables one <br>to distinguish between right and wrong; it is the road sign <br>indicating the way to Paradise: it provides consolation in <br>wilderness and a conlpanion while travelling, because <br>reading a book serves this dual purpose. Further, it is like a <br>companion to talk to in solitude, a guide during pain and <br>pleasure, and a weapon for friends against foes. Because of <br>this, Almighty Allah raises the position of Ulama, because <br>they propagate the right, provide a lead for others. so that <br>with their deeds, and their advice be sought and acted <br>upon in all matters. The angels love to befriend them. and <br>rub their wings over them to be blessed or to show love. All <br>things, whether of land or in sea, including fish in the sea, <br>beasts of the jungle. animals and even poisonous insects <br>and reptiles like the snakes, pray for their forgiveness. All <br>this is because 'ilm is a light for the heart as well as for the <br>eyes: it urges one to be one of the best personalities of the <br>ummat, and enables one to attain high position in this life <br>as also in the Hereafter. Its study is as virtuous as fasting, <br>and its memorising is like offering Tahajjud prayer. It pro- <br>motes good relations: and it helps distinguish between <br>right and wrong; it is a prerequisite for good deeds and <br>controls them. The blessed are inspired by it and the ac- <br>cursed are deprived of it.\" <br>' <br>Though some authorities have questioned the overall <br>authenticity of this hadith, yet the virtues mentioned <br>1 I \t<br>I <br>I <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>herein are by parts corroborated by many other ahaadith. In <br>fact, many additional virtues are mentioned in the books of <br>ahaadith, let alone the foregoing accounting for the specific <br>mention of the 'aalim' and the student in the fore-men- <br>tioned hadith. <br>Hafiz Ibn Qayyim (Rahmatullah alaih), a well-known <br>muhaddith, has written an authentic book, named 'al-Waa- <br>bilus Sayyib', on the virtues of zikr. He has stated therein <br>that the virtues of zikr are more than one hundred and he <br>has listed seventy nine of these, which are briefly given <br>below in the same order. Some of these include multiple <br>benefits, and for this reason their actual number is more <br>than one hundred: <br>(1) Zikr keeps \t away the Satan and weakens his <br>L. <br>strength. \t<br>o <br>m L<br>2 4<br>(2) \t It is the cause of Almighty Allah's pleasure. <br>Z N<br>.-+<br>(3) \t It relieves the mind of anxieties and worries. <br>(4) \t It produces joy and happiness in the heart. <br>(5) \t It strengthens the body and the mind. <br>(6) \t It brightens the face and the heart. <br>(7) \t It attracts one's sustenance. <br>(8) \t It invests the zaakirs with awe and sweetness so <br>that the seeing eye is filled with awe and pleasure <br>at his sight. <br>(9) \t It induces love for Allah, which in fact is the spirit <br>of Islaam and the pivot of deen, and the source of <br>success and salvation in the Hereafter. He who <br>seeks access to the love of Almighty Allah should <br>do zikr profusely. Just as reading and repetition is <br>the door of knowledge, so zikr of Allah is the gate- <br>way to His love. <br>(10)Zikr \t involves muraaqabah (deep meditation), <br>through which one reaches the stage of Ihsaan, <br>wherein a person worships Almighty Allah as if <br>he is actually seeing Him. (The attainment of this <br>stage of Ihsaan is the ultimate objective of the <br>Sufis). <br>(11)It helps realization of Allah so that by and by a <br>stage is reached when he comes to regard <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i <br>Almighty Allah as his sole Cherisher, Guardian <br>and Master, and he turns unto Him, in all afflic- <br>tions. <br>I <br>(12) It is the key to nearness to Almighty Allah; the <br>greater the zikr, the greater the nearness to Allah, <br>and greater the indifference to zikr, the greater the <br>distance from Him. <br>(13)It opens the door of Ma'rifat (realization) of Allah. <br>(14)It makes one realize the greatness and grandeur of <br>Almighty Allah, and strengthens the conscious- <br>ness of his omni-presence. <br>(15)Zikr of Allah causes one's mention in the Court of <br>Allah, as said in the Holy Book. <br>% <br>Remember me, and I will remember you, <br>and as stated in a hadith <br>I <br>Whosoever remembers me in his heart, I remember <br>, <br>him in My heart. <br>I<br>! <br>It has already been explained under other verses <br>and ahaadith that, even if there were no other <br>good points in zikr, except that mentioned above, <br>this alone would have established its superiority <br>over others. Nevertheless, there are many more <br>virtues and benefits of zikr. <br>(16)It gives life to the heart. Hafiz Ibn Taimiyah (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) says that zikr is as necessary for <br>the heart as water for the fish. Imagine the con- <br>dition of a fish out of water. <br>(17) It is food for the heart and the soul; depriving <br>them of zikr is like depriving the body of its food. <br>(18)It cleanses the heart of its rust. It has been men- <br>tioned in an earlier hadith; everything .rusts <br>according to its nature; and the heart rusts with <br>wordly desires and indifference, to purify it zikr is <br>necessary. <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>(19) It safeguards against pitfalls and lapses. <br>(20) The heart of a neglectful person is tormented by a <br>feeling of remoteness from Allah, and nothing <br>other than zikr can rid the heart of this feeling. <br>(21) The words of zikr keep on moving round the Arsh <br>of Almighty Allah, as stated in a hadith. <br>(22) If one remembers Allah in happiness, Almighty <br>Allah remembers him in his afflictions. <br>(23) It is a means to deliverance from Allah's punish- <br>ment. <br>(24) It causes Allah's peace and mercy to descend, <br>while angels surround the person engaged in zikr. <br>(25) It saves the tongue from indulging in backbiting, <br>loose talk, lies and abuses. It is a common experi- <br>ence that a man whose tongue remains engaged in <br>zikr does not commit these absurdities. On the <br>other hand, the tongue that is not used in zikr, <br>falls an easy prey to all kinds of useless talk. <br>'z-<br>9 3 <br>y N <br>S <br>(26) The gatherings of zikr are gathering of angels, and <br>gatherings without zikr are gatherings of Satan. A <br>person is free to have a choice between the two, <br>and verily man, by instinct, is drawn towards <br>what is akin to his temperament. <br>(27)By virtue of zikr, the zaakir is blessed, as also the <br>person sitting by him. Similarly the indolent <br>person is accursed for his indolence, as also the <br>person sitting by him. <br>(28) Zikr will save one from despair on the Day of <br>Judgement. This is confirmed by one of the ahaa- <br>dith which says that the gathering devoid of <br>Allah's zikr will cause sorrow and losses on that <br>day. <br>(29) If zikr is shared by tears and repentance in loneli- <br>ness the zaakir will be blessed under the shadow <br>of Allah's throne on the Day of Judgement, when <br>hearts will jump to lips due to agony of intolerable <br>heat of that day. <br>(30)Those who remain busy in zikr are better re-<br>warded by Allah than those who remain busy in <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>du'aa and supplication. According to one hadith, <br>Almighty Allah says that I will give better reward <br>to one who is abstained by his engagements in zikr <br>from making du'aa than all those who find time <br>for making du'aa. <br>(31)In spite of the fact that zikr is the easiest f ~ r l i iof <br>worship (the movement of the tongue being easier <br>than the movement of any other party of the body), <br>yet it is the most virtuous form. <br>(32)Allah's zikr helps the plants of Paradise to grow. <br>(33)Of all actions the reward and forgiveness promised <br>for zikr is the highest. According to one hadith if <br>on any day a person repeats one hundred times <br>the kalimah: <br>There is none worthy of worship except Allah, the <br>One. There is no partner with Him; His is the king- <br>dom, and for Him is all praise, and He is All-pow- <br>erful to do everything, <br>he is rewarded as for freeing ten slaves, and in ad- <br>dition one hundred virtues are written to his ac- <br>count and one hundred sins are forgiven. He <br>remains protected against the devil throughout the <br>day, and none is considered as having acted better <br>than him except one who has recited these words <br>more often than him. Similarly, there are many <br>other ahaadith proclaming the superiority of zikr <br>over all other good deeds. <br>(34)Due to incessant zikr one is able not to forget one's <br>soul. Forgetting one's soul leads to failure in both <br>the worlds, because forgetting the remembrance of <br>Allah leads to neglecting one's soul and all its best <br>interests. Allah says in His book: <br>And be not ye as those who forgot Allah and there- <br>fore He caused them to forget their souls. Such are <br>the evil-doers. <br>Thus, when one forgets one's soul he becomes <br>I <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr \t<br>careless and forgets his re81 interests which leads <br>to his ruin just as a garden or field is invariably <br>ruined when its owner fails to look after it. Protec- <br>tion against this ruin can only be provided by <br>keeping one's tongue always busy in zikr, so that <br>zikr should become as indispensable as water is at <br>the extreme thirst, or food at the time of hunger, or <br>the house and clothes for protection against ex-<br>treme heat and cold. As a matter of fact, one <br>should be more mindful of zikr than any of these <br>material necessities, which at the most can result <br>in physical death, which is a small loss as com- <br>pared with the spiritual death. <br>(35)Zikr \t is the source of one's spiritual elevation <br>whether done in bed or in the market, whether in <br>% <br>good health or in sickness, or even when one is <br>8 5  <br>making most of the pleasures of life. Nothing but <br>g 3<br>zikr can take a man to such spiritual heights, <br>whereby his heart is so illuminated with the light <br>of zikr that even asleep he is more wakeful than <br>the neglectful person who is awake all through the <br>night. <br>(36)The noor (radiance) of zikr remains with a person <br>in his life as well as in his grave. It will go in front <br>of him on the Siraat. in the Hereafter. Almighty <br>Allah says in the Quran: <br>'<br>a<br>.<br>& b $ # G l & ? &  <br>Can he who was desd and whom We gave life, and <br>a light whereby he can walk among men, be like <br>him who is in utter darkness whence he cannot <br>emerge. <br>The one mentioned first is the faithful, who be- <br>lieves in Allah and shines with the light of His <br>love, zikr, and cognizance, while the second one is <br>devoid of all these virtues. In reality this radiance <br>is a great blessing and leads to perfect success. <br>That is why Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) used to beg for it in prolonged prayers, and <br>prayed for noor for every part of his body. As men-<br>tioned in many ahaadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>1 \t<br>alaihe wasallam) prayed that Almighty Allah may <br>bless his flesh, bones, muscles, hair, skin, eyes and <br>ears with noor, and that he may be surrounded <br>with noor on all sides; he even prayed that he may <br>be blessed with noor from top to bottom, and that <br>his whole person may be made into noor. One's <br>deeds will shine according to the noor in oneself, <br>so much so that the good deeds of some people <br>(while going upto heaven) will shine like the sun. <br>Similar noor will be found in their faces on the <br>Day of Judgement. <br>(37)Zikr is the basic principle of Tasawwuf (Sufism) <br>and is invoked in all the schools of Sufism. A <br>person who gets conversant with zikr enters the <br>gateway to Almighty Allah, and one who enters <br>this gateway is sure to reach Almighty Allah, from <br>Whom he will get whatever he wants, for Allah's <br>treasures are unlimited. <br>(38)There is not a corner in the heart of a man, which <br>can not be filled but with zikr. When zikr controls <br>the heart, not only does it fill up this corner, but <br>also does it lead the zaakir to contentment which <br>wealth would fail to produce and to respect among <br>people, which the family or party would fail to <br>bring about, and to such control over people as a <br>sovereign would never dream of. On the other <br>hand, the indolent comes to disgrace, in spite of <br>all his wealth and riches, party, strength and <br>powers. <br>(39)Zikr transform dispersion into concentration, and <br>concentration into dispersion; and remoteness into <br>nearness and nearness into remoteness. This <br>means that one is relieved of one's troubles, wor- <br>ries and fears, and is blessed with peace of mind. <br>I <br>His mistakes and sins are forgiven, and the devils <br>who are after him are dispersed away. It makes <br>him to remember that the Hereafter is not far <br>away, and the worldly life has little attraction for <br>hi^. <br>I <br>(40)Zikr does not allow one's heart to suffer from for- <br>getfulness, which leads to ignore one's ultimate in- <br>terest. <br><br>Ch. I: .Ahaadith on Zikr <br>(41)Zikr is just like a tree, the fruit of which is realiza- <br>tion of Almighty Allah. The more zikr is done, the <br>stronger shall grow the root of this tree; and <br>stronger the root of this tree, the more abundant <br>the fruit it will bear. <br>(42)Zikr of Almighty Allah promotes nearness to Him <br>and thereby earns His constant patronage. It is <br>given in the Quran <br>ljih j;$l <br>b 5! <br>No doubt Allah is with those who fear Him. <br>It is stated in one hadith <br>. - '<br>&w j& <br>J <br>(I <br>I am with my slave who remembers Me. \t<br>$$ <br>EN <br>According to another hadith, Allah says, \"Those <br>i' <br>who remember Me are My men, and I do not de- <br>prive them of My mercy. When they repent, I am <br>their friend, but when they do not repent. I am <br>their physician. I put them to worries to condone <br>their sins.\" Nearness to Almighty Allah resulting <br>from zikr has no parallel. No words and no writing <br>can describe this nearness. Its taste is known only <br>to those who are blessed with it. (May Almighty <br>Allah also bless me with the same). <br>(43)Zikr of \t Allah is as meritorious as liberating of <br>slaves, and spending in charity, and jihaad in the <br>path of Allah. <br>(Many virtues of this kind have already been de- <br>scribed and more will further be narrated in this <br>book). <br>(44)Zikr is the fundamental form of thanksgiving to <br>Almighty Allah. One who does not do zikr cannot <br>thank him. It is stated in hadith that Hadhrat <br>Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had asked Almighty Allah <br>\"0My Lord! You have done me countless favours, <br>teach me the manner in which I should thank you <br>befittingly.\" Almighty Allah said, \"The more zikr <br>you do, the more thanks you offer.\" According to <br>another hadith, Hadhrat Moosa (Alayhis salaam) is <br>reported to have said, \"0,Lord! how can I offer <br>Virtues of Zikr \t<br>thanks worthy of Your greatness.\" Almighty Allah <br>replied, \"Let your tongue always remain engaged <br>in zikr.\" <br>(45)According to Almighty Allah, the best of the pious <br>people are those who always remain busy in zikr, <br>because piety leads to paradise, and zikr to the <br>nearness to Allah: <br>(46)There is a sort of hardness in the human heart, <br>which is not softened by anything except zikr. <br>(47)In fact, zikr is a remedy for all ills of the heart. <br>(48)Zikr of Allah is the root of His love, and neglecting <br>zikr is the root of His enmity. -<br>(49)Nothing is more effective than zikr in attracting <br>Allah's blessings and in warding off His chastise- <br>ment. <br>(50)Almighty Allah grants His grace to those who do <br>zikr, and the angels pray for them. <br>(51)One who wants to remain in the gardens of Para- <br>dise, even in this life, should sit in the gatherings <br>of zikr, because these are likened to the gardens of <br>Paradise. <br>(52)Gatherings of zikr are also the gatherings of angels. <br>(53)In the presence of the angels, Almighty Allah <br>praises those who do zikr. <br>(54)One who 'is constant in doing zikr will enter Para- <br>dise in high spirits. <br>(55)All good deeds have been \t ordained because of <br>zikr.. <br>(56)A good deed becomes superior to others of its kind <br>because of zikr. Of the fasts, the one with more <br>I <br>zikr is the best; Of the Hajj, one with excessive <br>zikr is more virtuous. Similar is the case with <br>other good deeds like jihaad etc; <br>(57)Zikr is a substitute of nafl salaat and other non- <br>obligatory devotions. It is related in one hadith <br>that the poor people once complained to Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho a!aihe wasallam) of the higher <br>reward available to the rich because of their <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>wealth. They said, \"These rich men offer prayers <br>and fast, just as we do, but they excel us by per- <br>forming Umrah and Hajj, and taking part in jihaad <br>on account of their wealth.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Should I tell you some- <br>thing, so that none except one who practices it can <br>excel you.\" He then advised them to recite after <br>every salaat: <br>By this Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>had indicated the importance of zikr, to be the <br>substitute for various kinds of worship, like <br>Umrah, Hajj, jihaad, etc. <br>o<br>(r aa<br>(58)Zikr is very helpful to all other forms of worship. <br>g R<br>Excessive zikr creates love for various forms of <br>worship, so that one starts taking delight in their <br>performance and never feels bored or burdened <br>while offering them. <br>(59)Zikr is a solution to all difficulties, and remedy for <br>all handicaps. It lightens every burden, and re-<br>lieves every affliction. <br>(60)Zikr dispels every fear of the heart. It has a special <br>hand in inducing peace of mind and for relieving <br>the heart of its fear. To free the heart of its fears <br>and mind of its perplexity is one of the specific <br>qualities of zikr. The greater, therefore, the amount <br>of zikr, the greater freedom from fear. <br>(61)By zikr one is blessed with divine help that asso- <br>ciates in all one's doings. That is why some time <br>man's achievements surpass his powers, and he <br>attains what was seemingly beyond his reach. <br>This is perhaps the reason why Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) advised his daughter <br>Hadhrat Fatimah, (Radhiyallaho anha) to recite <br>B i;;ji a, ;G thirty three times each and ;;i&thirty <br>, . <br>four times before going to bed at night, when she <br>approached him for a helper, complaining that she <br>was over-worked by the labour of grinding wheat <br>and doing other house-hold jobs. 'The Prophet <br>80 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) further said, \"The <br>recitation of these kalimahs is better for you than a <br>servant.\" <br>(62)Those who are working for the life Hereafter are in <br>a race, wherein the zaakirs shall remain ahead of <br>all on account of their zikr. On the day of Judge- <br>ment, says Umar Maula Ghufra (Rahmatullah <br>alaih), when people will be rewarded for their <br>good deeds, many shall repent why they neglected <br>zikr when it was easiest of all good deeds and the <br>highest in reward. In a hadith, Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) is quoted to have said, \"The <br>mufarrideen have surpassed all.\" He was asked, <br>\"Who were the mufarrideen?\" The Prophet (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Those who toil <br>hard for zikr because it lightens their burdens.\" <br>(63)Those who do zikr are held truthful by Almighty <br>Allah, and those who are testified as such by <br>Almighty Allah cannot be raised among the liars <br>on the Day of Judgement. It is quoted on the auth- <br>ority of Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that <br>when a man utters, <br>Allah proclaims, \"My slave has spoken the truth, <br>and nobody is worthy of worship except I, and I <br>am the Greatest of all.\" <br>(64)Zikr causes houses to be built in Paradise by the <br>angels. When zikr is stopped, the angels also stop <br>construction of houses. When asked why a par-<br>ticular construction was stopped by the angels, <br>they reply, \"The construction had to be stopped <br>because funds for that were stopped. The fact is <br>I <br>confirmed by a hadith, which says when a man re- <br>cites 41b G  4 k j  <br>d% <br>seven times, a tower <br>is raised for him in paradise. <br>(65)Zikr provides protection against Hell. If, due to <br>any misdeed a zaakir deserves Hell, his zikr acts as <br>a defence between him and the Hell, the more his <br>zikr, the stronger will be this defence. <br>(66)The~ngelspray for the forgiveness of those who do <br><br>Ch. I: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>zikr. It is related on the authority of Hadhrat Amr <br>bin Aas (Radhiyallaho anho) that when a man says <br>j <br>1 9% <br>9.1 <br>the angels pray to <br>4; A-l;iji <br>Almighty Allah for his forgiveness. <br>(67)The mountain or plain on which zikr is recited <br>feels proud of it. According to a hadith, one moun- <br>tain asks another if any zaakir has crossed over it <br>during the day. If the.reply is in the affirmative. it <br>feels happy. <br>(68)Zikr guarantees immunity from hypocrisy, for <br>Almighty Allah has described the hypocrite as <br>% YI i l  b;;ij; <br>y They do not remember Allah except <br>very rarely. It is also related on the authority of <br>Ka'b Ahbaar (Radhiyallaho anho) that he who <br>makes frequent zikr of Allah is free from hypoc- <br>risy. <br>e l  <br>(69)Compared with other good deeds, zikr carries a <br>special taste, which is not to be found in any other <br>action. Even if there were no other virtue to zikr, <br>this fine taste alone would have been a sufficient <br>reward to justify it. Maalik bin Deenaar (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) has said that nothing surpasses the taste <br>of zikr, which is the best and finest. <br>(70)The faces of those who do zikr remain bright in <br>this life, and will carry a special radiance in the <br>Hereafter. <br>(71)One who is frequently engaged in zikr, whether he <br>is in or out of his house, whether he is stationary <br>or travelling, he will find, on the Day of Judge- <br>ment, a large number of witnesses in his favour. <br>Almighty Allah has described the Day of Judgment <br>as 6jVI LLJ +3 The day when the Earth will tell <br>all that it knows. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked his <br>companions if they knew what those news would <br>be. They expressed their ignorance. Then Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whatever <br>deed is done, good or bad, by any man or woman <br>on the face of the Earth, the Earth will describe it <br>all, with d a t ~ ,  time and place.\" Hence, one who <br>does zikr at many places will find many witnesses <br>in his favour. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I <br>(72)As long as the tongue is busy in zikr, it cannot in- <br>dulge in lies, backbiting or any other kind of evil <br>talk. The tongue will engage itself in useless talk if <br>it is not in zikr, because it-cannot remain quiet. So <br>is the case with the heart; if it is devoid of love for <br>Almighty Allah, it will be filled with the love of <br>I <br>worldly things. <br>(73)The devils are outright enemies of man and always <br>create trouble for him and keep him surrounded. <br>I <br>The miserable condition of one who remains sur- <br>rounded by enemies can well be imagined, espec- <br>ially when the enemies are vindictive and <br>everyone of them wants to surpass the other in <br>troubling him. Nothing except zikr can protect <br>him against these enemies. Many forms of du'aa <br>are mentioned in the ahaadith, so that, if any of <br>these is recited by a person, then Satan dare not <br>come near him. If the same is recited at the time of <br>going to bed, one remains safe from the Satan <br>throughout the night. Hafiz Ibn Qayyim (Rahma- <br>tullah alaih) has also mentioned many such <br>du'aas. <br>In addition to these, the author has also mentioned in <br>detail under six headings the relative merits of zikr as also <br>some of its virtues, which are specific to zikr alone. Then <br>he has also given seventy five chapters on special du'aas, <br>which are suited to specific times and occasions. For the <br>sake of brevity, these have been excluded from this book. <br>For those blessed with determination to act, the virtues of <br>zikr detailed above are more than enough, and for those <br>who are disinclined to act, thousands of such virtues <br>would be of little avail. <br>sig,&; & <br>$! 3 3<br>.-. b, <br>I<br>< -<br>Whatever good I have done is through the grace of <br>i <br>Almighty Allah; I, therefore, depend on Him and turn <br>to Him. <br><br>CHAPTER I1 <br>KALIMAH TAYYIBAH <br>Kalimah Tayyibah, which is also called Kalimah Tau- <br>heed (utterance of Unity), has been mentioned in the <br>Qur'an and the hadith far more frequently than anything <br>else. Since all the saints and Prophets had been sent speci- <br>fically with the primary aim of propagating the Unity of <br>Allah, its excessive mention can well be understood. In the <br>Holy Qur'an, this kalimah has been referred to by various <br>names and in different contexts. It has been referred to as <br>Kalimah Tayyibah (excellent utterance), cat J3)(firm state- <br>%<br>V) L.<br>ment) (cs# iJS) (utterance of piety), (/jJlj al&l <br>(key of <br>heaven and earth), etc: as will be found in the Qur'anic <br>E N  <br>verses given in the following pages. Imaam Ghazaali (Rah- <br>matullah alaih) has written in his book Ihyaa that it is <br>(+PILIo (utterance of Unity) W * ~ U )  (utterance of sincer- <br>ity) (&#dlLK) (utterance of piety) (aU)(excellent utter- <br>ance) ( j r 3 1 a ~ j )(strong rope) (&I Yj) (call of truth) (SlJ;) <br>(price of paradise). <br>As this kalimah has been mentioned in various con- <br>texts in the Holy Qur'an, this chapter is divided into three <br>parts. The first part includes those verses wherein the <br>words of Kalimah Tayyibah do not occur, although it is im- <br>plied therein. Each verse is followed by a brief explanation, <br>as given by the Sahabah and by Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) himself. <br>The second part consists of t h o s ~  <br>verses which contain tlie <br>text of Kalimah Tayyibah i.e. ~ I Y !  in full-, or slightly<br>J!Y <br>modified, such as j i y ~i ~ j .  <br>the kalimah <br>As the words of <br>occur in these verses, their translation has not been consid- <br>ered necessary. Only the surah and ruku, in which the avat <br>occurs, has been indicated. The third part includes the <br>translation and explanation of those ahaadith that describe <br>the virtues and importance of this kalimah <br>(Whatever has been done is merely through Allah's grace). <br><br>I<br>Virtues of Zikr <br>PARTI \t<br>I <br>I <br>This contains those ayaat in which the words of the <br>Kalimah Tayyibah do not occur, although it is implied <br>therein: <br>(I) \t Seest thou not how Allah explains through a parable. <br>Good words are like a good tree that is firmly rooted <br>and its branches reach the sky. It brings fruit at all <br>times, under order from its Lord. So Allah explains <br>through parables for men that they may take heed. The <br>parable of evil words is like an evil tree. It is torn up <br>by the root from the surface of the Earth. It has no sta- <br>bility. <br>Note: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) has explained <br>that the words \"Kalimah Tayyibah\" in this ayat mean the <br>Kalimah Shahaadat <br>which is like a tree with its roots in the hearts of the faith- <br>ful and its branches spread out up to Heaven, by means <br>of which the deeds of the faithful climb up to Heaven; and <br>w w  (ugly utterance) is the utterance of Shirk, which <br>prevents any good deed from being accepted. In another <br>hadith, it is stated by Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>\"bearing of fruit all the time\" means that almighty Allah be <br>remembered day and night. <br>It was narrated by Hadhrat Qataadah (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) that somebody had said to Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam), \"The rich are able to earn great rewards <br>(by virtue of spending their wealth in charity)\". Rasulullah <br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Tell me if anybody <br>can reach the sky by piling up his goods one over the other. <br>I tell you of something, which has its roots in the Earth and <br>its branches spread out into the Heaven. It is recitation of <br>the kalimah <br>ten times each after every salaat. <br>(2) \t Whosoever desires glory and power (should know) that <br>L. <br>glory and all powers belong to Allah; Unto Him good <br>sg<br>words ascend and He exalts all righteous deeds. <br>tfN<br>-<br>According to the majority of :o~mentators, the Kali- <br>S <br>mah Tayyibah in this ayat means (&Iys ir!9), but some are of <br>the opinion that it implies the kalimah of tasbeeh. as will <br>be described in part 11. <br>(3) \t The word of thy Lord finds its fulfilment in truth and <br>in justice. <br>According to Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho), Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said that the kali- <br>mah of the Lord means the kalimah klj!ii!9. Bu: many <br>con~mentators are of the opinion that it means the Holy <br>Qur'an. <br>(4) \t Allah will confirm those who believe in words that <br>stand firm, in this world and in the Hereafter, and <br>Allah sends wrong doers astray. Allah does what He <br>wills. <br>Hadhrat Baraa (Radhiyallaho anho) stated that Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"At the time of <br>interrogation in the grave, a Muslim bears witness to <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>and this is meant by the words (firm statement) in this ayat. <br>Hadhrat Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) also corroborated <br>that it refers to the interrogation in the grave. Hadhrat Ibn <br>Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said, \"When a Muslim is about <br>to die, the angels come to him, greet him, and convey the <br>glad tidings of paradise; after his death, they accompany <br>him and join his funeral prayer; and after he is buried, they <br>make him sit up when, in the grave, questioning starts. He <br>replies <br>'I bear witness that there is nobody worthy of worship <br>except Allah. and I bear witness that Muhammad is the <br>messenger of Allah.' <br>'I'his is what is implied in this ayat.\" <br>Hadhrat Abu Qataadah. (Radhiyallaho anho) also said <br>that c+ujh <br>(firm statement) refers to the Kalimah <br>'I'avyibah in this life. and the interrogation in the grave <br>after dcath. Hadhrat Taa'oos (Kahmatullah alaih) also gave <br>the same interpretation. <br>(5) \t Unto Him is the real praver. Those unto whom they <br>prav besides Allah responds to them not at all. Thev <br>are like those who stretch forth their hands for water to <br>reach their mouths but it reaches them not. The praver <br>of clisbelie\\lers goes astray. <br>Note: According to 1-jadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) as <br>well as Ibn Abbas (Radhi!lallaho anho) and Inanv others, <br>the words ;$I +(propagation of truth) means this kalimah. <br>I <br>I <br>I <br>L<br>f <br>I <br>I <br>1 <br><br>L <br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>8 7 <br>(6) \t Say: 0,people of scriptures!

The same view-point has been categorically con- <br>firmed by Hadhrat Abu Aaliyah and Hadhrat Mujahid <br>(Rahmatullah alaitiima). <br>> <br>(7) \t You are the best of people, evolved for mankind, en- <br>joining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and be- <br>lieving in Allah.

Lo! good deeds annul i l l  <br>deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. <br>The \texpla~lation of this sacred avat is to be found in <br>maliy ahaatlith ac:cording to whic:h Kasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasnll;lnl) while refering to this ayat had said that <br>good cieeds wipe out the sins from one's acc:ount. l-iadhrat <br>Abu Zar (Katlhi!lallaho rt~iho) says that he had once re-<br>quested Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give <br>him some advice and Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>lam) replied, \"Hold Almighty Allah in constant fear. If per- <br>chalice you commit anv sin. hasten at once to do some vir- <br>tuous deed so that the sin is atoned, and it is written off.\" <br>'Then Abu Zar (Radhiyallaho anho) continues to say that he <br>asked Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if this kali- <br>mah <br>I <br>was also counted amongst the virtues. <br>At this, Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) gave the <br>replv that this kalimah is the highest of all virtues. It is <br>likewise quoted from Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said <br>\"Whosover, any time during the day or night, recites the <br>kalimah <br>I <br>! <br>. his sins are washed off his ac-<br>count.\" <br>(9) \t (a) Lo! Allah enjoineth justice and kindness and <br>giving to kinsfolk. He forbids shameful deeds, in- <br>justice and rebellion. He instructs you in order <br>that you take heed. <br>There are different versions regarding the interpreta- <br>tion of the word <br>2-i; <br>(justice). In one version, Hadh- <br>rat Abdullah bin Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that <br>?L <br>(justice) means to believe that nobody is worthy of worship <br>except Allah, while <br>J <br>(goodness) means to do <br>one's obligations to Allah. <br>(10)0,you who believe! Fear Allah and say words straight <br>to the point, that He may make your conduct sound <br>and forgive your sins. Whosoever obeys Allah and His <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), he has attained <br>the highest achievement. <br>Hadhrat Abdullah bin Abbas and Hadhrat Ikramah <br>(Radhiyallaho anhuma) are both said to have been of the <br>view that the meaning of <br>L Y <br>I <br>, <br>(and speak words <br>straight to the right) is to recite the <br>I <br>kalimah. <br>According to one hadith, three things constitute the best of <br><br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>all actions. The first is to do zikr of Allah under all circum- <br>stances, in happiness and in grief, in poverty and in afflu- <br>ence; the second is to conduct oneself with impartiality <br>even when one's own interests are involved; and the third <br>is to help one's brother with money. <br>(11)Give good tidings to my servants, who hear advice and <br>follow the best thereof. Such are those whom Allah <br>guideth, and such are men of understanding. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said that Hadh- <br>rat Sa'eed bin Zaid, Hadhrat Abu Zar Ghifaari and Hadhrat <br>'b<br>Salmaan Faarsi (Radhiyallaho anho), all the three, used to <br>~l 2 <br>L <br>recite the kalimah <br>I <br>even before they em-<br>5EN <br>braced Islaam, and by the words <br>I <br>I <br>(the best ut- <br>terance) what is exactly meant in thls sacred ayat is this <br>kalimah. Hadhrat Zaid bin Aslam (Radhiyallaho anho) had <br>also said that this ayat relftes to three persons who used to <br>recite the kalimah <br>I <br>Y A <br>even in their days of ig- <br>norance, and they were Hadhrat Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail, <br>Hadhrat Abu Zar Ghifaari and Hadhrat Salmaan Faarsi <br>(Radhiyallaho anhum). <br>(12)He who brings the true thing and He who confirms it; <br>such are the dutiful. They shall have all they wish <br>from their Lord's bounty. Such is the reward of those <br>who do good. <br>The persons who brought the message from Almighty <br>Allah are the Prophets (Alaihimus salaatu was salaam) and <br>the people who brought a message from Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) are the Ulama (May Allah accept <br>their efforts). Hadhrat lbn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) is <br>stated \\o Fave said that \"the true thing'' means the kali- <br>mah <br>AIY!a19 <br>. According to some commentators, the <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>words Z L ' l i  ;& 2-i\" (one who brought the true message <br>froni Allah) refers to Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) and the words <br>(those who confirmed it) <br>refer to the believers. <br>(13)In the case of those who say, \"Our Lord is Allah\", and <br>afterwards are steadfast, the angels descend upon them <br>saying, \"Fear not, nor grieve but hear good tidings of <br>the Paradise which you were promised. We are your <br>protecting friends in the life of the world and in the <br>Hereafter. There you will have all that your souls <br>desire, and then vou will have what you pray for. A <br>gift of welcome from the forgiving the Merciful.\" <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) said that the <br>words cli;Gl2ti, (then remained steadfast) means that they <br>remained steadfast in their belief in the kalimah +t$!d!5!)<br>Hadhrat Ibrahim and Hadhrat Mujahid (Rahmatullah alai- <br>hima) both supported the interpretation \"they stuck to the <br>kalimah (i~u'!ii!J) upto their death, and never indulged in <br>Shirk of any kind\" <br>(14)Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to <br>Allah and doeth righteous deeds and says, \"I am <br>among those who bow in Islaam (the Muslims).\" <br>Hadhrat - Hasan (Radhiyallaho anho) said that the <br>words (flllJ!W (invited towards Allah) refers'to the call- <br>ing of <br>&IY!~~!Y, <br>by the muazzin. Aasim bin Hubairah <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) advised, \"After finishing azaan, one <br>should recite <br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah: Allah is the <br>greatest and I am from among the Muslims. <br>(15)Is the reward of goodness ought save goodness? Which <br>is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated that <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"The <br>meaning of this ayat is that Allah says, 'Can there be any <br>other reward than Paradise in the Hereafter for one whom I <br>blessed in his worldly life with the recitation of kalimah <br>( i t  j!A$) .\" Hadhrat Ikramah and Hadhrat Hasan (Ra-<br>dhiyallaho anhuma) have also said that the reward of <br>y'! &J)cannot be anything but Paradise. <br>I B  <br>(16)Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Mes- <br>senger and upon the believers and imposed upon them <br>the word of self restraint, for they were entitled to it <br>and worthv of it. <br>(*u)(utterance of piety) in this hadith means kalimah <br>Tayvibah as explained in many narrations. Hadhrat Abu <br>Hurairah and Hadhrat Salama (Radhiyallaho anhuma) <br>quoted Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as having <br>said that it means &J!A!J) . The same view was expressed <br>bv Hadhrat Ubavv bin Kab. Hadhrat Ali, Hadhrat Umar. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas. Hadhrat Ibn Umar, and many other <br>Sahabas. (Radhivallaho anhum). Ataa Khurasani (Rahma- <br>tullahi alaihi) was of the view that it meant the whole Kali- <br>nlah Tayyibah i.e. <br>i <br>l <br>j <br>~ <br>~ <br>~ <br>i <br>~ Hadhrat<br>~ <br>l <br>~ Ali ~<br>while <br>! <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) .had said that it meant $i kih $ 4 ~  <br>Tirnlizi is stated to have quoted on the authority of Baraa <br>(Rddhivaliaho anho) that this implied: t$A!J <br>. <br>(&', 2 3  3 <br>1(CV)@<br>(17)Those who purify themselves wili prosper. <br>Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) has quoted Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to have said that 21 <br>Virtues of Zikr \t<br>37 i<br>(purified) means he declared his faith i n h  j>;s<br>311 u'! i!Y and <br>gave up idol-worship. According to Hadhrat k a y h (Ra-<br>dhiyallaho anho) 2 3  means he proclaimed b 4!d!J <br>and <br>this also was the viewpoint held by Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) <br>(18)As for him who giveth and is dutiful (towards Allah) <br>and believeth in goodness. Surely we will ease his way <br>unto the state of ease. <br>(JA)(state of ease) means Paradise, because it is <br>Paradise where all kinds of comforts and facilities will be <br>available. Its further elaboration is that Allah will so grace <br>a man as to make good deedseasy for him, which will ex- <br>pedite his entry to Paradise. Many commentators are of the <br>view that the above-mentioned ayat was revealed in favour <br>of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). <br>According to Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>the word (&I) <br>(good thing) mentioned in this ayat means <br>the kalimah 31j!d!Y) . Hadhrat Abu Abdur Rahmaan Salmi <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) also shares this view. Hadhrat <br>Imaam-e-A'zam (Rahmatullah alaih) quoting on the auth- <br>ority of Abu Zubair and Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho <br>anhuma) says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>explained that (>4 <br>JL)means 'testified 31j~ii!j ', while <br>$.Ac +k means 'refi;teds. <br>(19)He who does a good deed shall have ten times as much <br>to his credit. He who does an evil deed will be <br>awarded according to his evil. No wrong shall be done <br>to them. <br>' ,-,.. <br>It is related when this ayat *kbk <br>3 descended, <br>someone asked Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) if <br>the reciting of (bg! A!$ <br>was also counted among their vir- <br>tuous deeds. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) re- <br>plied that it is the best of all virtues. Hadhrat Abdullah bin <br>Abbaas and Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho <br>anhum) take (b)<br>(virtue) to mean <br>j\\ill% . Hadhrat Abu <br>Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) also holds exactly the same <br>view. Similar meanings were also narrated by Hadhrat Abu <br><br>Ch. 11: Ayaat Implying Kalimah Tayyibah <br>i <br>Zar Ghifaari (Radhiyallaho anho) on the authority of Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) who held that @j!i!y)<br>was the best amongst all virtuous deeds. <br>According to Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). one good deed is counted ten times over as a general <br>principle but, for the muhaajirs, compensation for one good <br>deed is raised to seven hundred times. <br>(20)The revelation of this.

The same interpretation is also related <br>from Sufyaan (Rahmatullah alaih). <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>CONCLUSION: <br>I <br><br>PART 2 <br>This chapter includes such ayaat as contains the Kali- <br>mah Tayyibah in full or in part, or else its equivalent in dif- <br>ferent words but having the same meaning. The Kalimah <br>Tayyibah (&l$d!J) means that nobody is worthy of wor- <br>ship except Allah. The words <br>(;;;i+>r;, <br>and jcj!d!J and <br>(31 J! W)also cany the same meaning. Similarly(i$d! l;irJ) (We <br>do not worship anybody other than Allah) and <br>d! 3 @)<br>(He is the only one worthy of worship) also mean the same <br>thing. There are other similar ayaat, which imply the same <br>meaning as of Kalimah Tayyibah. The surah and ruku in <br>cl<br>which each such ayat occurs has been indicated below. In <br>fact, the whole of the Holy Qur'an is an explanation of the <br>8 &<br>ZN<br>Kalimah Tayyibah, because the basic objective of the Holy <br>Qur'an and of the deen of Islam is towheed. It is to propa- <br>gate towheed that the messengers of Allah were sent to <br>people at different times. Towheed is the common objec- <br>tive of all'the revealed religions, and for this reason the <br>subject of towheed has all along been dealt with under dif- <br>ferent headings to establish its truth. The same towheed is <br>therefore the object of Kalimah Tayyibah. <br>1. \t Your Allah is one Allah.

Say: He is Allah, The One and Only. <br>(Ikhlaas) <br>The above are the eighty five verses, in which text of <br>Kalimah Tayyibah or its equivalent in meaning has oc-<br>curred. There are still many more verses, which equally <br>convey the same sense and meaning of the Kalimah as I <br>have stated in the beginning of this section. Tauheed is the <br>fundamental basis of Deen, and therefore the more ac-<br>quainted a man is with the requirements of Tauheed, the <br>more steadfast he shall be in Deen. Tauheed in the Holy <br>Qur'an has been described from various viewpoints and in <br>various manners and aspects, so that it may penetrate <br>through the very depths of the heart; so it firmly settles <br>there, leaving no room for anything else to enter. <br>I 3<br>~ <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalirnah Tayyabah 107 <br>PART 3 <br>Part 3 includes such ahadith which describe the vir- <br>tues and blessings of reciting Kalimah Tayyibah. In the <br>foregoing we have seen that there is plurality of ayaat on <br>this subject, which goes to prove that the number of aha- <br>dith on this subject must be far more numerous. It is there- <br>fore difficult to record them all here. Only a few illustrative <br>examples will be given here. <br>HadithNo 1 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"of <br>all the azkaar (plural of zikr) the repetition of (&IJ!~IY, <br>is the best, and of all the du'aas (Am'i,is the best.\" <br>- .  <br>That & j ! i ! ~ )is the best of all azkaar is quite evident. It <br>is described as such in many ahadith. In fact when the <br>whole of Deen depends on this Kalimah Tauheed, there <br>can hardly be any doubt that it is the highest of all azkaar. <br>Again (+.a\\)<br>(Alhamdolillah) has been regarded as the best <br>du'aa, because praising one who is the most benevolent <br>person is in fact a form of begging. It is common experience <br>that by writing a eulogy in praise of a man of wealth or of <br>authority does not mean anything else than begging his <br>favours or riches. <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiyallaho anho) says that one <br>who recites ( a . u I )  should follow it by hlj!i!y, because in <br>the Holy Qur'an the verse <br>(Ask Allah with sincere devotion) <br>is followed by 91<br>;j i<br>. . Ui (All praise is for Allah Who is <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>the Cherisher of all the universe). <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated: \"There <br>is not the slightest doubt that Kalimah Tayyibah is by far <br>the best and foremost of all azkaar because it is the root and <br>fundamental basis of the Deen and the whole religion of <br>1slam.centres round it. It is for this reason that the Sufis <br>and saints emphasise its importance and prefer it over all <br>other azkaar and advise their followers to practise it as <br>much as possible. Also, actual experience has shown that, <br>the benefits following from Kalimah Tayyibah far out-<br>number those which result from other forms of zikr. <br>There is a well-known story of Sayyid Ali bin May- <br>moon Maghrabi. Once Shaikh Ulwan Hamawi, who himself <br>was a great scholar, Mufti and teacher of his age, came for <br>learning zikr. The Sayyid (Kahmatullah alaih) devoted <br>special attention to him and made hinl give up all his rou- <br>tines, such as teaching and writing fatawa, and to take up <br>zikr all the time. On this, the common people started freely <br>indulging in fault finding and condemnation. They started <br>a campaign of criticism that the Shaikh has now been lost <br>to them and the people were being deprived of his benefits. <br>A few days later, when the Sayyid (Rahmatullah alaih) <br>came to know that Shaikh Ulwan was occasionally reciting <br>the Holy Qur'an, he stopped him from this recitation also. <br>At this, the people lost all sense and openly accused the <br>Sayyid, (Rahmatullah alaih), of irreligiousness and perver- <br>sion. After some time, when the Shaikh observed that the <br>zikr has had its effect on his heart, the Sayyid (Rahmatul- <br>lah alaih) allowed him to resume recitation of the Holy <br>Qur'an. When he opened the Book, every word and aavat <br>emerged with new meanings and significance he never <br>thought of before. The Sayyid (Rahmatullah alaih) then <br>told Shaikli lqamawi that he had not forbidden him from <br>recitation, but in fact he had desired to develop in him <br>spiritual awareness, which was a pre-requisite for this reci- <br>tation of the Qur'an. <br>As this Holy Kalimah constitutes the fundamental <br>basis of religion and the root of Imaan (faith), the greater <br>the devotion to this Kalimah. the more firmly will Imaan be <br>rooted. lmaan depends on this Kalimah, and the very exist- <br>ence of this world depends on it. According to a hadith, the <br>Day of Judgment will not dawn as long as there exists on <br>Earth a single man reciting the Kalimah b Y\\ dry. This is re- <br>ported in other ahadith also. So long as there lives a single <br>I <br><br>Ch. II: Ahadith on.Virtues of Kalimah I'ayyabah <br>man on Earth who remembers Almighty Allah, Qiyaamat <br>(Doomsday) will not take place. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to <br>have said: \"Once the prophet Moosa (Alayhis salaam) <br>prayed to Almighty Allah to teach him some forms of <br>zikr for his remembrance. He was advised to recite (bj!i!J,. <br>He submitted: '0 my Lord! this zikr is recited by all <br>the creation. Again came the reply: \"Recite 31i!&Y .\" <br>He submitted: '0 my Sustainer, I want something <br>special, exclusively meant for me.\" Then Almighty <br>Allah said: 'If the seven heavens and the seven earths <br>were placed in one pan of the Balance, and the Kali- <br>mah <br>i!d!4 in the other, the latter will outweigh the <br>former.\" <br>It is the usual way of Almighty Allah that what is re- <br>quired most is provided most. The more pressing the need <br>for a thing, the more plentiful is the provision for the same. <br>> <br>Looking at the most essential necessities of life, such as <br>breathing. water and air, it will be observed that Almighty <br>Allah has created them in great abundance. It is, however. <br>Ikhlaas (purity of intention) that determines the value of <br>things in the eye of Almighty Allah. The greater the Ikhlaas <br>in an action the greater will be its weight and, likewise. <br>less the Ikhlaas and devotion, the lesser the weight. For the <br>attainment of this Ikhlaas, nothing is more effective than <br>this Kalimah. That is why it is also known as purifier of <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>hearts (<br>1 s*) <br>. For its purifying effect, Sufis prescribe zikr <br>of this Kalimah and advise its recitation as a daily routine, <br>not only in hundreds but in thousands of times. Mulla Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that a disciple once com- <br>plained to his Shaikh that, despite doing zikr, his heart re- <br>mained inattentive. The Shaikh replied: \"Go on with your <br>zikr firmly, and thank Almighty Allah for His Grace that He <br>enabled a part of your body. i.e. the tongue, to remain busy <br>in His zikr, and pray to Allah for a devoted heart.\" A simi- <br>lar incident is related in Ihyaa-ul Uloom about Abu Usman <br>I<br>Maghribi, who gave the same reply on a similar con~plaint <br>made by one of his disciples, and he prescribed the same <br>cure. As a matter of fact, zikr is the best remedy for indo- <br>lence of the heart. Almighty Allah says in His Book, \"If you <br>show gratitude to Me, I will grant even more than before.\" <br>Likewise the hadith says \"zikr of Almighty Allah is a great <br>blessing; and be thankful to Him in as much as He has en- <br>abled you to do His zikr.\" <br>Hadith No 3 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) once en- <br>quired from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as <br>to who would be most benefitted by his intercession <br>on the Day, of Resurrection. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied, \"Knowing your anxiety for <br>the Urn (knowledge) of ahadith, I could expect that <br>I <br>none other than you would have asked this question <br>earlier.\" Thereafter the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) told Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) that <br>the most blessed or the most benefitted by my interces- <br>sion will be the person who proclaims (31y'!j!y, with <br>Ikhlaas (sincerity). <br>The meaning of good fortune here is to get something <br>good through the Grace of Allah. That the person reciting <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 111 <br>the Kalimah with Ikhlaas Miil be most deserving to be ben- <br>efitted by the intercession of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, such a <br>person could be one who has just embraced Islaam with <br>sincerity of heart, and has done no other good deed except <br>the recitation of the Kalimah. Evidently he can be helped <br>only by virtue of this intercession, because he has no deed <br>to his credit. In this case, this hadith is corroborated by <br>other ahadith, in which it is stated that the intercession <br>will be for those guilty of major sins who shall have been <br>sent to the Hell because of their sins, but by virtue of their <br>recitation of the Kalimah Tayyibah they will be released <br>through the intercession of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). Secondly, the most deserving people to be ben- <br>efitted will be those who continually recite this Kalimah <br>with sincerity and they have to their credit other good <br>'8 <br>deeds as well. Being most fortunate means that they will be <br>8 & <br>benefitted more than by anything else by the intercession <br>%z <br>of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in raising their <br>a <br>status in Paradise. <br>Allama Ainee (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), will intercede in six <br>different ways on the Day of Judgement, Firstly, it will be <br>for relief from the intolerable distress and supense in the <br>field of judgement, where all the people will be afflicted in <br>various ways and will even prefer to be sent to Hell so that <br>their present worries may come to an end. They will go to <br>all the high-ranking Prophets, one by one, and beg them to <br>intercede before Almighty Allah, but none of them will <br>dare to do so. At last, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) will intercede, and this intercession will be in favour <br>of all the people, including Jinn and mankind, believers <br>and non-beliyers, all of whom will be benefitted by it, as <br>explained in detail in the ahadith describing the Resurrec- <br>tion. Secondly, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>will intercede for mitigation of punishment to some non- <br>believers, as mentioned in the hadith about Abu Talib. <br>Thirdly, his intercession will be for the release from Hell of <br>some of the Believers who have been thrown in there. <br>Fourthly, it will be for the pardon from Hell of some Be- <br>lievers, who on account of their misdeed have deserved to <br>be condemned to it. Fifthly, it will be in favour of some Be- <br>lievers for their admittance into Paradise, without requiring <br>them to render account of their deeds. Sixthly, it will be for <br>raising the status of the Believers in general. <br>Virtues of Z'ikr <br>HadithRo 4 <br>Hadhrat Zaid bin Arqam (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>I <br>I<br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho -alaihe wasallam) had said <br>that one who recites (31j!d!9) with Ikhlaas will enter <br>Paradise. Somebody asked what was the sign of Ikh- <br>laas. He explained that it prevents one from indulging <br>in the forbidden things. <br>It is apparent that one w h ~ ,  <br>abs,tains from the forbidden <br>things and professes faith in 41g! 93 , will directly be ad- <br>mitted into the Paradise. But if one has indulged in some <br>forbidden things and has been sent to Hell, even then <br>through the blessing of this Kalimah he will, certainly <br>someday, after undergoing punishment for his misdeeds, <br>be transferred to Paradise. But if his misdeeds have led him <br>to stray out of the fold of Islaam and Imaan, he will <br>remain condemned in the Hell for ever. <br>Faqih' Abul Laith of Samarkand has written in his <br>book Tanbeeh-ul-Ghaafileen, \"It is imperative for every- <br>body to hymn (31J ! ~ ! J )often, and also pray to Almighty <br>Allah for steadfastness in Imaan, and abstain from sins; be- <br>cause there are many people whose sinful deeds destroy <br>their Imaan and they die as non-believers. There can be no <br>tragedy greater than that a man should be listed as a <br>Muslim throughout his life, but on the Day of Resurrection <br>his name should appear in the list of non-believers. This is <br>indeed the greatest misfortune. One does not feel sorry for <br>a person who has throughout worshipped in a church or a <br>temple and in the Hereafter is listed among the non-believ- <br>ers, but it is a matter of great grief that he who had re-<br>mained in the musjid should be counted as one of the non- <br>believers. This happens, as a result of excessive sinning <br>and secret indulgence in forbidden things. For instance, a <br>person gets unlawful possession of something knowingly, <br>but he consoles his conscience that he will restore it some <br>day to its real owner, or will get it condoned by him, but he <br>happens to die before he is able to do anything of the sort. <br>There are some who divorce their wives, but even then, <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>knowingly, they continue to cohabit with them, till death <br>overtakes them. In such cases, one does not get a chance of <br>doing Taubah (repentance) and consequently is completely <br>deprived of his Imaan. May Almighty Allah save us from <br>this! <br>L,,.&& $\\ <br>In the books of Hadith, the story of a young man who <br>was unable to recite the Kalimah, when his end was near, <br>is related. It was brought to the notice of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam), who went to the young man and <br>asked him what was the matter with him. He replied that <br>he felt as if his mind was locked. On enquiry, it transpired <br>that his mother was angry with him because of his mis- <br>behaviour. She was called by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and when she came, he said to her: \"If some-<br>ZG<br>body kindles a big fire and wants to throw your son into it, <br>will you recommend mercy for him?\" \"I will certainly do <br>so\", she replied. \"If it is so, then forgive his sin\", said Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). At this she pardoned <br>her son, and thereafter when the young man was asked to <br>recite the Kalimah he readily did so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) thanked Almighty Allah that, through his <br>effort, the man was saved from the fire of Hell. There are <br>hundreds of cases, like the one mentioned above, where <br>the evil effect of the sins in which we get involved results <br>in our worldly as well as spiritual loss. <br>The worthy author of Ihya-ul-Uloom has related that <br>once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) ge1,ivered a <br>sermon, in which he said: \"One who recites (dl Y! d!J, , in <br>the manner that he does not mix it up,rhe becomes entitled <br>to Paradise.\" Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) asked for the <br>clarification of the meaning of mixing it up. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"It is to love the worldly <br>life and hanker after it. There are many who talk like the <br>Prophets, but act like the arrogant people and tyrants. If <br>one recites this Kalimah while not indulging in anything of <br>this sort, he becomes entitled to Paradise.\" <br>Hadith No.5 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>i<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"There is <br>nobody who may recite (A1 g!qY) and the doors of the <br>Heavens do not get opened to allow this Kaliinah to <br>reach the Arshi Ilaahi (Allah's throne), provided he <br>abstains from the major sins.\" <br>The extreme excellence and acceptability of this Kali- <br>mah is proved by its going straight to the Arshi Ilaahi <br>(throne of Allah). It has already been stated that its recita- <br>tion, even with major sins, is not without benefit. Muila Ali <br>Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the condition of being <br>free from major sins is the key to quick acceptance and for <br>the opening of all the doors of Heaven; otherwise the reci- <br>tation of Kalimah is not without reward and acceptance, in <br>spite of ma'or sins. Some scholars have explained this <br>hadith to me \\n that, after the death of such a person, all the <br>doors of the Heavens are opened to welcome his soul. <br>According to another hadith, two Kalimahs are such that <br>one does not stop before reaching the Throne of Allah. and <br>the other fills the Heaven and Earth with its light or <br>reward: one is (&I Y'! ii14, and the other is(31g!31$. <br>HadithNo.6 <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahudith on Vjrlues of Kalin~ahl ' ~ ~ , y u b u h115<br>i <br>Hadhrat Shaddaad (Kadhiyallaho anho) relates. while <br>Hadhrat Ubaadah (Radhiyallaho anho) confirms, that <br>once we were sitting with Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) and he asked if there was any stranger (non- <br>Muslim) in the gathering. We submitted that there was <br>none. He then had the door ~ l 9 s e d  and asked us to <br>raise our harids and recite (ir~Y!il!J).We raised our <br>hands for somf: time and recited the Kalimah. He then <br>exclaimed &y!iJ!J, anti said: ''0 Allah! You have sent <br>me with this Kalimah. You have prorrlised paradise for <br>$ <br>v, r-<br>those who profess it, and Your promise never remains <br>unfulfilled.\" Then he turned to us and said: \"Be <br>$3 <br>happy, Allah has blessed you with His forgiveness.\" <br>$ <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had made sure <br>that no stranger was present there, and he had got the <br>door closed, because presumably he had every hope <br>that those particular people would be forgiven by <br>virtue of reciting the Kalimah, and he had no such <br>hope in respect of non-believers.\" <br>The Sufis quote this hadith as an argument for making <br>their disciples engage in zikr collectively. it is stated in <br>Jaarni-ul-[Jsool that there were instances when Rasulullah <br>(Sallallahc alaihe wasallam) made his companions do zikr <br>collectively and individually, and this I-fadith is quoted as <br>authority for doing zikr collectively. In that case, the clos- <br>ing of the door would be to help those present to concen- <br>trate their attention. 'The enquiry about the presence of any <br>stranger might also be for the same purpose: it may not <br>have distracted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>but there was likelihood of others getting distracted. <br>Hadith No. 7 <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Keep on <br>renewing your Imaan. \"0Rasulullah! Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam, how should we renew our Imaan?\" enquired <br>the Sahabah. \"Recite &i!ii!J, <br>very often\", was the <br>reply. <br>Note: <br>In one hadith. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihs wasallam) <br>is reported to have said. \"Like old clothes, the Imaan also <br>gets worn out, hence keep on renewing it through supplica- <br>tion to Almighty Allah.\" That the Imaan gets old and worn <br>out means that it loses strength and radiance on account of <br>sins. Thus it is stated in one hadith that, when a man com- <br>mits h sin. a dark spot appears on his heart. If he then does <br>sincere l'aubah (repentance), this spot gets washed away. <br>otherwise it remains there. When he commits another sin, <br>another black dot appears on the heart. Thus, on account of <br>further sins, the black dots continue to increase, till ulti- <br>mately the heart is all blackened and rusted, as decribed in <br>the Qur'an in Surah Tatfeef.\" <br>b* <br>lJgc &$ * blj *<br>< -<br>Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon <br>their hearts. <br>When such a stage is reached, then th,: heart is no <br>longer influenced by words. It is said in o1.d hadith, \"Four <br>things cause ruination of the heart. namely, debating with <br>stupid people, excessive sinning, excessive mixing with <br>women, and remaining in the society of the dead.\" Some- <br>body enquired, \"What is meant by the dead in this case?\" <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallarrl) explained that it <br>meant such wealthy persons who assume arrogance on ac- <br>count of their wealth. <br>Hadith No. 8 <br>.. -. <br>J <br>,;,*,, <br>.<br>1;\"~ <br>3 (A) <br>0 3 9  <br>Li <br>,&<br>q1<br>&,<br>$<br>ii<br>JG<br>&<br>Gj <br>,<br>2 15 &> &? > L L  & ?\\ +> <br>, <br><br>I <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kulirnuh 'I'uyyubuh <br>I <br>l$as,u13ullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"Recite <br>Y!il!jij very often, before the time of death comes <br>when'you will not be able to say it.\" <br>Note: <br>It means that no deed is possible after death. This life <br>is very short, but it is the only time for action and for <br>sowing the seeds. This life after death is infinitely long. <br>and we will there reap whatever we have sown here. <br>Hadith No. 9 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I know <br>of a Kalimah, such that if anybody recites it with sin- <br>cerity of belief in it and then dies. Hell becomes forbid- <br>den for him. This Kalimah is (3t j!ii~y,.'' <br>Note: <br>This subject matter has been related in many ahadith. <br>If the person referred to in the above hadith has been a new <br>convert to Islam, then there can be no doubt about the <br>meaning, because it is unanimously agreed that on embrac- <br>ing Islaam all the sins committed as a non-Muslim are for- <br>given. But if it refers to an old Muslim, who recites the <br>Kalimah with sincerity just before his death, even then it is <br>hoped that Almighty Allah, through His sheer Grace, may <br>forgive all his sins. Almighty Allah has Himself said that <br>He mav forgive whomsoever He likes, all his sins, except <br>Shirk. <br>, <br>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has stated that <br>some scholars are of the view that these ahadith pertain to <br>the very earlv period of lslaam when detailed command- <br>merits had not yet been revealed. Some scholars have <br>stated that the hadith implies declaration of this Kalimah <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>I<br>with proper discharge of one's obligations enjoined by it, as <br>given under Hadith No 4 above. Hasan Basri (Ratlmatullah <br>alaih) and many others also held the same view. According <br>to the considered view of Imam Bukhari (Rahmatullah <br>alaih) Allah's promise holds good if the declaration of the <br>Kalimah before death is with repentance, which is the es- <br>sence of Taubah while, according to Mulla Ali Qari, the re- <br>citer will not be doomed to Hell-for ever. Moreover, it is a <br>matter of common observation that sometimes the inherent <br>quality of a thing becomes ineffective due to some counter- <br>force. For instance, a purgative may become ineffective if it <br>is followed by a strong constipative drug, but that does not <br>mean that the purgative has become devoid of its inherent <br>effect; it has only not worked because of the strong counter- <br>acting agent. <br>Hadith No 10 <br>Kalimah itself is made up of two parts. one $1 jjig, and the <br>other i1J>;G.<br>Thus. the Paradise may be said to open <br>with these two keys. In these ahadith, wherever the Kali- <br>mah is stated to cause entry into Paradise or protection <br>against Hell, it means the complete Kalimah comprising <br>both the parts. In one hadith. it is said that the price of Par- <br>adise is ($1 u'~ii14. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said \"Profes- <br>sing faith in <br>j!d!~,provides the keys to Paradise.\" <br>Note: <br>The Kalimah has been described as the keys of Para- <br>dise, because it serves as the key for opening every door <br>and every part of Paradise; therefore, the Kalimah consti- <br>tutes all the keys. Or else, it is called the keys, because the <br><br>I <br>Ch. 11: Ahudjth on irirtues of Kc~lirnuh'I'u!.\\'abnh<br>I <br>Hadith No 11 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said. \"1Vhoso- <br>ever recites 3,ii!W, any time during day or night. his sins <br>are remitted from his account and virtues are written <br>instead.\" <br>Note: <br>The replacement of sins by virtues has been fully de- <br>scribed under Hadith No 10 of Chapter 1, part 2, where <br>various meanings of all the aayats and ahadith of this kind <br>are given. According to every version, this hadith categori- <br>cally states that sins are washed away from the account of a <br>person's deeds, provided there is Ikhlaas, that is sincerity <br>of intention. In any case, hymning the blessed name of <br>Al!ah and excessive recitation of Kalimah Tayyibah also <br>develops Ikhlans. That is why this blessed Kalimah is also <br>called the Kalimah of Ikhlaas.\" <br>Hadith No. 12 <br>I., <br>2 <br>&j i&,L hi 2 (\\r) <br>'$1 <br>jo.a.o & L\\ JG f<br>J <br>J. - , * <br>JG \\;$ 2$\\d4 $t4J 2 1 5 2<br>&, j$<br>?+!<br>u,;<br>;$., <br>&\\ .j! i!q <br>, f ,  <br>J$<br>j.$ <br>,$q $2, $i &$<br>-<br>,<br>Juj JjS6<br>;&Wa&>& <br>9 <br># <br>$,\\ <br>.-<br>J ,,r.gp 4) GyJ'j <br>.<br>1s4 p, ~h\"<br>o ' u<br>~ j , 4 + ~ ~ w<br>j 2 d ~ L r , i l i J ~ t - s t r n ~ ~ ~ i ~ ~ b l ~ ~<br>bl+ d <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"There is <br>a pillar of Noor (Divine Light) in front of the Arshi llanhi <br>(the Throne of Allah).

'How can I stop, when the reciter of <br>the Kalimah has not yet been granted forgiveness?' <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Thereupon Allah says: 'Well, I have forgiven him', and <br>then that pillar stops shaking.\" <br>Note: <br>I <br>Some scholars of hadith have doubted authenticity of <br>this hadith, but Allanla Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has <br>written that this hadith (tradition) in different words has <br>been narrated through many sources. According to some <br>narrations. Almighty Allah also says, \"I have made him <br>utter the Kalimah in order that I may grant him forgive- <br>ness.\" How kind and benevolent is Almighty Allah that He <br>himself graces a person with the power to do this virtuous <br>act, and then grants pardon on this basis to complete His <br>extreme favour. In this connection a story told about Hadh- <br>rat Atna (Rahmatullah alaih) is well known. He once hap- <br>pened to go to the market where a woman lunatic slave was <br>on sale. He purchased her. At midnight she got up, per- <br>formed her ablution. and began offering Salaat. During her <br>prayers she wept so profusely that her breath was getting <br>:<br>choked. Then she said: \"0 my Lord! in the name of the <br>love that You have for me, bestow Your Mercy on me.\" <br>Hearing this. Ataa said \"0,slave woman, say: '0Allah, in <br>the name of the love that I have for YOU:\" Upon hearing <br>this she got upset and said, \"By Allah! If He had not loved <br>me, He would not have let you sleep and made me to stand <br>I <br>in prayer as you see!\" Then she recited the following <br>couplets: <br>My restlessness is increasing, and my heart is burning; <br>patience has forsaken me, and my tears are flowirlg. How <br>can one have peace of mind, when one is all upset by the <br>pangs of love and restlessness. 0 Allah! if there is anything <br>which can help me to get rid of my grief, please bestow it <br>upon me as a favour! Then she said, '0 Allah! so far the <br>deal between You and me was known to none,.since it has <br>ceased to be secret now, take me away from here. Saying <br>this, she uttered a shriek and breathed her last. There have <br>been many other incidents like this. It is a fact that only <br>Almighty Allah grants the power to do good. <br><br>Ch. II: Ahucf~fhon \\.'irI~~esol Kulimclh 'l'uj,~u0trh <br>(And if Allah, the Sustainer of the Universe does not <br>will it, you cannot even wish for anything). <br>Hadith No 13 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>Y will neither have fear in <br>\"Those who believe in k~Y! <br>the grave nor on the Day of Resurrection. It is as if I see <br>the spectacle when they 'will rise from their graves, <br>wiping dust from their heads and saying: 'All praise is <br>for Allah, who has cast off (for good) all worry and fear <br>from us. \" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>It is stated in another hadith that those who profess <br>At d! ii!J will experience no affliction at the time of death or <br>in the grave. <br>Note: <br>Hadhrat Ibn Abbaas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Once <br>Hazrat Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) came to Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam): Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) was very much worried, and Jibraa-eel said: <br>'Almighty Allah has sent His salaam to you and has en- <br>quired why you look so sad and worried!\" Although Allah <br>knows whatever is hidden in the hearts, yet by such <br>enquiries Allah means to indicate honour, respect and <br>favours. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, <br>\"0 Jibraa-eel! I am worried about my Ummat, as to how <br>they will (fare) on the Day of Judgement!\" \"Is it about the <br>non-believers or about the Muslims?\" asked Jibraa-eel <br>(Alayhis salaam). \"About the Muslims,\" replied the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Jibraa-eel (Alayhis <br>salaam) then took the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>along to a graveyard where the people of the tribe of Banu <br>Salama were buried; there he struck a grave with his wing <br>><br>. <br>and said <br>,\u2018A b <br>(stand up by the orders of Allah). <br>Out of that grave', an extremely handsome man stood up, <br>and he was reciting <br>Hadhrat Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) told him to go back to <br>his place, which he did. Then he struck another grave with <br>his wing. Out of it stood up an extremely ugly person with <br>black face and worried eyes, who was saying, \"Alas, there <br>is nothing but sorrow, shame and horror!\" Hadhrat Jibraa- <br>eel (Alayhis salaam) told him to go back to his place, and <br>then explained to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), <br>\"The people will rise up on the Day of Resurrection in the <br>same state that they were at the time of their death.\" <br>In this hadith, the people of if<br>g!ii!Y apparently imply <br>those who have close attachment for and remain busy with <br>this Kalimah, just as milkman, shoeman, pearl ma^ and <br>iceman rnean those who deal in and especially stock those <br>particular things. Thus, there is no doubt whatsoever that <br>the people of this Kalimah, will receive this extraordinary <br><br>Ch. 11: AIi(~ditho n  Virl lies oJ'lic~limclh 'l'tryyc~l)c~h 123<br>treatment. In Surah Faatir of the Holy Qur'an, three catego- <br>ries of this Ummat have been described; one category is <br>named al&bckL. <br>(leaders in virtues), about whom it is <br>stated in a hadith that they will enter Paradise without anv <br>reckoning. According to one hadith, a person who recites <br>AI y~ y one hundred times daily will on the Dav of Resur- <br>rection be raised up with his face shining like the full <br>moon. Madhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that those whose tongues remain busy in the zikr of Allah <br>will enter Paradise rejoicing. <br>Hadith No. 14 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) siid. \"On <br>the Day of Judgement, Almighty Allah will select a <br>man from my Ummat and will call him in the-presenc;~ <br>of all mankind, and then 99 registers of his n1isdt:eds. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>each register as long as one can see, will be opened <br>before him. He will then be asked if he denies anything <br>recorded in his account of deeds, or whether the angels <br>who were appointed to record his deeds had been <br>unjust to him in any respect. He will reply in the nega- <br>tive (i.e. he will neither deny anything nor blame the <br>angels for any injustice to him). Then Allah will ask <br>him if he can justify his misdeeds, but he will submit <br>that he has no excuse to offer. Then Allah will say <br>'Well, there is indeed one virtue to your credit. Today <br>no injustice will be done to you.' Then a small piece of <br>I<br>paper with the Kalimah <br>written on it will be handed over to him, and he will <br>be asked to go and get it weighed. He will subniit that <br>this small piece of paper will be of little avail as <br>against so many lengthy registers. Allah will say, \"This <br>day, no injustice will be done to you.\" Then all the <br>registers will be placed in one pan and the piece of <br>paper in the other pan. The pan with the registers will <br>fly up in the air on account of the excessive weight of <br>that piece of paper. The fact is that nothing is weight- <br>ier than the name of Allah.\" <br>Note: <br>It is a blessed result of Ikhlaas that a single recitation, <br>with sincerity, of Kalimah Tayyibah can outweigh all the <br>misdeeds recorded in so manv registers. It is, therefore, <br>necessarv that one should not look down upon anv Muslim <br>and think oneself as superior to him. Who knows that <br>Almighty Allah may accept from him some deeds that may <br>sutfice for his redemption, while nobody can be sure about <br>himself whether any of his own deeds will be found <br>worthy of acceptance. There is related in one hadith the <br>story of two persons belonging to Bani Israa-eel. One of <br>whom was worshipper and the other was a sinner. The <br>worshipper always criticised the latter, who used to reply: <br>\"LeCive me to my Creator.\" One day, the worshipper, in a <br>fit of anger, said: 'By Allah! you will never be forgiven.' <br>Almighty Allah assembled them unto His presence and <br>pardoned the sinner because he alwavs expected n1err:y <br>from Him. but ordered purlishment for the worshipper due <br><br>I <br>i <br>to his swearing upon Allah. No doubt, the oath was serious <br>and offended against the declaration of Allah in the verse <br>(Almightv Allah will not forgive Kufr and Shirk but ex- <br>cepting that. He may forgive any sin as He may like). None <br>else has the right to say that a certain person will not be <br>forgiven, but this does not mean that we should not warn <br>others against sins and undesirable things, and ask others <br>to desist from these. At hundreds of places in the Holy <br>Qur'an and in the books of hadith. there are warnings <br>against not forbidding from evil. It is stated in many aha-<br>dith that the people who see a sin being committed and do <br>not stop it. in spite of their having power to do so, will also <br>co <br>v,<br>share the punishment for that sin. This point has been dis- <br>cussed by me in detail in mv book. Fazaaile Tabligh. which <br>$ <br>can be consulted if desired. There is, moreover. a note of <br>caution. Whereas it is verv wrong to condemn sinful Mus- <br>lims as absolute dwellers of Hell, it is even more dangerous <br>on the part of ignorant people to accept anv person as their <br>spiritual guide, in spite of his being devoid of good prac- <br>tices and his saving senseless and un-Islamic words. Kasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: \"Whosoever <br>respects an innovator in Islam is c:onsideretl to have taken <br>part in dt:niolishing Islam.\" It is stated in several ahi~clith <br>that in tilnes to come, there will appear Inany imposters. <br>cheats and liars. who will relate ahadith that vou will tlavtt <br>never heard before.

It admits of no doubt that nothing can be equal to the <br>blessed name of Allah. It is really a great misfortune and <br>deprivation for those who take it lighty. However, the <br>weight of this Kalimah is proportional to the Ikhlaas with <br>which it is uttered. The greater the Ikhlaas, the weightier <br>becomes the Kalimah. It is to cultivate this Ikhlaas that one <br>has to remain in the service of the Sufis. According to one <br>hadith, the above-mentioned saying of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was in connection with another sub- <br>ject matter. He has said: \"Persuade a dying person to recite <br>(81j!ii~$because he who recites this Kalimah at the time of <br>his death gets entitled to enter Paradise.\" The Sahaba en- <br>quired: \"0 Rasulullah! (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) what <br>about reciting it during good health?\" He replied, \"Then it <br>is even more effective in obtaining entitlement to Para- <br>dise,\" and then stated, on oath, the hadith related above. <br>Hadith No.16 <br>I <br>I <br>There came to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>three non-Muslims who said to him: \"0Muhammad! (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) don't you recognise anybody, <br>except Allah as worthy of worship?\" In reply, Rasulullah <br>(Sallsllaho alaihe wasallam) recited (LIj~j~j,(Nobody is <br>worth\" of worship except Allah), and gdded: \"I have been <br>deputed spscifically for the propagation of this Kalimah, <br><br>Cli. 11: Ali(~dithon Virtues of Kulimuh 'I'ayyabuh 127 <br>and to it I invite al!*manktnd.\" It was in this connection <br>that the verse LW Yi*;i,ji 4 [What thing is ob most weight <br>in testimony) was reve'aled.\" <br>Note: <br>The words of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>namely, \"I have been deputed (as a prophet) specifically <br>for the propagation of this Kalimah, and to it I invite all <br>mankind\" did not mean that only he had been sent on this <br>special mission. In fact, all the Prophets had been deputed <br>for the propagation of this Kalimah, and all of them had in- <br>vited mankind to it. From Aadam (Alayhis salaam) to Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) the last and the best of <br>Prophets, there was not a single prophet who had not <br>propagated this sublime Kalimah. So blessed and sublime <br>*I<br>is this Kalimah, that all the Prophets and all true religions <br>propagated it, and served its cause. In fact, every true relig- <br>ion is based on this Kalimah. It is in support of this Kali- .EN <br>mah that the Qur'anic verse <br>(Y <br>cb~,,ijp$1 '2213 has <br>been revealed, in which Almighty Allah is a witness in <br>favour of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Accord- <br>ing to one hadith, when somebody recites &+!& then <br>Almighty Allah testifies to it and says: \"My slave has <br>spoken the truth; there is nobody worthy of worship except <br>I.\" <br>Hadith No.17 <br>The Prophet Eesa (Jesus) (Alayhis salaam) had said: <br>The deeds of the Ummat of Hadhrat Muhammad (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) would be reckoned weight- <br>iest, on the Day of Judgement, because their tongues <br>are accustomed to the recitation of a Kalimah, which <br>was found too hard by the Um~nats of other Prophets, <br>and this Kalimah is 51+I i i ~ y .  <br>Note: <br>It is a fact that the Umrnat of Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is devoted particularlv to this Kalimah, <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>far more than any other Ummat. There have been hundreds <br>of thousands. nay millions of Sufis (divine persons) every <br>one of whom had hundreds of disciples, all of whom re- <br>cited the Kalimah thousands of times daily as a matter of <br>routine. It is stated in the book 'Jaami-ul-Usool' that the <br>word 'Allah' should be repeated a minimum number of five <br>I <br>thousand times daily alid that there is no upper limit for <br>this, and the Sufis are required to repeat <br>yl j,y, dailv at <br>least twenty five thousand times. This number varies <br>ac:c:ording to the advice of the Mashaaikh. I have related all <br>this in support of the above saying of Hadhrat Eesa (Jesus) <br>stated in his book al-Qowlul jameel that his father as a be- <br>gill~ier in Sufism used to recite ( ~ I Y IJIY, two hundred times <br>in one breath. <br>(Alavhis salaam). Shah Waliullah (Kahmatullah alaih) has <br>Shaikh Abu Yazeed Qurtubi (Rahmatullah alaih) writes: <br>learning that one who recites ,81i1ii!J, seventy thou- <br>\"011 <br>salid times becomes safe from the fire of Hell. I completed <br>this number once for my wife and then several times for <br>my own self as a provision for the Hereafter. There used to <br>live near us a voung man who was known to be blessed <br>with the power of Kashf (divine manifestation of unseen <br>thing). even in respect of Paradise and tiell. but I hesitated <br>to believe it.:Once when this voung inan was tiining with <br>us. lie uttered a cry of agony. his breatlii~ig bec:anit: diffic:ult <br>and he exc:laimed.

But if any fortunate person recites this Kalimah <br>with such sincerity of heart that he is altogether spared <br>from punishment in spite of his sins, no one can question <br>the mercv of Almighty Allah, as already stated under aha- <br>dith 9 and 14 of this chapter. <br>Hadith No. 19<br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) related that he <br>was told bv Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salam) that Almighty <br>Allah s a p :  \"Onlv 1 am Allah; there is none worthy of <br>worship except I, hence worship only Me; whosoever <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>will come to Me with firm faith in (bYJi~<br>Y) will enter <br>My fort, and whosoever enters My fort will be safe <br>from My punishment.\" <br>Note: <br>If the abovementioned blessing is on the condition that <br>one does not commit major sins, as mentioned under <br>Hadith No 5,then there is no ambiguitv about it: but if reci-<br>tation of the Kalimah, in spite of major sins, is implied. <br>then the word 'punishment' implies eternal punishment. <br>However, Allah's Mercy knows no bounds. It is mentioned <br>in the Qur'an that Alrnighty Allah will not forgive the sin <br>of Shirk (polytheism), but will forgive any other sin, as he <br>may like. According to one hadith. Almighty Allah pun- <br>ishes o111v such persons who revolt agaillst him and refuse <br>to recite , i t  yl JI y, . According to another hadith, the recita- <br>tion of <br>( k Y 1JJ <br>removes the wrath of Almighty Allah. as <br>?<br>l<br>)<br> <br>long as one refrains from attaching more importance to the <br>worldly things as compared with the religion; but if one <br>starts preferring the former over the religion, then recita- <br>tion of (51JIj~y, proves of little use, because then Allah <br>says: \"You are not true to what you profess.\" <br>HadithNo.20 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The best <br>form of zikr is (BISI h ~ ) :  <br>and the best form of du'aa is <br>Istighfaar (seeking forgiveness of Allah)\"; then, in sup- <br>port thereof, he recited from Surah Muhammad. the <br>verse <br>So know that 11one is worthy of worship but Allah. <br>It is already given in Hadith No. 1 of this Chapter that <br>( A Y ~<br>JIY, is superior to all other forms of zikr. The rc.asoli for <br><br>I <br>C I i .  11: AIi(~tlilhon Virtues o /K(11i1nclh7'(1!*!ro!~(~h<br>this superiority, according to the Sufis, is that zikr has a <br>special cleansing effect on the heart; by virtue of this zikr, <br>the heart gets purified of all its maladies and, if supple- <br>mented by Istighfaar, this becomes most effective. It is <br>stated in one hadith that when the fish had swallowed <br>Hadhrat Yunus (Alayhis salaam) he recited the prayer <br>and that whosoever supplicates Allah in these words will <br>be granted his prayer. This subject has also been mentioned <br>in Hadith No. 1 of this chapter, namelv that the best form <br>of supplicatiorl is stated to be <br>( 5 &I, . whereas here it is <br>stated to be Istighfaar. This apparent difference is accord-<br>ing to the differing circumstances. For a pious man. (<br>A<br>~<br>J<br>)$ <br>is the best form of supplication, whereas a sinner should <br>% a<br>do Taubah and Istighfaar, and for him Istighfaar is nat- =-i <br>~ r a l l y  the most suitable supplication. For increase of I~en- T <br>efits, praising and glorifying Allah is more effective, while <br>for relieving the evils and hardships, Istighfaar proves to be <br>more effective. There are also several other reasons for this <br>difference. <br>Hadith No. 21 <br>As narrated by Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"Recite ( L I ~ IJ I ~ )and Istighfaar as frequently as vou can, <br>because Shaytaan says: \"I ruin the people by inclining <br>them to commit sins but they frustrate me through <br>their recitation of <br>(&I $ 4 1 ~ )  and Istighfaar. When I find <br>this so, I mislead them to indulge in bid'at and thereby <br>make them follow their base desires in the belief that <br>they are still on the right path.\" <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Note:-<br>The main object of Shavtaan is to inject poison into <br>one's mind, as stated under Hadith No. 14 in part 2 of <br>Chapter I, and he is successful in doing so only when the <br>heart is not engaged in zikr. otherwise he has to retreat in <br>disgrace. In fact, zikr of Allah purifies the heart. It is nar- <br>rated in Mishkaat that Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) had said: \"For every thing there is a cleaner, and the <br>heart is cleansed by means of zikr of Almighty Allah.\" The <br>effect of Istighfaar is similar, as mentioned in many ahadith <br>that it removes the dust and rust from the heart, Abu Ali <br>Daqqaaq (Rahmatullah alaih) writes that when a person re- <br>cites +~ly,with sinceritv, his heart is cleansed of all dirt (as <br>a mirror is cleaned with a wet cloth), and when he says ,ksi,, <br>his heart shines with its light. It is clear that, under these <br>circumstances, the whole effort of Shaytaan is bound to go <br>waste. <br>Ruining through base desires, means that one may <br>begin to consider wrong as right, and give reiigious sanctity <br>to whatever he desires. This practice has been condemned <br>in the Holv Qur'an at several places. At one place it is said: <br>Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire as a god <br>and Allah sendeth him astray knowingly and sealeth <br>up his hearing and his heart, and setteth on his sight a <br>covering? Then who will lead him, after Allah (hath <br>condemned him)? Will ye not then heed? (Surah <br>XLVl23). <br>It is said at another place in the Holy Qur'an: <br>.. <br>Who geteth further astray than one who followeth his <br>lust without guidance from Allah? Lo! Allah guideth <br>not wrong-doing folk. (XXXVIII/50) <br>There are many other verses on the same subject. It is <br>most trc!ac:herous attack of Shaytaan that he presents an <br>t i .  1 :  t <br>i <br>1 o <br>' i l l ~ l t s( 1  i<br>1 ' <br>I <br>I <br>irreligious deed as a religious one, so that one does it as an <br>article of faith and hopes to get reward for it. As the person <br>performs it as a religious act, there is no likelihood of his <br>doing Taubah. If somebody is habituated to obvious sins, <br>like adultery and theft, there is a possibility that he may do <br>Taubah and give them up, but if somebody is doing a <br>wrong thing under the impression that it is religious duty, <br>the question of his doing Taubah does not arise. Rather, he <br>will get more involved in it day by day. This explains the <br>words of the Shaytaan: \"I involved them in sins, but they <br>frustrated my efforts through zikr, Taubah, and Istighfaar: <br>thereu~on 1 entrapped them in such a manner that their <br>escape became impossible.\" <br>'I'hus, it is essential that in all matters of religion, guid- <br>ance be sought frorn the ways of life of Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) and of his Companions (Radhiyal- <br>laho anhum). Doing otherwise is devoid of virtue, and will <br>entail sins. <br>lrnam Ghazali (Rahmatullah alaih) has reported from <br>Hasan Basri. (Rahmatullah alaih) a narrative that Shaytaan <br>says: \"I presented sinful deeds in an attactive form to the <br>Muslims, but they nullified my efforts through Istighfaar. <br>Then I presented before them vices in the garb of virtues, <br>thus leaving no initiative for Istighfaar.\" Instances of such <br>vices are self-made innovations in religious practices. <br>Wahb bin Munabbih (Rah~natullah alaih) says: \"Fear <br>Almighty Allah. who knows everything; you curse Shay- <br>taan in the presence of others, but you quietly obey and be- <br>friend him.\" Some Sufis have narrated: \"It is most <br>unfortunate that, in spite of knowing Almighty Allah as our <br>real benefactor, and ackrlowledgillg His favours, we should <br>show disobedience to Him and obey Shaytaan, whom we <br>know and believe to be most tre~~c.horous <br>and our greatest <br>enemv.\" <br>Hadith No 22 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>is.&C@~jd@JjlydjJ JUI& i<br>~<br>U<br>~<br>~<br>i<br>~<br>k<br>~<br>diplrj. : <br>L J & J , , ~ , , ~ ; L I & W ; ~ ~ Y ~ J ~ Y<br>~ l i ~ q c . J i ~ , 1 ; ? 1 4 b ~ ; r i e ,  <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: <br>\"Whosoever professes sincere belief in i~<br>j+; G81y~j~y <br>at the time of his death, shall certainly enter Paradise.\" <br>According to another hadith, \"He shall certainly be <br>pardoned by Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is also re-<br>ported to have said: \"Listen to happy tidings, and convey <br>them to others as well. that whosoever believes in ,L JJI y, <br>with sincerity of heart, shall enter Paradise.\" It is the Ikh- <br>laas that is valued by Almighty Allah. A small deed done <br>with Ikhlaas (sincerity) earns a great reward: but anything <br>done for the sake of mere show or to please some people, <br>will 'earn no good reward, but punishment from Almighty <br>Allah. That is why a person who recites the Kalimah with <br>sincerity of heart will certainly be pardoned and admitted <br>into Paradise. It may or may not be that he undergoes some <br>punishment for his sins before going to Paradise; but, if <br>Almighty Allah is really pleased with particular deeds of a <br>sinning believer, He may forgive all his sins in the very <br>first instance. When Allah is so Merciful and Gracious, it is <br>our greatest misfortune if we do not serve and obey Him in <br>full. In short, great rewards are promised in these ahadith <br>for one who believes in the Kalimah Tayyibah. Two possi- <br>bilities are however there: he may have to suffer some pun- <br>ishment for his sins according to the general rule before <br>being forgiven, or he may be forgiven forthwith without <br>any punishment by Almighty Allah, out of sheer Mercy <br>and Grace. <br>Yahva bin Akhtam (~ahmatullah alaih) is a Muhad-<br>dith. After his death, somebody saw him ill a dream, and <br>asked him how he had fared. He replied: \"I appeared <br>before Almighty Allah, and He said to me: 'You sinful old <br>man, you did this and you did that', till all my sins were <br>recounted one by one, and I was asked if I had any expla- <br>nation in my defence. I submitted that no hadith to that <br>effect had been conveyed to me. Then Allah asked: 'What <br>hadith had been conveyed to you?' I submitted: \"I was told <br>by Abdur Kazzaaq who was told by Muammar who waz <br>told t)y Zuhri who was tolti bv Ilrkvnh who was told bv <br><br>(;/I. 11: /ihudi1h on Virtues of Kctlimcth 'I'(ty!i(ll)(th 135 <br>Hadhrat .Aa-ishah (Kadhiyallaho anha), who was told by <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was told bv <br>Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam), who was told by You: 'A <br>person who grows to old age in Islam may have deserved <br>punishment on account of his sins, yet as a token of respect <br>for his old age, I pardon him', and You know that I am very <br>old.\" Allah then said, Abdur Razzaaq spoke the truth, <br>Muammar spoke the truth, Zuhri spoke the truth, Urwah <br>spoke the truth, 'Aa-ishah (Radhivallaho anha) spoke the <br>truth, Kasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) spoke the <br>truth, Jibraa-eel (Alayhis salaam) spoke the truth, and what <br>I had said is true.' After that, it was ordered that I should <br>be admitted into Paradise.\" <br>Hadith No 23 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho al'aihe wasallam) said: <br>\"There are obstacles in the way of every action before <br>it reaches Almighty Allah, but recitation of $1$&5!) <br>and the prayer of a father in favour of his son go up to <br>Him unchecked.\" <br>Note: <br>'Going unchecked upto Almighty Allah means that <br>these two actions are accepted without any delay. Whereas <br>there are intermediate stages for other deeds before they <br>reach Allah, these two things go to Him directly. <br>There is a story of a Kaafir king, who was extremely <br>cruel and bigoted against the Muslims. It so happened that <br>he was captured alive in a battle against the Muslims. As <br>he had caused a lot of sufferings to the Muslims, they were <br>naturally very revengeful. They put him in a cauldron <br>placed on fire. At first, he besought his idol gods for help, <br>but finding no response from them he* b7came a Muslim <br>and started continuous recitation of <br>Y!& 9). How sin- <br>cerelv and devotedly he must have been reciting can well <br>Virtue: of Zikr <br>be imagined. At once help came from Almighty Allah in <br>the form of heavy rain, which extinguished the fire and <br>I<br>cooled the cauldron. It was then followed bv a powerful <br>I<br>cyclone which carried away the cauldron and dropped it in <br>a city inhabited by non-believers. He was still engaged in <br>the recitation of the Kalimah. The people there were <br>wonderstruck by this scene, and after listening to his whole <br>story all them also embraced Islam. <br>Hadith No. 24 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says: \"On the <br>Day of Resurrectinn, He!] <br>yould be forbidden for all <br>those who had recited c~lY!o!.j, with the sole aim of <br>earning the pleasure of Allah.\" <br>Note: <br>That a person who recites Kalimah Tayyibah with sin- <br>cerity will, as a rule, be safe from the fire of Hell is con- <br>ditional on his being free from the major sins. Forbidding <br>of Hell for such a person may of course mean that his eter- <br>nal stav therein is forbidden: but who is there to question <br>Almighty Allah if he forbids Hell altogether for the sincere <br>reciter of the Kalimah, in spite of his sins. Mention is made <br>in ahadith of such people whose sins will be enumerated <br>by Almighty Allah on the Day of Judgement. so that they <br>will feel sure of being doomed to heavy punishment, but <br>after their confession, Allah will say to them: '1 covered <br>your sins in your worldly life, and I cover them now and <br>pardon you.' Many similar cases have been related in aha- <br>dith. There is thus little wonder if all the reciters of the Ka- <br>limah may be treated in this way. There are many blessings <br>and benefits in reciting the exalted name'of Allah, so that <br>one should do it as often as possible. How luckv are those <br>blessed souls who understood the virtues of this Kalimah. <br>and devoted their lives fullv to its recitation. <br><br>Hadith No 25<br>I <br>..<br>,<br> <br>JG <br>3 j$G.p a&jjJG <br>& 2 (yo)<br>0 ' ~  <br>h\\<br>sj <br>4A.j <br>+ i  <br>,<br>J& <br>;!<br>. <br> J & ~+Jl <br>> <br>#. <br>J,j ;? r;i JG w..j'!3 ;;rj ;;iJ$ <br>$/& i;ul <br>, .  h <br>* <br>2 *hl; <br>JG <br>y! <br>I <br>G3i&.. >.+i <br>& <br>+q<br>&I <br>L .

Somebody asked him why <br>he was so sad. Ile said: \"I had heard from Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he knew the words <br>which, if recited by a dying person at the time of his <br>death, brings him relief from the pangs of death, so <br>that his face brightens and he dies in happiness. Unfor- <br>tunately I c;ould not enquire about those words from <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and therefore <br>I arn feeling unhappy.\" Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) said that he knew7 those words. Ijadhrat Talhah <br>(Kadhiyallaho anha) jovously asked what those were <br>and Hadhrat Unlar (Radlliyallaho anho) said: \"We<br>know that no words are better than the Kalimah which <br>was offered by Rasulullall (Sallallah~~ <br>qle~he wasallam) <br>to his uncle Abu Taalib and it is (d\\Yl 4).\" Hadhrat<br>Talhah (Kadhiyallaho anho) said \"Hv Allah! it is this, <br>By Allah! it is this.\" <br>Note:<br>It is related and implied in manv ahadit11 that the Kali- <br>mah Tavyibah constitutes light and happiness through and <br>through. Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Rahnlatulla!~ alaih) has stated in <br>his book Mun'ibbihaat: \"'There are ~ I ! , I J  kirlds of darknesses, <br>for which there are five specific lights. The love of the <br>world is a darkness, the light for it is a piety; sin is a dark- <br>ness, the light for which is Taubah; the grave is a darkness, <br>I <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>the light for which is the Kalimah c h l & U  <br>311 i!d! Y) the <br>i <br>next life is a darkness, the light for which is good deeds; <br>and Pulsiraat is a darkness, the light for which is Faith.\" <br>Raabiah Adawiyyah (Rahmatullah alaiha) a well <br>known woman saint, used to remain busy in salaat <br>throughout the night, would sleep a little at the time of <br>early dawn and would wake up abruptly just before the <br>Fajr prayer, blaming herself and saying: \"How long will <br>you lie asleep; sbon you will be in the grave, where you <br>will sleep till the Doomsday.\" At the time of her death, she <br>told her maid-servant that she should be buried in the <br>patched woolen cloak, which she used to wear at the time <br>of Tahajjud prayer, and that nobody should be informed or <br>her death. After her burial according to her wishes, the <br>maid-servant saw her in a dream wearing a very beautiful <br>dress. When asked what happened to her old woolen dress, <br>she replied that it had been deposited with her deeds. The <br>maid servant requested her for some advice, and she re- <br>plied: \"Do zikr of Almighty Allah as much as you can; by <br>virtue of this you will be worthy of envy in the grave.\" <br>At the time of the death of the Holy Prophet (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam), his companions were so <br>much shocked and grieved that many of them became <br>overwhelmed with frustration and doubts of various <br>sorts. Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"I <br>was also one of those who were given to frustration. <br>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) came to me and <br>wished me salaam, but I was too absorbed to be aware <br>of his coming. He complained to Hadhrat Abu Bakr <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) that I was displeased with him, so <br>much so that I did not respond even to his salaam. <br>Then both of them came to me and wished me salaam. <br>and Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) enquired <br>8 3  <br>of me the reason why I had not responded to Umar's <br>Ei5 <br>salaam. Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) said: \"Yes, I <br>swear by Allah, most certainly you did\". Idenied having be-<br>haved like this, and told them I did not even know of his <br>comin and wishing me salaam. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Rad-<br>hiyallAo anho) accepted my explanation, and said that it <br>must have happened so, and that probably I must have been <br>absorbed in some thought. I confessed that Iwas indeed ab- <br>sorbed in deep thought. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) enquired what it was, and I submitted that I <br>was worried because Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam) had died and we had failed to enquire from <br>him the basic thing required for salvation. Hadhrat <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) said that he had made <br>this enquiry from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam). I got up, and praised him saying that only he was <br>worthy of this honour, because he always exelled in <br>matters of religion. Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) then said, I had asked Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) what basic thing was necessary for <br>salvation, and he had replied that whoever accepts the <br>Kalimah that he had offered to his uncle Abu Talib at <br>the time of his death (but which he rejected) will have <br>salvation, and that this Kalimah leads to salvation.\" <br>Note: <br>All the Sahabah were so much upset and overwhelmed <br>with grief and sorrow that even Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho), in spite of his being so brave, held out his <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>sword in his hand and proclaimed: \"I will chop off the <br>head of whosoever.says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam) is dead. He has only gone to meet his Allah, as <br>Hadhrat Moosa (Alayhis salaam) had gone on Mount <br>Toor.\" Some of the Sahabas feared that the death of the <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) meant the end of <br>Islam, some thought that there was no longer any chance <br>for the progress of Islam, whereas some were dumb-<br>founded and could not even speak. It was only Hadhrat <br>Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) who, in spite of his extreme <br>love and attachment with Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wa- <br>sallam), remained firm, calm, and collected. He got up and <br>delivered his forceful address, beginning with the verse <br>j i <br>j <br>, which means \"Muhammad (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is but a messenger; many messengers <br>have passed away before him. Will it be that when he dieth <br>or is slain, ye will turn back on your heels? He who turneth <br>back doth no harm to Allah, but Allah will reward the duti- <br>ful.\" This story has been briefly related by me in my book <br>Stories of Sahabah. <br>Another point made in the above mentioned hadith is <br>on what essential basic thing does salvation depend. It can <br>be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, it may mean: The mat- <br>ters of Deen are many, but what is that on which all these <br>things of 'Deen depehd, and which is indispensable? <br>According to this interpretation, the reply given above is <br>clearly understood: The whole of Deen depends on the Ka- <br>lfmah which is the fundamental tenet of Islam. Secondly it <br>can mean that there are hardships in the path of Deen viz. <br>doubts crop up, the machinations of the devil are a con- <br>stant source of trouble, worldly needs demand one's atten- <br>tion, etc.; how can these be overcome? In this case, the <br>saying of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would <br>mean1 that frequent recitation of Kalimah Tayyibah will <br>help overcome all these difficulties, for it develops sincer- <br>ity of intention, it cleanses the heart, it causes defeat of the <br>devil, and has many other benefits, as mentioned' in all <br>these ahadith. It is said in one hadIth that the Kalimah <br>&I yl d! 9, <br>wards off ninety nine kinds of calami- <br>ties, the least of which is grief, which is a constant worry <br>for a man. <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahudith on Virtues of Kalirnah Tuyyubah <br>Hadith No.27 <br>-<br>+Y j\\<br>\\sjy w $1 d,+3 w $1 dJ3 b  irb Ti1 epb &I + a,i5 <br>1-b JIiJ >I f! i!J ,UI &G $1 4./r YI US <br>JI <br>4 3 L+ Uj.21 icl( <br>'-+& 3 i+L: J(3 Wi &G, <br>,<br>8 2<br>gr;j<br>Hadhrat , Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that he had heard Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasal- <br>lam) saying: \"I know of a Kalimah which, if-recited by <br>a person with sincerity of heart, fobids the fire of Hell <br>to touch him.\", Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>said: \"Shall I tell you what that Kalimah is? It is the <br>same Kalimah by virtue of which Almighty Allah hon- <br>oured Rasulullah (Sallallaho -alaihd wasallam) and his <br>companions, it is the same Kalimah of piety that was <br>offered by Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to <br>his uncle Abu Taalib at the time of his death. It is L $1 ~ I J .  <br>Note: <br>This well known story of Abu Taalib, the uncle of Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is given in the books <br>of Hadith, Tafseer, and history. As he had been helping Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and the Muslims, Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) went to him when he <br>wasabout to die,and said: \"Omy uncle,recite (2 4! ii!J, , even <br>now, so that I may be able to intercede on your behalf on <br>the Day of Judgement, and i may bear witness before Allah <br>that you embraced Islam.\" Abu Taalib replied: \"People will <br>taunt me for having accepted the faith of my nephew for <br>fear of death, otherwise I would have pleased you by recit- <br>ing this Kalimah.\" Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>returned from there deeply grieved. It was in this connec- <br>tion that the Qur'anic verse <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>was revealed, which means: \"Lo! Thou guidest not whom <br>thou lovest, but Allah guideth whom He will.\" It is evident <br>from this incident that those who indulge in sins and bad <br>deeds, and disobey Allah and His Prophet Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaibe wasallam), but think that they will get salva- <br>tion by virtue of the prayer in their favour of some pious <br>person are sadly mistaken. All power rests with Almighty <br>Allah, to whom we should always turn and with whom we <br>should establish our real connection. However, the com- <br>pany of pious men and their prayers and good wishes can <br>help us in achieving this end. <br>Hadith No.28 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: <br>\"After Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam) happened to <br>commit the mistake as a result of which he was trans- <br>ferred from Paradise to this Earth, he used to spend all <br>his time in weeping, praying and repenting, and once <br>he looked up towards the Heaven and prayed: \"0 <br>Allah! I beg Thy forgiveness in the name of Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\" \"Who is Muhammad?\" <br>came the enquiry through Divine revelation. He <br>replied: \"When you had created me. I saw the words <br>L JjL; U d  BI i!d! J written on Your Arsh, and since then <br>I believed that no human being is superior to Muham- <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kulimah I'ayjabuh <br>mad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), whose name ap-<br>peared along with Yours.\" In reply, it was revealed, <br>\"He is to be the last of all the prophets, and will be <br>your descendant. If he were not to be created, you <br>would not have been created.\" <br>Note: <br>How, at that time, Aadam (Alayhis salaam) prayed, <br>wept and besought pardon has been described in many <br>ahadith. Only those who have experienced the agony of the <br>displeasure of a master can have some idea about the plight <br>of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam). On account of the dis- <br>pleasure of earthly masters, a servant gets very much wor- <br>ried, but in the case of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam) it <br>was the displeasure of the Lord of Lords, the Sustainer of <br>the whole universe, and in short the anger of Allah the <br>Great himself over one before whom the Angels were made <br>to bow, and who enjoyed the position of a favourite. The <br>'E; <br>8 3<br>Cs <br>higher the position of a favourite, the more he feels the <br>wrath of the Master, provided he is not mean; and in this <br>case a prophet was involved. Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) narrated that Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam) <br>wept so much that his weeping exceeded the total weeping <br>by all the people of this world, and he remained in sajdah <br>for forty years without lifting up his head even once. Hadh- <br>rat Buraidah (Radhiyallaho anho) also narrated that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: \"The weeping <br>of Hadhrat Aadam (Alayhis salaam), if compared, will <br>exceed the weeping by all the people of the world.\" It is <br>stated in another hadith that his tears would outweigh the <br>tears shed by all his descendants. Under these circum- <br>stances, in how many ways he must have lamented and re- <br>I <br>I <br>pented can well be imagined. In addition, he even begged <br>to be pardoned for the sake of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam).<br>That the Kalimah &I jj;;Gbi!A! 9 is written on the <br>Arsh is corroborated by many other ahadith. Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: \"When I entered <br>Paradise, I saw three lines written in gold on both sides. In <br>the first line was written <br>hl JjL; Gi& 3, g! A! 9 <br>In the second was written <br>u> <br>&Lj <br>&j & G j  U&j sJj <br>Virtues of ;:ikr <br>What we sent in advance (i.e. charity, etc.), we found, what <br>we consumed we enjoyed', and what we left behind we <br>lost), <br>and in the third line was written <br>(People are sinful, but the Lord is forgiving). <br>A saint relates: \"I happened to visit a town in India, <br>and there I came across a tree, the fruit of which resembles <br>the almond and has a double shell. When it ip broken, a <br>rolled green leaf comes out with <br>JjL; 3% <br>Q in-<br>scribed on it in red. When I spoke about it to Abu Yaqoob, <br>the hunter, he was not suprised at all, and told me that in <br>Elah he had caught a fish, which had <br>gl q inscribed on <br>. .<br>one ear and <br>j;; <br>t;;; on the other. <br>Hadith No. 29 <br>Hadhrat Asma (Radhiyallaho anha) relates that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"The greatest <br>name of Allah, which is generally known as Ismul- <br>A'zam, is contained in the following two verses (pro- <br>vided these are recited with Ikhlaas).\" <br>Note: <br>It is stated in several ahadith that whatever prayer is <br>made after the recitation of Ismul-A'zam is granted by <br>Allah. However, scholars differ in specifying the Ismul- <br>A'zam, as is the case with some of the most sublime things <br>that Almighty Allah keeps them partly secret. This results <br>in difference of opinion about their specification. Thus, <br>1 <br>I <br>I <br><br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalirnah 7'aypabah <br>there is difference of opinion about Laylatul Qadr (Night of <br>Power) and in respect of the special time of acceptance of <br>prayer on Friday. This difference of opinion in such mat- <br>ters is a blessing in disguise, as explained in detail in my <br>book on Fadhaail-e-Ramadhaan. Thus, there have been dif- <br>ferent narrations in respect of Ismul-A'zam; that given <br>above is one of these. There have been ahadith too in <br>regard to these two ayaat as follows:- <br>Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyallaho anho) reported that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] had said that no other <br>verse falls so heavy on the most mischievous and wicked <br>devils as the two ayats beginning with <br>According to Ibrahim bin Wasma, the recitation of the fol- la<br>lowing ayats is very effective in cases of mental derange- <br>ment, etc., and whosoever is particular in their recitation <br>will be safeguarded against such maladies; and that these <br>are written on the corner of the Arsh and cause relief to ter- <br>rified children or those who fear of the evil eye. <br>Allama Shami (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted Imam <br>Abu Hanifa (Rahmatullah alaih) as saying that Ismul-A'zam <br>is the word \"Allah\". He has also stated that Allama Ta- <br>haawi as well as other scholars supported this view. The <br>great mystics and Sufis also have reached the same conclu- <br>sion, and that is why the zikr of this Holy word is practised <br>more than anything else by their followers. The leader of <br>the saints. Hadhrat Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (may Allah <br>enlighten his grave), is also of the same view that \"Allah\" <br>is the Ismul-A'zam, provided at the time of its recitation, <br>there is nothing but Allah in one's mind. He further ad- <br>vised that during its recitation ordinary people should <br>think of His grandeur and fear Him, while the spe ialists in <br>zikr should also concentrate on His attributes, an $i the sel- <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>ected few should have in their mind thoughts of nothing <br>else except Almighty Allah. He also stated that it was for <br>this reason that this blessed name is mentioned so many <br>times, in fact two thousand three hundred and sixty times, <br>in the Holy Qur'an. <br>Shaikh Ismail Farghaani (Rahmatullah alaih) relates: \"1 <br>had, for a long time, a keen desire to learn this Ismul- <br>A'zam, and for this purpose I had undergone great hard- <br>ships: I would fast for days together, so much that some- <br>times I would fdll senseless on account of severe hunger. <br>One day, I was sitting in a mosque in Damascus, when two <br>men entered there and stood besides me. To me they <br>looked like angels. One of them said to the other: \"Do you <br>want to learn Ismul-A'zam?\" \"Yes\", replied the other, <br>\"please tell me.\" On hearing this conversation, I became <br>more attentive. The former said, \"It is the word \"Allah\", <br>provided it is recited with Sidqul-Lija (I+ J-1, <br>which <br>according to Shaikh Ismail (Rahmatullah alaih) is the state <br>of mind comparable to that of a drowning person when <br>there is nobody to save him, and he calls Almighty Allah <br>I <br>for help with extreme sincerity. In order to learn the Ismul- <br>A'zam one should possess high qualities as well as endur- <br>ance and self-restraint. There is a story of a pious person <br>who knew the Ismul-A'zam. Once a man came to him and <br>begged that 'he should be taught the Ismul-A'zam: \"You <br>lack the required capability,\" said the pious person. \"No, I <br>am capable of learning it,\" said the supplicant. The pious <br>person then asked him to go and sit at a particular place <br>and then come back and relate to him his observations. The <br>man went there and saw an old man who was bringing fire- <br>wood on his donkey from the jungle. A policeman came <br>from the other direction and started beating the old man <br>and snatched away his firewood. The man was extremely <br>enraged against the policeman and came back to report the <br>whole incident before the pious person, and said that if he <br>had known the Ismul-A'zam he would have prayed against <br>that policeman. The pious man said: \"I learnt the Ismul- <br>A'zam from that very old man who was bringing the fire- <br>wood.\" <br>Hadith No.30 <br>I <br><br> <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 147 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said that <br>Almighty Allah will order on the Day of Judgement: <br>\"Take out of Hell all persons who professed (by!ii!y, <br>and who had an iota of Imaan in their hearts; take all <br>those who recited (L <br>4) or remembered Me in any <br>way or feared Me on any occasion.\" <br>Note: <br>The blessings-that Almighty Allah bestows on account <br>of this Kalimah can be imagined from the fact that if a hun- <br>dred years old man, who practised Kufr and Shirk all his <br>life, happens to recite this Kalimah once with Imaan and <br>VI2 %<br>L <br>sincerity, he becomes a Muslim and all the sins committed <br>EN <br>by him are washed away; and if he happens to commit any <br>sins after he had become a Muslim, even then, by virtue of <br>this Kalimah, he will sooner or later be released from Hell. <br>Hadhrat Huzaifa (Radhiyallaho anho) who was a confi- <br>dant of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had once said: <br>\"A time will come when Islam will become weak arid dim <br>like the worn-out prints on an old cloth, when nobody will <br>even know about fasting, Hajj or Zakaat, till one night even <br>the Qur'an will be lifted from this world, so that no one <br>will remember any ayat. At this time, old men and women <br>will say that they had heard their elders reciting the Kali- <br>mah ( j ~<br>jlilq, and that they would recite it too.\" A pupil of <br>Hadhrat Huzaifa enquired: \"When there is no Hajj, Zakaat, <br>fasting or any other fundamental of Islam, will the mere <br>Kalimah then be of any use?' Hadhrat Huzaifa (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) did not answer, but when his pupil repeated his <br>enquiry a second and then a third time, he replied: \"Sooner <br>or later it will cause deliverance from Hell, deliverance <br>from Hell, deliverance from Hell.\" He implied that the Ka- <br>limah will deliver from Hell after one has undergone the <br>punishment for not observing the fundamentals of Islam. <br>This is what is meant by above mentioned hadith that a <br>person with even an iota of Imaan will be freed from Hell <br>one day. It is als? qarrated in one hadith: \"Vl'hosoever re-<br>cites the Kalimah &I '91 d!J. it will ccjme to his rescue one day, <br>which may be after he has undergone some punishment.\" <br>lirtues of Zikr <br>Hadith No. 31 <br>+ & & ~ ; j g $  <br>I<br>h <br>L <br>I-,<br>4i! w 13 i*' cjE 431 Lj <br>a(,., <br>$1 Y! il!Y<br>* dL;I' 4 P! jLl2' yj d<br>l 4 <br>c;C GI),! jyl #I),Jb i$1 Jl& <br>J ~ J \" ~ ; C ~ ~ ' ~ ~ J !

When a person's <br>outward behaviour is incorrect, his inner mind is bound to <br>be defective as well. Hence every effort is to be made to im- <br>prove the exterior because the interior is dependant on it. <br>2 2<br>and the Sufis lay stress on outward cleanliness through <br>Wudhu. etc., as a first step for attaining inner purity. Those 8 <br>who talk of internal improvement and ignore the external <br>betterment are not right. The external betterment is as im- <br>portant as the internal one. One of the duaas of Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was: <br>0 Allah! make my interior better than my exterior, and <br>i J ~ Fmake my exterior noble and good).

Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked <br>him: \"You look very sad. What is the matter with <br>you?\" He replied: \"My cousin died last night, and I <br>was sitting near him when he breathed his last.\" \"Did <br>you persuade him to recite ;I i!ii!J?\" asked Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam): \"Yes\", said he. \"Did he <br>recite?\" asked Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>\"Yes, he had recited it,\" said he. \"Then certainly he <br>will go to Paradise,\" said the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam). \"What do the living people get if they recite <br>this Kalimah?\" enquired Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho <br>anho). Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said <br>twice: \"This Kalimah will demolish and ever1 elimi- <br>nate their sins.\" <br>Note: <br>Stress is laid in many ahadith on reciting Kalimah near <br>the dead and in the graveyard. It is said in one hadith that <br>the Kalimah +Ii!i!.j, <br>should be recited profusely during a <br>funeral. In another hadith it is said that dii!d!u' (none is <br>worthy of worship except Thee) will be the distinguishing <br>mark of this Ummat, when they pass over the Siraat (the <br>Bridge). In vet another hadith. it is related that when they <br>will rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection. they <br>will be reciting. <br>$& >,;I i!ii! y <br>(Nobody is worthy of worship except Allah, and on Him <br>the faithful will rely).

Abul Abbaas related: \"I was lying sick <br>in the town of Ashbila. I saw a large flock of huge birds of <br>different colours, white, red, green, etc., which were <br>spreading their wings all together and there were many <br>men who were carrying something in big covered trays. I <br>took them as gifts of death, and started reciting the Kalimah <br>Tayyibah hurriedly. Then one of those men said to me that <br>the time of my death had not yet come, and that this was a <br>gift for another believer.\" <br>Just before his death, Hadhrat Umar bin Abdul Aziz <br>(Rahmatullah alaih) asked those around him to make him <br>sit up. After they did so, he said: \"0Allah! You ordered <br>me to do many things, which I could not do, and You for- <br>bade me certain things, but I disobeyed you in them.\" He <br>repeated these words thrice. and then after reciting <br>,iaJ!iij)began to stare in one direction. Somebody asked <br>him what was he looking at He said: \"There are green fig- <br>ures who are neither men nor Jinn\", and then breathed his <br>last. <br>Sombeody saw Zubaidah (Rahmatullah alaiha) in <br>dream and asked her how she fared.

A!Y, <br>also a virtue?\" \"It is the best of all virtues,\" was the <br>reply of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). <br>Note: <br>A minor sin, no doubt, is washed away by a virtuoys <br>deed, but a major one is wiped off, as a rule, through <br>Taubah or of course through the Mercy of Almighty Allah, <br>as explained earlier in this book. In either case, the wiped- <br>out sin is neither written in the account of deeds nor men- <br>tioned anywhere else. So it is said in one hadith that when <br>a man does Taubah, the Almighty Allah makes the scribing <br>angels forget that sin. It is forgotten even by the hands and <br>feet of the sinner, and even by the piece of land where it <br>was committed, so that there is nobody to give evidence for <br>that sin on the Day of Judgement, when the hands, feet, and <br>other parts of the body of the person himself will stand wit- <br>ness for his gopd or bad deeds, as will be explained in <br>Hadith No. 18 of Chapter 2 part 3. <br>The subject matter of the above mentioned hadith is <br>supported by many other ahadith. There are many ahadith <br>to the effect that Taubah from a sin washes it away, as if <br>one had never committed it. Taubah means to repent and <br>feel ashamed of the sin that has been committed, and make <br>a firm resolution not to repeat it. <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe .Wasallam) according to <br>one hadith has said: \"Do wo~ship Allah only, and do not <br>ascribe any partner to Him; be since~e in all your actions es <br>if you are standing before Almighty Allah; consider your- <br>self among the dead; remember Allah near every stone and <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>every tree, so that there are many witnesses in your favour <br>on the Day of Judgement: and if you happen to commit a <br>sin, do some virtue immediately in atonement thereof, so <br>that if the sin is committed in secret the virtue should also <br>be done in secret, and if the sin is committed openly the <br>virtue should also be done openly.\" <br>Hadith No 34 <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said: <br>\"Whosoever recites the following ten times will be re- <br>warded with forty thousand virtues\": <br>Note: <br>Great rewards are mentioned in the books of hadith for <br>reciting Kalimah Tayyibah a certain number of times. It is <br>said in one hadith: \"When you offer an obligatory Salaat, <br>then recite: <br>ten times, because its reward is equivalent to that of releas- <br>ing a slave from bondage.\" <br>Hadith No 35 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>It is said in another hadith: \"Whoever recites: <br>two million virtues will be written to his credit. <br>Note: <br>How great is the kindness and benevolence of <br>Almighty Allah, that He bestows thousands and millions of <br>virtues for the mere recitation of this Kalimah, which <br>action does not involve hard labour or much time; but, un- <br>fortunately we are negligent and remain so much absorbed <br>in our wordly pursuits that we never care to take advantage <br>of these bounties. Almighty Allah grants at least ten times <br>reward for every virtue, provided it is done with Ikhlaas, <br>and then this reward multiplies further according to the <br>degree of sincerity. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>has said: \"When a person embraced Islam, all his previous <br>sins are forgiven, and then every virtue is rewarded ten to <br>seven hundred times, and even more than that as Almighty <br>Allah may please, but a sin is indicated as a single deed <br>and if it is forgiven by Allah it is not even mentioned in the <br>account of deeds.\" According to another hadith, a virtue is <br>noted in the account of a person as soon as he intends to do <br>it, but when it is actually done its reward is increased from <br>ten to seven hundred times, and even more, as Allah may <br>please. There are many ahadith to this effect, that Allah's <br>bounty knows no limits, provided a person tries to deserve <br>it. The pious people keep this thing in view, and so they <br>are not misled by any amount of worldly wealth. <br>(0Allah! make me one of them). <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had said: <br>\"There are six kinds of deeds and four categories of people. <br>Of the deeds, the first two kinds lead to definite results, <br>two carry equivalent rewards while the reward is ten times <br>for the fifth and seven hundred times for the remaining <br>one. Of the first two kinds of deed, one is certain to lead to <br>Paradise a person who is free from Shirk at the time of his <br>death, and the other is certain to lead to Hell a person who <br>L<br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on,Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah <br>is committed to Shirk at the time of his death; of the two <br>kinds of deeds which bring equivlrlent rewards, one is to <br>make firm intention for a virtuous deed (before its actual <br>performance), and the other is to commit a sin which is <br>also recorded as one only. The fifth is to do a noble deed, <br>the reward for which is ten times, while the sixth is to <br>spend wealth in the path of Allah, in which case the <br>reward is enhanced seven hundred times. <br>Of the four categories of people, the first is of those <br>who enjoy prosperity in this world but will face adversity <br>in the Hereafter, the second is of those who face adversity <br>in this world but will enjoy prosperity in the Hereafter; the <br>people in the third category face adversity in both the <br>worlds i.e. they are poor in this life and will be punished <br>'S<br>in the Hereafter, and the fourth category includes those <br>who are well off in both the worlds. <br>r* <br>A person came to Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho <br>anho) and asked him if he had narrated that Almighty <br>Allah multiplies the reward of some virtues one million <br>times. He swore in confirmation that he had heard it <br>exactly like that. According to another version, he had <br>heard it from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that <br>the reward of some virtues is two million times. Almighty <br>Allah says in the Holy Qur'an &J+ <br>2d > rjijWfr;) that <br>He multiplies the virtues and grants from His treasure great <br>rewards. Who can imagine the extent of the reward which <br>has been described as great by Almighty Lord? <br>According to imam Ghazali, (Rahmatullah alaih] the <br>great reward will be possible only if we recite these words <br>with full concentration on their meanings, because import- <br>ant attributes of Almighty Allah are described therein. <br>L <br>Hadith No 36 <br><br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"When a <br>person performs wudhu (ablution) properly (i.e. ob- <br>serving all its essentials as well as details) and then re- <br>cites: <br>(I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship <br>except Allah, the One who has no partner, and also <br>that Muhammad is His slave and prophet), all the eight <br>gates of Paradise are thrown open for him, so that he <br>may enter as he likes, through anyone of them. <br>One gate is enough for entering into Paradise, but <br>opening of all the eight gates is a mark of special welcome <br>and extreme favour. According to another hadith, a person <br>who did not indulge in Shirk before his death, and never <br>committed any unlawful murder, is allowed to enter para- <br>dise as he may like through any one of its gates. <br>Hadith No. 37 <br>A erson who recite6 (bu'lope hundred times a day, <br>wii'1 on the Day of Resurrection, be raised with his face <br>shining like the full moon, and none can surpass him <br>in excellence on that day except one who recites this <br>Kalimah more than he. <br>Many ahaadith and ayaat confirm that ( i t 4 1  <br>is a light <br>for the heart as well as for the face. It has been observed <br>41 j <br>Ch. 11: Ahadith on Virtues of Kalimah Tayyabah 157 <br>that the pious people who are used to reciting this Kalimah <br>excessively have a sort of brightness over their faces, even <br>during their earthly life. <br>Hadith No. 38 <br>Rasulullah (Sal\\allaho alaihe wasallam) says. \"Teach <br>the Kalimah (LIY!~!Y) to a child when h~ s!arts speaking <br>and persuade a dying person tp r,ecite (btY! a!%. He who <br>has hads his beginning with (aY!a!Y) and has his end <br>with <br>YIil!~),<br>he would not be required to account for <br>any of his sins, even though he lives for thousand <br>years, (i.e. either he would commit no sin, or if he hap- <br>pened to commit any sin, it would be written off by <br>virtue of Taubah or through the sheer mercy of <br>Almighty Allah).</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>158 <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Note: <br>The best way to persuade a dying man to recite the Ka- <br>limah is that those sitting near him should recite it, so that <br>on hearing it he may also do the same. He should not be <br>compelled to do it, because he is dying in agony. That a <br>dying person should be persuaded to recite the Kalimah <br>has been stressed in many ahaadith. In several ahaadith, <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have <br>said, \"The sins of a person who is blessed to recite the Ka- <br>limah at the time of death are washed off just as a building <br>is washed away by flood water.\" According to other ahaa- <br>dith, one who recites this blessed Kalimah before his death <br>gets all his past sins forgiven. It is said in one hadith that a <br>hypocrite is never able to recite it (at the time of hjs death). <br>It is said in another hadith that we should give ~ & I Y ! ~ I Y ,as <br>provision to our deceased ones. According to a hadith. <br>one who brings up a child till he is able to recite <br>will not be required to render any account. In one hadith it <br>is said, \"When a person who has been steadfast in offer- <br>ing salaat is about to die, an Angel comes to him, drives <br>away the Satan and persuades him to recite the Kalimah <br>(A1 j>; G d  i li!ii!3). <br>It is however often observed that this sort of yersua- <br>sion proves useful only in case of those who are accus- <br>tomed to the recitation of the Kalimah during their lifetime. <br>A story is related about a person who used to trade in <br>straw: When he was about to die, people tried to persuade <br>him to recite the Kalimah, but he only cried out. \"The price <br>of this bundle is so much and of that is so much.\" Many <br>such incidents. which had been actually observed, have <br>been described in the book. \"Nuzhatul Basaateen\". <br>Sometimes, involvement^ in a sin prevents a dving <br>person from reciting the Kalimah. The Ulama say that <br>opium has seventy disadvantages, one of which is that the <br>opium-user cannot recollect the Kalimah at the time of his <br>death. On the contrary. brushing one's teeth (with mis- <br>waak) carries seventy benefits. one of which is that to recite <br>Kalimah at the time of his death. It is related about one <br>man that, when he was persuaded before his death to recite <br>the Kalimah. he expressed his inabilitv to recite, because <br>he said, he used to cheat through underweighing. There is <br>a story of another persorl who, when persuaded to recite <br>the Kalimah, said. \"I cannot say it, because I was tempted <br>to cast sinful looks on a woman who had come to purchase <br>I</p></div>"

In view of the foregoing. it <br>is essential for a man to ask and seek Allah's help, forgive- <br>ness of his sins, and to recite the Kalimah at the time of <br>one's death. <br>Hadith No.39 <br>h <br>O <br>' . # ,  <br>I<br>-<br>JI Y! d!

It is the pre-requisite for the ac- <br>ceptance of Salaat. Fasting, Hajj and Zakaat. because unless <br>there is Imaan, no action is acceptable. Recitation of Kali- <br>mah Tayyibah, which amounts to profession of faith, is not <br>dependent on anything else. If a person has only Imaan and <br>no other virtue in his account, sooner or later he is bound <br>(through the grace of Allah) to get admission into Paradise. <br>On the other hand, if a person does not possess Imaan. then <br>no amount of good deeds will be sufficient for his salva- <br>tion. <br>The second part of the above-mentioned hadith is that <br>the Kalimah does not let any sin remain unwashed. It is <br>unanimously agreed that if a person embraces Islam in his <br>old age, and immediately after recitation of the Kalimah he <br>happens to meet his death, then all his sins which he had <br>committed at 3 disbelievt before his declaration of Imaan <br>are remitted. If, however recitation of the Kalinlah in an <br>earlier stage is implied, then the hadith means that the <br>Kalimah purifies and polishes the heart, and its excessive <br>recitation will cleanse the heart, to such an extent that he <br>must do Taubah, which will result in the forgiveness of his</p></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><p>Chapter 1 <br>SECTION 2 <br>AHAADITH ON ZIKR <br>(REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH) <br>When the importance of zikr has been emphasised in <br>so many verses of the Holy Qur'an, the number of ahaadith <br>on this subject is naturally far too great; it is in proportion <br>to the many voluminous books of ahaadith. The Holy <br>Qur'an is one book of only 30 parts, but the books of ahaa- <br>dith are many and each book contains a large number of <br>ahaadith. For example, Bukhari Shareef alone consists of <br>30 voluminous parts, and similarly Abu Dawood Shareef <br>has 32 parts. There is no book of ahaadith which does not <br>contain several ahaadith on the subject of zikr, and it is, <br>therefore impossible to quote all such ahaadith in this <br>small booklet. Of course, a single verse of the Holy Qur'an <br>or a hadith moves the faithful-to good actions, but volumes <br>of books would not move an unwilling person, who is like <br>an ass carrying a load of books. <br>Hadith No 2 7 <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrated <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, <br>\"Almighty Allah says, 'I treat my slave (man) accord- <br>ing to his expectations from Me, and I am with him <br>when he remembers Me, If he remembers Me in his <br>heart, I remember him in My heart; if he remembers <br>Me in a gathering, I remember him in a better and <br>nobler gathering (i.e. of angels). If he comes closer to <br>Me by one span, I go towards him a cubit's length, if he <br>comes towards Me by a cubit's length, I go towards <br>him an arm's length, and if he walks towards Me, I run <br>unto him.\" <br>Note: There are several points elaborated in this <br>hadith. The first point is that Allah deals with a man <br>according to his expectations from Him. One should there- .s <br>fore always be hopeful of the mercy and benevolence of <br>9;<br>Almighty Allah and never be despondent of His blessings. <br>y N <br>Certainly, we are extremely sinful and justly deserve pun- <br>ishment on account of our evil deeds, yet in no case should <br>we feel despondent of the mercy of Allah, as He may per- <br>haps totally forgive us. <br>\"Lo! Allah forgiveth not if a artner be ascribed unto <br>Him and forgiveth all save that to w \\om He will.\" <br>But Almighty Allah may or map ,not forgive; that is <br>why the Ulama say that true belief lies in between hope (of <br>forgiveness of Allah) and fear (of His wrath). The Holy <br>Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) once visited a young <br>Sahabi, who was breathing his last, and asked him how he <br>was feeling. He replied, \"O!Messenger of Allah, I am hope- <br>ful of the mercy of Allah, and yet I am afraid of my sins.\" <br>Thereupon the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said \"When the heart of a believer is filled with these two <br>feelings of hope and fear, Almighty Allah fulfils his hope <br>and saves him from what he is afraid of.\" <br>It is mentioned in one hadith that a believer thinks of <br>his sin, as if he is sitting under a huge rock that is threaten- <br>ing to fall on him, while for a transgressor his sin is no <br>more than a fly which is easily scared off, i.e., he takes his <br>sins very lightly. In short, one should be appropriately <br>afraid of ones sins, and at the same time remain hopeful of <br>Allah's mercy. <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyallaho anho) died of the <br>plague and, in the moments of death's agony, he fainted <br>many times. Whenever he regained consciousness for a <br>moment, he would say, \"Oh Allah! Thou knowest that I <br>love Thee. By Thy Honour and Glory, Thou knowest this <br>very well.\" Just before breathing his last, he said, \"0Death, <br>you are a welcome guest but have come at a time when <br>there is nothing in the .house to eat.\" Then he said, \"0 <br>Allah! Thou knowest very well that I always feared Thee, <br>and today I die hopeful of Thy forgiveness. 0 Allah! I en- <br>joyed life, not in digging canals and planting gardens, but <br>in remaining thirsty in the hot weather, in undergoing <br>hardships for the sake of Islaam, and in taking part in the <br>gatherings engaged in zikr under the supervision of the <br>lama.\" <br>Some Ulama have written that the fulfilment of expec- <br>tations promised by Almighty Allah in the aforesaid hadith <br>is in its most general sense. It carries assurance not only in <br>respect of forgiveness but also in respect of prayers, health, <br>wealth and safety. For instance when a person prays to <br>Allah and sincerely believes that Allah shall accept his <br>prayer, then his prayer is actually accepted, but if he has <br>doubt (that his prayer would not be accepted), it is not ac- <br>cepted. Thus, in another hadith it is stated that the prayer <br>of a person is granted so long as he does not say that his <br>prayer is not granted. The same is true in the case of all <br>blessings relating to health, prosperity, etc. According to <br>one hadith, if a destitute perssn discloses his hunger to <br>everybody, he is not relieved of his poverty, but if ,he <br>shows submission to Gracious Allah, his condition may <br>soon change for the better. However, hoping for the better <br>from Almighty Allah is one thing, and being over-confident <br>of His help and forgiveness is another thing. Almighty <br>Allah has warned us against such an attitude in several <br>verses of the Holy Qur'an e.g. <br>ij$\\ .A4.$3 yj <br>\"Let not the deceiver (the Satan) beguile you in regard <br>to Allah\" i.e. one should not be misled by the devil to <br>commit sins just because Allah is the most Merciful <br>and the Forgiver\". <br>There is another verse, <br>* , * + J , * I ; J + ~ \\ $  <br><br>Ch. 1: Ahaadith on Zikr <br>\"Hath he knowledge of the Unseen, or hath he made a <br>pact with the Beneficent. No, never.\" <br>The second point in this hadith is \"Whenever a slave <br>of mine remembers Me, I am with him.\" In another hadith, <br>it is stated, \"So long as one's lips move in My remem- <br>brance I remain with him\" i.e. Almighty Allah bestows His <br>special care and mercy on him during all this time. <br>The third point is that Almighty Allah mentions him <br>with a favour to the angels, which signifies the value of <br>zikr. Firstly, this is because Allah created man such that in- <br>herently he is liable to be good as well as to go astray, as <br>given below in Hadith No. 8. Submission on his part there- <br>fore deserves special appreciation. Secondly, at the time of <br>Aadam's creation, the Angels (who have no instinct for <br>doing evil) could not understand the creation of man and <br>had contended that he would cause blood-shed and trouble <br>+<br>O <br>in the world, while they are always there to praise and <br>glorify Almighty Allah. Thirdly, man's worship of Allah 13 <br>and submission to His will is more commendable than that <br>of the Angels, because he does so on account of his faith in <br>the unseen which, however, is actually seen by the angels. <br>It is to this fact that Allah refers in the Holy Book: \"How <br>would man not have worshipped if he had actually seen <br>the Paradise and the Hell.\" It is for this reason that <br>Almighty Allah praises the noble deeds of those who <br>worship and glorify Him without seeing Him. <br>The fourth point contained in the above-mentioned <br>hadith is that if a man increases his devotion to Almighty <br>Allah, the increase in His mercy and kindness upon him is <br>proportionately far greater. \"Getting near\" and \"running\" <br>signify immediate increase in His blessings and mercy. <br>Thus, it is upto a person that, if he wants to enjoy more <br>kindness and favours from Almighty Allah, he should in- <br>crease his devotion to Him. <br>The fifth point in the above mentioned hadith is that <br>the Angels have been stated to be superior to man, while it <br>is commonly known that man is the best creation of Allah. <br>One reason for this,has already been explained in the trans- <br>lation (of the hadith), that the angels are superior because <br>they are innocent and are unable to commit sins. Secondly, <br>they are superior because they are better than the majority <br>of men, including even the majority of believers; arid yet <br>some selected Believers like the Prophets (Alaihimus <br>salaam) are superior to the angels. There are other reasons <br>Virtues of Zikr <br>as well, which are however left out in order to prevent the <br>discourse from getting too long. <br>Hadith No.2 <br>A Sahabi once said, \"0,Rasulullah, (Sallallaho alaihe <br>wasallam), I know that the commandments of Sharee- <br>at am many, but of these tell me the one that I may <br>practise assiduously throughout my life.\" The Prophet, <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), replied, \"Keep ydUr <br>tongue always moist (i.e. busy) with the zikr of Allah.\" <br>According to another hadith, Harat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) has said, \"Once at the time of my departure <br>from Rasulullah [Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), I asked <br>him to advise me of that action which is most pleasing <br>to Almighty Allah: whereupon he replied, \"At the time <br>I <br>of your death, your tongue should be busy with zikr of <br>Almighty Allah.\" <br>Note: By \"my departure\", Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyal- <br>laho anho) refers to the occasion when he was appointed <br>by the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as the <br>Governor of Yemen and sent there for teaching and propa- <br>gating Islaam. It was at the time of that farewell that Rasu- <br>lullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had given him some <br>parting instructions.</p></div>"

These surahs are short, but excel in virtues <br>and rewards. In addition, there are one or two important <br>matters, about which the readers of the Qur'an need to be <br>warned. <br>HADITH-1 <br>Hadhrat 'Abdul Malik bin Umair (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) <br>said, \"In surah Fatihah there is a cure for all ailments.\" <br>The virtues of surah Fatihah are found in many aha- <br>dith. It is reported in one hadith, \"a Sahabi was offering <br>nafl salaat; Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) called <br>him, but since he was offering salaat he did not respond. <br>After completing +e salaat he went to Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>!ah0 alaihe wasallgm), who asked him why he did not re- <br>spond as soon as he\\ was called. He submitted that he could <br>not do so because he was offering salaat. Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaih ei.<br>wasallam) asked if he dit not read the following <br>verse in Qu 'an: <br>Respond to the call of Allah and His Messenger when- <br>ever They call you. <br>Then Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"I tell <br>you of a surah which is the greatest, the most virtuous in <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the Holy Qur'an. It is surah Al-Hamd (The first surah of the <br>Qur'an), which has seven ayaat. These are the 'Sab'ul <br>I <br>Mathaani' and represent the Grand Qur'an.\" It is said by <br>some Sufia that whatever there was in the earlier Divine <br>I <br>Books is condensed in the Glorious Qur'an, and the con- <br>tents of Qur'an are condensed into 'surah Fatihah; and that <br>which is in surah Fatihah is found in Bismillaah and that <br>which is in Bismillah is to be found in its first letter .,(ba). <br>It is explained that sf (ba) is a co-ordinating conjunction <br>and stands for uniting. Surely the ultimate aim is to effect <br>I <br>union of a devotee with Almighty Allah. Some 'Sufia' have <br>I <br>gone still further and have said that whatever there is in 4, <br>i <br>(ba) is to be found in its dot, which signifies the Unity of <br>Allah-a thing which is indivisible as a dot. <br>Some scholars are reported to have said that the verse- <br>\"We worship Thee and we seek Thy help\", is prayer <br>for fulfilment of all our objectives, both worldly and spiri- <br>tual. According to another hadith, Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said, \"By Him Who is <br>in possession of my life, a surah like this one has neither <br>been revealed in the Torah nor in the Bible nor in the <br>Psalms, nor even in the rest of the Qur'an. <br>I<br>The Mashaa'ikh have stated that the reading of surah <br>Fatihah with firm belief and faith cures all maladies, <br>whether spiritual or worldly, external or internal. To use <br>its writing as an amulet, and also licking its writing is <br>useful in the treatment of diseases. It occurs in Sihaah (the <br>six authentic books oftHadith) that the Sahabah used to <br>read surah Fatihah and blow upon those bitten by a snake <br>or a scorpion, and even on the epileptic and on the men- <br>tally deranged. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had <br>~ <br>also approved of this. There is another riwaayat to the <br>effect that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) recited <br>this surah and blew on Saa'ib bin Yazeed and applied his <br>saliva on the spot (where some pain was felt by the latter). <br>According to another hadith, it is said that if, at the time of <br>going to sleep, one reads surah Fatihah ,and surah Ikhlaas <br>and blovs on himself he will be immune from all dangers <br>except death. <br>According to one riwaayat, surah Fatihah is equivalent <br>to two-thirds of the Qur'an in reward. It is also reported <br><br>Part 11 (Hadith 1) <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said, \"I <br>have been given four things from the special treasure of the <br>Arsh, from which nothing has ever been given to any one <br>before. These are surah Fatihah, Aayatul Kursi, the con- <br>cluding ayaat of surah Baqarah and Surah Kowthar.\" Hadh- <br>rat Hasan Basri (Rahmatullah alaih) reports the saying of <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that whoever reads <br>surah Fatihah is like one who reads the Torah, the Gospel, <br>the Psalms and the Glorious Qur'an. <br>It is reported in one hadith that the devil lamented, <br>wept and threw dust on his head on four occasions; first, <br>when he was cursed; secondly when he was cast out of <br>Heaven unto the earth; thirdly when Hadhrat Muhammad <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was given the Prophethood, <br>and fourthly when surah Fatihah was revealed. <br>It is reported from Sha'bi (Rahmatullah alaih) that once <br>a man came to him and complained of pain in his kidney. <br>Sha'bi (Rahmathulla alaih) advised him to read Asaasul <br>Qur'an (the foundation of the Qur'an) and blow on the <br>aching spot. When he inquired what was meant by \"Asaa- <br>sul Qur'an\", Sha'bi replied, \"Surah Fatlhah.\" <br>It is written in the established practices of mashaa'ikh <br>that surah Fatihah is the Isme A'zam (r.kc'lr.l),the Most <br>Glorious Name of Allah, and it should be read for the <br>achievement oE all our objectives. There are two ways of <br>reading it: <br>One method is to read this surah forty-one times for <br>forty days, in the interval between the sunnat (a practice of <br>the Holy Prophet) (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and fardh <br>rak'aats of the Fajr salaat. The meem of ?>I 2>1ItJ (Bis-<br>millaahir rahmaanir raheem) should be read jointlv with <br>the laam of - .  <br>(Alhamdu lillaahil. Whatever the ob- <br>A U I  <br>jective may be, it will, insha-Allah (if Allah wills), be ful- <br>filled. In the treatment of a patient or of one who is <br>bewitched, it should be recited and blown on water to be <br>used for drinking. <br>The second method is to read it seventy times between <br>the sunnat and the fardh rak'aat of the Fajr salaat on the <br>first Sunday of a new moon, after which the number is <br>reduced by ten every day until the course ends with a <br>reading of ten times on the seventh day. Then this weekly <br>course should be repeated, so as to complete four weeks. If <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>the purpose is achieved at&e end of the first month, well <br>and good, otherwise this-course should be repeated for the <br>second and, if necessary, for the third mwth. <br>The surah is also written with water of roses, musk <br>and saffron, on a porcelain dish, then the writing is washed <br>off and the wash-water is given to the patient for d~iAkifTg <br>for forty days. This is a sure treatment of chronic diseases. <br>To read it seven times and then blow on the patient is simi- <br>larly an accepted treatment for toothache, headache and <br>pain in the stomach. <br>All these points have been briefly quoted from the <br>book 'Mazaahir-e-Haq.\" <br>'Muslim Sharif' contains a hadith in which Ibn 'Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that once Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) was sitting among us and said, \"In <br>Heaven a door has been opened today which was never <br>opened before, and out of it has descended an angel who <br>had never descended before. The angel said to me, \"Re- <br>ceive the good news of two 'antvaar' which have not been <br>bestowed upon anyone else before. One is surah Fatihah <br>and the other the concluding portion of surah Baqarah, i.e. <br>its last 'ruku' (section of the. Qur'an)'.\" These two surahs <br>have been called 'noor', because on the Day of Judgement <br>these will travel in front of their readers (illuminating their <br>path). <br>HADITH- 2 <br>Hadhrat 'Ataa' bin Abi Ribaah, (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>says that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is re- <br>ported to have said, \"Whoever reads surah Yaaseen in <br>the beginning of the day, all his needs for that day are <br>fulfilled.\" <br>Many merits of surah Yaaseen are mentioned in aha- <br>dith. It is said in one hadith, \"Everything has a heart, and <br>the heart of the Glorious Qur'an is surah Yaaseen. Whoever <br>re.eds surah Yaaseen, Almighty Allah records for him a <br>reward equal to that of reading the whole Qur'an ten <br>times.\" <br>Part II (Hadith 2 )<br>According to another Hadith Almighty Allah recited <br>surah Yaaseen and surah Taahaa one thousand years before <br>the creation of Heaven and Earth, and on hearing this the <br>angels said, \"Blessing is for the ummat unto whom the ,,<br>Qur'an will be sent down, blessing is for the hearts that 5 <br>-Z<br>will bear, i.e. memorize it, and blessing is for the tongues <br>that will recite it.\" <br>t3 <br>There is other riwaayat like this, \"Whoever reads surah 3 <br>Yaaseen for the pleasure of Allah only, all his earlier sins <br>are forgiven. Therefore make a practice of reading this <br>surah over your dead.\" <br>According to one hadith, surah Yaaseen is named in, <br>Torah as mun'imah (giver of good things), because it con- <br>tains benefits for its reader in this life as well as in the <br>Hereafter; it removes from him the afflictions of this world <br>and the next; and takes away the dread of the next life. <br>This 'surah' is also known as 'Raafi'ah Khaafidhaah', <br>i.e., that which exalts the status of the believers and de- <br>grades the unbelievers. According to a riwaayat, Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"My heart desires that <br>surah Yaaseen should be present in the heart of everyone of <br>my ummat.\" According to another hadith, if anybody re- <br>cites surah Yaaseen every night and then dies, he dies as <br>shaheed (martyr). <br>It is reported in another hadith \"Whoever reads surah <br>Yaaseen, is forgiven; whoever reads it in hunger, is satis- <br>fied; whoever reads it having lost his wa finds the way; <br>whoever reads it on losing an animal fin d's the same. And <br>when one reads it apprehending that his food will run <br>short, that food becomes sufficient. And if one reads it <br>beside a person who is in the throes of death, the same are <br>made easy for him. And if anyone reads it on a woman ex- <br>periencing difficulty in child-birth, her delivery becomes <br>easy.\" <br>Maqri (Rahmatullah alaih) said, \"If surah Yaaseen is <br>read by one who fears the ruler or an enemy, he gets rid of <br>this fear.\" According to another hadith, if somebody reads <br>surah Yaaseen and surah Was-Saaffaat on Friday and begs <br>of Allah something, his prayer is granted. (Most of the <br>above has been drawn from Mazaahir-e-Haq, though the <br>scholars of hadith have questioned some of the riwaayaat). <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>HADITH- 3 <br>Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulul- <br>lah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Whoever reads <br>surah Al-Waaqi'ah every night, starvation shall never <br>afflict him.\" <br>Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho qnho) used to command his <br>daughters to recite this surah every night. <br>The virtues of surah Al-Waaqi'ah are also reported in <br>many ahadith. There is a riwaayat to the effect that who- <br>ever reads surahs al-Hadeed, Al-Waaqi'ah and Ar-Rah-<br>maan, is reckoned amongst the dwellers of Jannat-ul-<br>Firdaus (the highest level of Paradise). In another hadith, it <br>is stated that surah Al-Waaqi'ah, is surah Al-Ghinaa. Read <br>it and teach it to your children. Another riwaayat says: <br>\"Teach it to your wives.\" Hadhrat 'Aa'ishah (Radhiyallaho <br>anha) is reported to have emphasized its reading. But it is <br>low mentality on our part to read it only for sake of petty <br>worldly gain. If instead, it is read for the contentment of <br>the heart and for the sake of the next world, then worldly <br>gains will come to us without the asking. <br>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, <br>\"There is in the Qur'an a surah of thirty ayaat which <br>intercedes for a person (its reader) until he is forgiven. <br>This is surah Tabarakal lazi. \" <br>About surah Tabarakal lazi, there is a riwaayat also <br>that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"My <br><br>Part 11 (Hadith 4) <br>heart desires that this surah should be in the heart of every <br>believer.\" <br>According to a hadith, one who reads surah Tabarakal <br>lazi and Alif-Laam Meem-Sajdah, between the Maghrib 3 3<br>(dusk) salaat and the Ishaa' salaat, is like a person who 8-,<br>stands in Salaat throughout the night called Lailatul Qadr <br>8 &<br>(27th night of Ramadhaan-the month of fasting and the 9th <br>S;6 <br>z<br>month of the Islamic calendar). It is also reported that if <br>somebody reads these two surahs, seventy virtues are <br>added to his account and seventy sins are condoned. <br>According to another riwaayat, if one reads these two <br>surahs, a reward equal to that of standing in salaat through- <br>out Lailatul Qadr is writtep for him. This is also mentioned <br>in Mazaahir. <br>Tirmidhi (Rahmatullah alaih) reports from Ibn Abbas <br>(Radhiyallaho anho): \"Some sahabah pitched a tent, at a <br>place without knowing that there was a grave at that place. <br>All of a sudden, those who were putting up the tent heard <br>somebody reciting surah Tabarakal lazi. They reported the <br>matter to Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who ex- <br>plained to them that this surah guards against Allah's chas- <br>tisement and ensures deliverance.\" <br>Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulullah (Sal- <br>lallaho alaihe wasallam) would not go to sleep until he had <br>recited the surahs Alif Laam Meem-Sajdah and Tabarakal <br>lazi. <br>Khalid bin Ma'daan (Radhiyallaho anho) has said that <br>he had heard it narrated, \"There was a man who was a <br>great sinner, but he used to recite surah Sajdan. He never <br>read anything else. This surah spread its wings over that <br>man and submitted to Allah, '0, my Lord! this man used to <br>recite me very frequently'. So the intercession of that surah <br>was accepted. It was ordered that each sin in his account <br>should be substituted by a virtue.\" Khalid bin Ma'daan <br>(Radhiyallaho anho) has also reported, \"This surah pleads <br>for its reader in the grave and says, '0, Allah! if I am con- <br>tained in Thy Book, then accept my intercession, otherwise <br>write me off from Thy Book. This surah appears in the form <br>of a bird, spreads its wings over the dead and guards him <br>against punishment in the grave.\" He has reported all these <br>merits for surah Tabarakal lazi as well. He himself would <br>never go to sleep unless he had read these two surahs. <br>Taa'oos (Rahmatullah alaih) has said, \"These two <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>surahs carry sixty virtues in excess of those carried by any <br>other surah.\" <br>The punishment in the grave is not an ordinary affair. <br>After death, the first stage that one has to pass through is <br>the grave. Whenever Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) <br>stood by a grave, he used to weep so much that his beard <br>would become wet with tears. Somebody asked him why <br>he wept more at the mention of the grave than he did at the <br>mention of Heaven and Hell. He replied, \"I have heard <br>from Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that the grave <br>is the first stage towards the Hereafter. Whoever is saved <br>from chastisement in it, for him the subsequent events <br>become easy, and whoever is not saved from chastisement <br>in it, for him the coming events will be harsher still. And I <br>have also heard that no scene is more horrible than that of <br>the grave.\": <br>0,Allah! save us from this punishment through Thy <br>Mercy and Grace. <br>HADITH- 5 <br>I <br>Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) says: \"Somebody asked <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as to which of <br>the acts is the most virtuous. Rasulullah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam) replied <br>Jw ('al-haal wal-murta- <br>i <br>hil'). The man inquired, '0, Rasullulah (Sallallaho <br>alaihe wasallam)! what is 'alah-a1 wal murtahil?' Rasu- <br>lallah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied, \"It is that <br>particular reader of the Qur'an who starts reading from <br>the beginning and continues till he reaches its end, <br>and after the end, he starts at the beginning again. <br>Wherever he stops, he proceeds further.\" <br><br>Part I1 (Hadith 6 )  <br>The Arabic word (JW ('al-haal) means one who <br>reaches a halting place, and the word ($>I) <br>('al-murtahil') <br>means one who departs. In other words, as soon as a <br>reading of the Holy Qur'an is finished, one should start <br>again. And it should not be that when one reading is fin- <br>ished the other may be taken up later on. The term ($Jlj <br>('al-haal wal murtahil') is explained in a riwaayat in <br>Kanzul-Ummaal to mean (pllPSI) (al-khaatimatul miftaah) <br>ah<br>(one who concludes and opens), i.e. one who completes the <br>5 X <br>whole reading of the Holy Qur'an and then immediately <br>starts another. Probably this has led to the practice gener- <br>ally prevalent in our country, according to which the <br>reader while finishing the whole Qur'an does not stop after <br>reading the last surah but also reads from the beginning of <br>the Qur'an up to <br>Doing so has now become a mere <br>ritual and the people do not care to continue further and <br>complete the reading. This hadith teaches us that, as soon <br>as one reading of the Glorious Qur'an is completed, a fresh <br>reading should be taken up immediately and brought to <br>completion. It is written in Sharhul Ihya as well as in Alla- <br>mah Suyuti's Al-Itqan that according to Daarami whenever <br>Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) read surah an-Naas <br>(the last surah), he would also read al-Baqarah up to i,j+ <br>after which he would offer the du'a meant to be read on <br>completion of a reading of the whole Qur'an. <br>HADITH- 6 <br>Abu Musa Ash'ari (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Ra- <br>sulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"Be watch- <br>ful towards the Qur'an. I swear by Him in Whose <br>hands my life is, that the Qur'an is apt to escape from <br>the hearts more rapidly than do the camels from their <br>strings.\" <br>If a man becomes neglectful in looking after an animal, <br>and the animal frees itself from the halter, it will bolt away. <br>Similarly if the Holy Qur'an is not looked after, it will not <br>be remembered and will be forgotten. The fact that the <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>Holy Qur'an gets committed to memory is a distinct mir- <br>acle of the Book itself. Otherwise memorizing a book one- <br>half or even one-third of its size is not only difficult but <br>well-nigh impossible. Therefore, the fact that the Holy <br>Qur'an gets committed to memory is mentioned by <br>Almighty Allah as a Divine favour in surah al-Qamar, <br>where it is repeated over and over- <br>We have made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, So is <br>there any one who will remember? <br>The author of al-Jalalain writes that the interrogatory <br>clause in this ayat is in fact an imperative one. Thus <br>Almighty Allah has stressed over and over again the im- <br>portance of memorizing the Qur'an, but if we Muslims are <br>so perverse as to think that this act is useless and wasteful <br>of time and energy, this blunder on our part is sufficient to <br>justify our destruction. It is a matter of surprise indeed <br>that, when 'Uzair (Alayhis salaam) reproduced the Torah <br>from memory he was exalted to be called the \"Son of God;\" <br>poor indeed is the regard that we have for the blessing and <br>favour of Allah, that He has made the memorizing of the <br>Glorious Qur'an easy for all of us (and not only for an indi- <br>vidual as in the case of Torah). It is for such people that the <br>Qur'an says: <br>And those who dd wrong will come to know by what a <br>(Great) reverse they will be over-turned! <br>It is merely through the grace and blessing of Almighty <br>Allah that the Qur'an gets memorized, but afterwards, if a <br>person neglects it, he is made to forget it. There are severe <br>admonitions for those who forget the Glorious Qur'an after <br>having learnt it. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is <br>reported to have said, \"The sins of my ummat were shown <br>to me. I did not find any sin as great as that of forgetting the <br>Holy Qur'an after having read it. \"In another hadith it is <br>said tnat any one who forgets Qur'an after having read it, <br>will appear in the Court of Allah as a leper. According to a <br>riwaayat of Razeen (Rahmatullah alaih) in 'Jam'ul-Fa-<br>waa'id', the following ayat refer to it: <br>I* I</p></div>"

He shall say: \"My Lord, why <br>hast Thou raised me blind, and I was a seeing one <br>indeed.\" He will say, \"Even so Our Commandments <br>came to thee, but thou didst neglect them; even thus <br>shalt thou be forsaken today.\" (XX: 126-6). <br>HADITH- 7 <br>Buraidah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulullah <br>(Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said, \"He who reads the <br>Qur'an so that he might thereby get something to eat <br>from the people, shall so appear on the Day of Judge- <br>ment that his face will only be a bone, on which there <br>will be no flesh. <br>This means that those who read the Glorious Qur'an in <br>order to fulfil the needs of this world will get no share in <br>the Hereafter. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has <br>said, \"We read the Holy Qur'an. There are amongst us <br>Arabs as well as non-Arabs. Go on reading the Qur'an as <br>you do it now. Shortly, there will rise people who will set <br>right the pronunciation of letters of the Qur'an as an arrow, <br>i.e., they will work hard to adorn it and spend hours in im- <br>proving the pronunciation of each and every letter. They <br>will take great pains over phonetics. But all this will be <br>with a worldly motive. They will be the least concerned <br>with the Hereafter.\" This hadith further signifies that mere <br>recitation in a pleasing voice is of no avail if there would <br>be no sincerity and if the purpose is only to earn worldly <br>benefit. \"There will be no flesh\" means that whea a man <br>makes the noblest of all things (i.e. the Qur'an) the means <br>for earning the inferior things of this world, the noblest of <br>Virtues of the Holy Qur'an <br>all parts of the body, i.e. his face, will be deprived of its <br>beauty. <br>Once 'Imraan bin Husain (Radhiyallaho anho) hap- <br>pened to pass by a preacher who recited the Glorious <br>Qur'an and then begged of the people. He was grieved to <br>see this painful sight and recited 'Innaa lillaahi wa innaai- <br>laihi raaji-oon' (verily we are from Allah and will return to <br>Him). He said that he had heard from Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>laho alaihe wasallam) that whoever recites the Glorious <br>Qur'an should beg whatever he needs only from Almighty <br>Allah. Shortly, there will come into existence a people who <br>will recite and then beg of the people. It is reported from <br>some scholars that the \"example of one who earns the <br>gains of this world through the knowledge of deen is like <br>that of one who cleans his shoes with his cheeks; the shoes <br>will no doubt be cleaned, but the act is most stupid. It is <br>such people who are referred to in the following ayat of the <br>Glorious Qur'an: <br>These are they who buy error at the price of guidance. <br>I <br>So their ,commerce doth not prosper, neither are they <br>guided. <br>Ubayy bin Ka'b (Radhiyallaho anho) has narrated, \"I <br>taught a surah of the Glorious Qur'an to a man who gave <br>me a bow as a gift. I mentioned this to Rasulullah (Sallal- <br>II <br>laho alaihe wasallam), who said that I had accepted a bow <br>from Hell.\" A similar, incident has been mentioned about <br>himself by 'Ubaadah bin Saamit (Radhiyallaho anho) in <br>I <br>whose case Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) he <br>I <br>said, \"You have hung between your shoulders a spark from <br>Hell.\" According to another riwaayat Rasulullah (Sallal-<br>laho alaihe wasallam) had said, \"If you are prepared to put <br>, <br>a yoke of Hell round your neck, you may accept it.\" <br>r <br>Now a word for such huffaaz who are working in <br>Qur'anic schools, only for the sake of money. It is humbly <br>requested that they should give a thoughtful consideration <br>to their status and responsibility. This unbecoming con-<br>I <br>duct on their part is being attacked and made an excuse by <br>some people for stopping the reading or memorizing of the <br>Glorious Qur'an. They alone are not responsible for the evil <br>consequences, but such huffaaz also share the responsibil- <br><br>Part I1 (Hadith 7) <br>ity for stopping the teaching of the Glorious Qur'an. These <br>huffaaz think that they are engaged in the propagation of <br>the Qur'an, but in reality they are obstructing it, through <br>their misconduct and bad intentions. The ulama have not <br>permitted the acceptance of salary for teaching the Glorious 9 1 <br>Qur'an so that it becomes the primary motive. In fact, the <br>3% <br>real motive of the teachers should only be to promote the <br>D b .  <br>education and propagation of knowlegde of the Qur'an. No tQ<br>S X<br>salary can be a return for the sublime act of teaching the <br>Qur'an. Such remuneration is on1 for meeting personal <br>needs and has been permitted wKen forced by circum- <br>stances, in case of dire necessity. <br><br>FINAL NOTE <br>The purpose of describing the beauties and virtues of <br>the Holy Qur'an in the foregoing pages is to cultivate a love <br>for it. Love for the Holy Qur'an is needed for developing a <br>love for Almighty Allah, and vice versa. Love for one leads <br>to love for the other. <br>The creation of man in this world is only for the pur- <br>pose of acquiring a realization of Allah, and all other cre- <br>ation is for the sake of man. As a Persian poet says: <br>The clouds, the winds, the moon, the sun and the sky <br>are constantly at work, <br>So that $ou earn your living and do not eat in forgetful- <br>ness <br>The whole creation is involved in working for you in <br>obedience, <br>The law of justice will not be fulfilled if you fail to <br>obey (Allah). <br>So man should l6arn a lesson from their punctuality <br>and obedience ,in their functions of rendering service to <br>him. <br>Sometimes, as a warning, temporary changes are <br>caused in their functions by Almighty Allah. There is no <br>rain when it should rain; no wind blows when it should <br>blow; similar changes are wrought in the moon and the sun <br>through their eclipses. In short, everything is subject to <br>some change for admonishing those who neglect their duty <br>to their Creator. How astonishing indeed that all these <br>things be made subservient to fulful man's needs, yet their <br>obedience does not lead man to his own submission to the <br>Creator. Love alone provides the best help for obedience <br>and submission to Almighty Allah. <br>L <br>, r <br>Part 111 (Final Note) <br>Verily, the lover submits to his beloved. <br>When a person falls in love with someone, submission <br>and obedience to the beloved becomes his habit and <br>second nature. Disobedience to the beloved becomes as <br>hard as it unwilling obedience to one whom one does not <br>love. <br>One way of developing love for someone is the obser- <br>vation of his beauty and excellence. This observation may <br>be through the physical senses or through inner perception. <br>If a look at a beautiful face can lead to spontaneous love, a <br>sweet heart-captivating voice can also sometimes produce a <br>magnetic effect. A Persian poet says: <br>Looks alone do not inspire love; <br>Often this wealth is attained through charming words. <br>Sometimes it is the sweetness of voice which draws <br>the heart unconsciously and sometimes it is the beauty and <br>wisdom of expression which causes one to fall in love. Ex-<br>perienced men have suggested that in order to develop <br>love, one should dwell upon the fine attributes of the be- <br>loved, and none other than the beloved should find a place <br>in one's heart. It is true even in the case of earthly love that <br>the sight of a beautiful face cr a hand urges one to see the <br>other parts of the body of the beloved, so that love may in- <br>crease and the yearning of the heart may be satisfied, but <br>the stage of satisfaction is never reached. As an Urdu poet <br>says: <br>The disease worsened as the treatment progressed. <br>If after sowing the seeds in a field, one does not care to <br>water it, no crop will grow there. Similarly, after falling in <br>love involuntarily, if one does not pay attention to the be- <br>loved, this love will vanish in course of time. But if one</p></div>"
