Excepting a few persons who had either \n              embraced Islam or who helped him though not accepting his creed, \n              all the rest in Mecca left no stone unturned in persecuting and \n              deriding him and his followers. His uncle Abu Talib was one of those \n              good-hearted people who helped him, in spite of his not entering \n              into the fold of Islam.</p>\n            <p> The following year, on the death of Abu Talib, \n              the Qu-reysh got a free hand and therefore accelerated their sinister \n              pursuits without check and hindrance. At Taif, the second biggest \n              town of Hijaz, there lived Banu Thaqif, a clan strong in number. \n              The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) left for Taif with the \n              hope of winning them over to Islam, thus giving quarter to Muslims \n              from the persecution of the Qureysh, and also establishing a base \n              for the future propagation of Islam. On reaching Taif he visited \n              the three chieftains of the clan separately, and placed before each \n              of them the message of Allah, and called upon them to stand by his \n              Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) side. Instead of accepting \n              his message, they refused even to listen to him and, notwithstanding \n              the proverbial Arab hospitality, each of them treated him most contemptuously \n              and rudely. </p>\n            <p> They plainly told him that they did not like his \n              stay in their town. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had \n              expected a civil, even a cordial treatment and due courtesy in speech \n              from them, as they were the heads of the clan. But one of them sneered:</p>\n            <p> \"Hey, Allah has made you a Prophet!\" \n              The other exclaimed with derision:</p>\n            <p align=\"justify\"> \"Could Allah not lay His hand on anyone else, \n              beside you to make him His Prophet?\"<br>\n              The third one gibed at him:</p>\n            <blockquote> \"I do not want to talk to you, for if you are \n              in fact a Prophet, then to oppose you is to invite trouble, and \n              if you only pretend to be one, why should I talk with an impostor?\"</blockquote>\n            <p> The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), who was a rock of steadfastness \n              and perseverance, did not lose heart over this check from the chieftains, \n              and tried to approach the common people; but nobody would listen \n              to him. Instead they asked him to clear off from their own town \n              and go wherever else he liked. When he realised that further efforts \n              were in vain, he decided to leave the town. But they would not let \n              him depart in peace, and set the street urchins after him to hiss, \n              to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone him. He was so much pelted at \n              with stones that his whole body was covered with blood, and his \n              shoes were clogged to his feet. He left the town in this woeful \n              plight. When he was far out of the town, and safe from the rabble, \n              he prayed to Allah thus:</p>\n            <div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/allahumma_ilaika.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div>\n            \n            <p class=\"meaning\">\"0, my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feeble-ness of my strength, \n              of my lack of resources and my being unimportant in the eyes of \n              people. 0, Most Merciful of all those capable of showing mercy! \n              Thou art the Lord of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord. To whom \n              art Thou to entrust me; to an unsympathetic foe who would sullenly \n              frown at me, or to an alien to whom Thou hast given control over \n              my affairs? Not in the least do I care for anything except that \n              I may have Thy protection for myself. I seek shelter in Your light-the \n              light which illuminates the Heavens and dispels all sorts of darkness, \n              and which controls all affairs in this world as well as in the Hereafter. \n              May it never be that I should incur Thy wrath, or that Thou should \n              be displeased with me. I must remove the cause of Thy displeasure \n              till Thou art pleased. There is no strength nor power but through \n              Thee.\"</p>\n            <p> The Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail \n              (Alayhis salaam) appeared before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam), greeting him with Assalamu Alaikum and said:</p>\n            <blockquote> \"Allah knows all that has passed between you and \n              these people. He has deputed an angel in charge of the mountains \n              to be at your command.\"</blockquote>\n            <p> Saying this, Jibrail (Alayhis salam) ushered \n              the angel before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). The angel \n              greeted the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said:</p>\n            <blockquote> \"0, Prophet of Allah! I am at your service. If \n              you wish, I can cause the mountains overlooking this town on both \n              sides to collide with each other, so that all the people therein \n              would be crushed to death, or you may suggest any other punishment \n              for them.\"</blockquote>\n            <p> The merciful and noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam) said:</p>\n            <blockquote> \"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do \n              hope from Allah that there will be persons from among their progeny \n              who would worship Allah and serve His cause.\"</blockquote>\n            <p> Behold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam), whom we profess to follow! We get so much irritated \n              over a little trouble or a mere abuse from somebody that we keep \n              on torturing and taking our revenge throughout our lives in every \n              possible manner. Does it become people who claim to follow the magnanimous</p>\n            <p> Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)? Look, even \n              after so much suffering at the hands of the Taif mob, he neither \n              curses them nor does he work for any revenge, even when he has the \n              full opportunity to do so.</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody></table></div>"

The Qureysh \n              heard of the news and decided to resist his entry into Mecca even \n              as a pilgrim, and so he had to encamp at Hudeybiah. The devoted \n              Sahabah, 1 400 in number, were however determined to enter, even \n              if it involved an open fight; but the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam) viewed the matter differently and in spite of the Sahabah's \n              eagerness to fight, entered into a treaty with the Qureysh, accepting \n              their conditions in full. </p>\n            <p>This one-sided and seemingly ungraceful truce was a very bitter \n              pill for the Sahabah to swallow, but their devotion to the Prophet \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) would not allow them to demur, and \n              even the most valiant man like Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) \n              could not but submit to his decision. According to one of the articles \n              of the treaty, converts to Islam during the period of the truce \n              were to be returned, but not so the deserters from Muslims to Qureysh.</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) a Muslim in Mecca, was suffering \n              great persecution at the hands of Qureysh. They kept him constantly \n              in chains. On hearing about the arrival of the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) in Hudeybiah, he escaped somehow and managed to \n              reach the Muslim camp at a time when the truce was about to be signed. \n              His father, Suhail (till then a non-Muslim) was the envoy of Qureysh \n              in the negotiations for the truce. He smote Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) on his face and insisted on taking him back to Mecca. The \n              Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) represented that, since the \n              truce had not till then been written, its application in Abu Jandal's \n              case was premature. Suhail, however, would not listen to any argument \n              and was not inclined to leave his son with the Muslims even at the \n              personal request of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), and \n              would have forgone the truce even. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) \n              counting his hardships remonstrated at the top of his voice but, \n              much to the grief of the Sahabah, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam) agreed to his return. He however enjoined patience on \n              him saying:</p>\n            <p>\"Do not be distressed, Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho), \n              Allah will shortly open a way for you.\"</p>\n            <p>After the truce was signed and the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              had returned to Madinah, another Meccan Muslim Hadhrat Abu Basir \n              (Radhiyallaho anho) escaped to Madinah and besought the Prophet's \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) protection. The Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) refused to accept his implorations and, in deference \n              to the truce condition, handed him over to the two persons who had \n              been deputed by the Qureysh to claim him. He, however, advised him \n              as he had advised Hadhrat Abu Jandal (Radhiallaho anho) to be patient \n              and to hope for the help of Allah. When Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) and his escort were on their way back to Mecca, Hadhrat Abu \n              Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) said to one of them:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"Friend, your sword is extremely fine.\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>The man was flattered and took it out from the sheath and said:</p>\n            <p>\"Yes it is really very fine, and I have tried it on so many \n              persons. You can have a look at it.\"</p>\n            <p>Most foolishly he made over the sword to Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho \n              anho), who immediately 'tried' it on its owner and killed him. The \n              other man took to his heels and reached Madinah to report to the \n              Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In the meantime Abu Basir \n              (Radhiyallaho anho) also arrived. He said to the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam):</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"0, Prophet of Allah, you once returned me and \n                absolved yourself of the truce obligations. I had no obligations \n                to fulfil and I managed my escape from them by this trick, as \n                I was afraid of their forcing me to forsake my faith.\"</blockquote>\n            \n           \n              <blockquote>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: \"You \n                are a war-monger. I wish you could be helped.\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) came to understand from this \n              that he would be returned to Qureysh again when they demanded him. \n              He therefore left Madinah and fled to a place in the desert on the \n              sea shore. Abu Jandal (Radhiyallaho anho) also managed his escape \n              and joined him there. More Muslims of Mecca followed, and in a few \n              days quite a small group of such fugitives gathered in the wilderness. \n              They had to undergo untold sufferings in the desert, where there \n              was neither habitation nor vegetation. They, however, being bound \n              by no treaty proved a great nuisance for the Qureysh by dealing \n              blows after blows on their caravans passing that way. This compelled \n              the Qureysh to approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              and beseech him to intervene and call the fugitives to Madinah, \n              so that they might be bound by the terms of the treaty like other \n              Muslims, and the caravans might pass in safety. It is said that \n              Hadhrat Abu Basir (Radhiyallaho anho) was on his deathbed when the \n              letter sent by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) permitting \n              his return to Madinah reached him. He died while holding the Prophet's \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) letter in his hand.</p>\n            <p>No power on the earth can make a person forsake his faith, provided \n              it is a true faith. Moreover, Allah has given an assurance to help \n              those who are genuine Muslims.</p>\n            \n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody></table></div>"

He was an Abyssinian slave of a disbeliever in \n              Mecca. His conversion to Islam was, naturally, not liked by his \n              master and he was, therefore, persecuted mercilessly. Ummayah bin \n              Khalaf, who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie down \n              on the burning sand at midday and would place a heavy stone on his \n              breast, so that he could not even move a limb. He would then say \n              to him:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Even under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would exclaim:-</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Ahad\"-The One (Allah). \"Ahad\"-The One (Allah).</p>\n            <p>He was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, made to \n              lie on the burning ground during the day to make him either forsake \n              Islam or to die a lingering death from wounds. The torturers would \n              get tired and take turns (Abu Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie \n              with one another in afflicting more and more painful punishment, \n              but Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would not yield. At last Abu \n              Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he became a free \n              Muslim.</p>\n            <p>As Islam taught implicitly the oneness of the Almighty Creator, \n              while the idolaters of Mecca believed in many gods and goddesses \n              with minor godlings, therefore Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) repeated:</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Ahad (The One), Ahad (The One).\"</p>\n            <p>This shows his love and devotion to Allah. Allah was so dear to \n              him that no amount of persecution could distract him from reciting \n              His Holy name. It is said that the urchins of Mecca would drag him \n              in the streets, with his words \"Ahad!, Ahad!\" ringing \n              in their wake.</p>\n            <p>Look how Allah rewarded his steadfastness! He was to have the honour \n              of becoming the Prophet's moazzin. He was always to remain with \n              him at home and abroad to call out the Azaan for his Salaat. After \n              the Prophet's death it became very hard for him to continue his \n              stay in Madinah where he would miss him at every step and in every \n              corner. He therefore left Madinah, and decided to pass the rest \n              of his life striving in the path of Allah. Once he beheld the Prophet \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in his dream saying to him:</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>\"O, Bilal! How is it that you never visit me.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>No sooner did he get up than he set out for Madinah. On reaching \n              there, Hadhrat Hasan and Hadhrat Husain (Radhiyallaho anhuma) (The \n              Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) grandsons) requested him \n              to call out the Azaan. He could not refuse them, for they were very \n              dear to him. But as soon as the Azaan was called, the people of \n              Madinah cried openly out of their anguish at the memory of the happy \n              old days of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) time. Even \n              the women came out of their houses weeping. Hadhrat Bilal (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) left Madinah again after a few days and died in Damascus in \n              20 A.H. </p>\n                        </td>\n        </tr>\n        \n      </tbody></table></div>"

Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) used to say:</p>\n            <p>\"Abuzar is the custodian of such knowledge as other people \n              are incapable of acquiring.\"</p>\n            <p>When he first got news of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              mission, he deputed his brother to go to Mecca and make investigations \n              regarding 'the person' who claimed to be the recipient of Divine \n              revelation. His brother returned after necessary enquiries, and \n              informed him that he found Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              to be a man of good habits and excellent conduct, and that his wonderful \n              revelations were neither poetry nor sooth-sayings. This report did \n              not satisfy him, and he decided to set out for Mecca and find out \n              the facts for himself. On reaching Mecca, he went straight to the \n              Haram. He did not know the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              and he did not consider it advisable (under the circumstances prevailing \n              at that time) to enquire about him from anybody. When it became \n              dark, Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) noticed him and seeing in \n              him a stranger, could not ignore him, as hospitality and care for \n              the travelers, the poor and the strangers, were the Sahabah's second \n              nature. He, therefore, took him to his place. He did not ask him \n              about the purpose of his visit to Mecca, nor did Abuzar (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) himself disclose it.  day, he again went to the Haram \n              and stayed there till nightfall without being able to learn who \n              the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was. In fact everybody \n              knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and his companions \n              were being persecuted in Mecca, and Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) might \n              have had misgivings about the result of his quest for the Prophet \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) again \n              took him home for the night, but again did not have any talk with \n              him about the purpose of his visit to the city. On the third night, \n              however, after Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) had entertained him \n              as on the two  nights, he asked him:</p>\n            <p>\"Brother, what brings you to this town?\" Before replying, \n              Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) took an undertaking from Hadhrat \n              Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that he would speak the truth, and then \n              he enquired from him about Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). \n              Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) replied:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"He is verily the Prophet of Allah. You accompany \n                me tomorrow and I shall take you to him. But you have to be very \n                careful, lest people come to know of your association with me, \n                and you get into trouble. When on our way 1 apprehend some trouble, \n                I shall get aside pretending some necessity or adjusting my shoes, \n                and you will proceed ahead without stopping so that the people \n                may not connect us.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>The  day, he followed Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho), who \n              took him before the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). In the \n              very first meeting, he embraced Islam. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam), fearing that the Qureysh might harm him, enjoined upon \n              him not to make an open declaration of his Islam, and bade him to \n              go back to his clan and return when Muslims had gained the upper \n              hand. Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) replied:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"0, Prophet of Allah! By Him who is the master \n                of my soul, I must go and recite the Kalimah in the midst of these \n                unbelievers.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>True to his word, he went straight to the Haram and, right in the \n              midst of the crowd and at the pitch of his voice, recited Kalimah-e-Shahadat \n              viz:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/2-kalma.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div> \n            </div>\n            <p class=\"meaning\">\n              \" I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, and I bear \n              witness that Muhammad <br>\n              (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) is the Prophet of Allah.\"</p>\n            <p>People fell upon him from all sides, and would have beaten him \n              to death if Abbas (the Prophet's uncle, who had not till then embraced \n              Islam) had not shielded him and saved him from death.

He belongs to the Ghifar \n                clan, who live on the way of our caravans to Syria. If he is killed, \n                they will waylay us and we shall not be able to trade with that \n                country.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>This appealed to their prudence and they left him alone.</p>\n            <p>The  day, Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho] repeated his perilous \n              confession of Imaan and would have surely been beaten to death by \n              the crowd, had not Abbas intervened once again and saved him for \n              the second time.</p>\n            <p>The action of Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho anho) was due to his \n              extraordinary zeal for proclaiming Kalimah among the disbelievers, \n              and the prohibition by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              was due to the soft corner in his heart for Hadhrat Abuzar (Radhiyallaho \n              anho), lest he be put to hardships that might prove too much for \n              him. There is not the least shadow of disobedience in this episode. \n              Since the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself was undergoing \n              all sorts of hardships in spreading the message of Islam, Abuzar \n              (Radhiyallaho anho) also thought it fit to follow his example rather \n              than to avail of his permission to avoid danger. It was this spirit \n              of Sahabah that took them to the heights of material and spiritual \n              progress. When a person once recited the Kalimah and entered the \n              fold of Islam, no power on earth could turn him back and no oppression \n            or tyranny could stop him from Tabligh.</p>\n            \n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        \n      </tbody></table></div>"

They were about to start a duel when Sa'ad \n              said:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"You had better first set your own house in order. \n                Your sister and brother-in-law both have accepted Islam.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>Hearing this, Umar flew into a towering rage and turned his steps \n              towards his sister's house. The door of the house was bolted from \n              inside and both husband and wife were receiving lessons in the Qur'an \n              from Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho anho). 'Umar knocked at the door \n              and shouted for his sister to open it. Hadhrat Khabbab (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) hearing the voice of 'Umar, hid himself in some inner room, \n              forgetting to take the manuscript pages of the Holy Qur'an with \n              him. When the sister opened the door, 'Umar hit her on the head, \n              saying:</p>\n            <p>\"0, enemy of yourself. You too have renounced your religion.\"</p>\n            <p>Her head began to bleed. He then went inside and inquired, \"What \n              were you doing? And who was the stranger I heard from outside?\" \n              His brother-in-law replied, \"We were talking to each other.\" \n              'Umar said to him, \"Have you also forsaken the creed of your \n              forefathers and gone over to the new religion?\" The brother-in-law \n              replied, \"But what if the new religion be the better and the \n              true one?\" 'Umar got beside himself with rage and fell on him, \n              pulling his beard and beating him most savagely. When the sister \n              intervened, he smote her so violently on her face that it bled most \n              profusely. She was, after all, 'Umar's sister; she burst out:</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>\"'Umar! we are beaten only because we have become \n                Muslims.

He said, \"Alright show \n              me, what are these?\" \"No,\" said the sister, \"you \n              are unclean and no unclean person can touch the Scripture.\" \n              He insisted, but the sister was not prepared to allow him to touch \n              the leaves unless he washed his body. 'Umar at last gave in. He \n              washed his body and then began to read the leaves. It was Surah \n              \"Taha\". He started from the beginning of the Surah, and \n              he was a changed man altogether when he came to the verse:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/taha-14.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"meaning\"> \"Lo!

'Umar's Islam was a terrible blow \n              to the morale of the unbelievers, but still the Muslims were few \n              in number and the whole country was against them. The disbelievers \n              intensified their efforts for the complete annihilation of Muslims \n              and the extinction of Islam. With 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) on their \n              side, the Muslims now started saying their Salaat in the Haram. \n              Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p>\n        \n              \n            <blockquote>\"'Umar's Islam was a big triumph, his emigration \n              to Madinah a tremendous reinforcement, and his accession to the \n              Caliphate a great blessing for the Muslims.\"\n              \n            </blockquote>          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) at last permitted \n              them to emigrate to some other place. Abyssinia at that time was \n              ruled by a Christian King (who later on embraced Islam), famous \n              for his mercy and equity. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Mission, \n              the first group emigrated to Abyssinia. The group comprised about \n              twelve men and five women. The Qureysh pursued them to the port \n              to capture them, but their vessels had left the shore. When the \n              group reached Abyssinia, they heard the rumour that the whole tribe \n              of the Qureysh had accepted Islam. They were naturally very much \n              pleased at the news and returned to their country. On approaching \n              Mecca, they learnt that the rumour was false and the persecutions \n              were going on unabated. Some of them decided to return to Abyssinia \n              and the rest entered Mecca, seeking the protection of a few influential \n              people. This is known as the first migration to Abyssinia. Later \n              on, a bigger group of eighty-three men and eighteen women emigrated \n              to Abyssinia (separately). This is called the second emigration \n              to that country. Some Sahabah took part in both the migrations. \n              The Qureysh did not like the emigrations, and the thought of peace \n              enjoyed by the fugitives gave them no rest. They sent a delegation \n              to Abyssinia with handsome presents for the king, his courtiers \n              and the clergy. The delegation first met the chiefs and the priests \n              and, by offering them presents, succeeded in winning the court officials \n              to their side. Having thus made their way to the royal court, they \n              prostrated themselves before the king and then presenting the gifts \n              put their case before him. They said:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"0, king! A few foolish lads of our community have \n                renounced their ancestral faith, and have joined an absolutely \n                new religion, which is opposed to our as well as your religions. \n                They have come and settled in your country. The nobility of Mecca, \n                their own parents and kith and kin have sent us to take them back \n                to their country. We beseech you to make them over to us.\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>The king replied:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"We cannot make over the people who have sought \n                our shelter, without proper investigation. Let us call them to \n                our presence, and hear them out. If your charge of apostasy against \n                them is genuine, we shall make them over to you.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>The king thereupon summoned the Muslims to his court. They were \n              at first greatly distressed and did not know what to do, but Allah \n              gave them courage, and they decided to go and place the true facts \n              before the king. On appearing before him, they greeted him with \n              'Salaam'. Someone from the courtiers objected that they had not \n              prostrated before the king according to the rules of the land. They \n              explained:</p>\n            <p>\"Our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has forbidden us \n              from prostrating before any one except Allah.\"</p>\n            <p>The king then asked them to submit what defense they could make \n              to the charges brought against them. Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) \n              rose and addressed the king thus:</p>\n           \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>\"0, king! we were an ignorant people. We neither knew Allah \n                nor His Prophets A.S. We worshipped stones. We used to eat carrion \n                and commit all sorts of undesirable and disgraceful acts. We did \n                not make good our obligations to our relatives. The strong among \n                us would thrive at the expense of the weak. Till at last, Allah \n                raised a Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for our reformation. \n                His noble descent, up right conduct, integrity of purpose, and \n                pure life are only too well known amongst us. He called upon us \n                to worship Allah, and exhorted us to give up idolatry and stone-worship. \n                He enjoined upon us right conduct, and forbade us from indecency. \n                He taught us to tell the truth, to make good our trust, to have \n                regard for our kith and kin, and to do good to our neighbours. \n                From him we learnt to observe Salaat, Fasting, Zakaat and good \n                conduct; and to shun everything foul, and to avoid bloodshed.              </p>\n              <p>He forbade adultery, lewdness telling of lies, misappropriating \n                the orphan's heritage, bringing false accusations against others, \n                and all other indecent things of that sort. He taught us the Qur'an, \n                the wonderful book of Allah. So we believed in him, followed him \n                and acted up to his teachings. Thereupon our people began to persecute \n                us, and to subject us to tortures, thinking that we might abjure \n                our faith and revert to idolatry. When, however, their cruelties \n                exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country by the permission \n                of our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n           \n            <p>The king said:</p>\n            <p>\"Let us hear something of the Qur'an that your Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) has taught you.\"</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Ja'far (Radhiyallaho anho) recited a few verses from the \n              beginning of Surah \"Maryam\", which touched the hearts \n              of the king and the priestly class so much that tears flowed down \n              their cheeks and wetted their beards. The king remarked:</p>\n            <blockquote>\"By Allah, these words and the words revealed to \n                Moosa ('Alayhis Salam) are the rays of one and the same light,\" \n                and he told the Qureysh embassy that he would by no means hand \n                over the refugees to them. Then, disappointed and disgraced, they \n                held a counsel. One of them said:</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>\"I have hit upon a plan that is sure to draw the king's wrath \n              upon their heads.\"</p>\n            <p>Although the others did not agree to such a drastic step (for after \n              all they were their own flesh and blood), yet he would not listen. \n              The  day, they excited the king by telling him that those heretics \n              denounced 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam) and did not believe in his Divinity. \n              The Muslims were again summoned to the court. They were much more \n              distressed this time. When the king inquired about their belief \n              in 'Isa ('Alayhis Salam), they said:</p>\n            <blockquote>\"We believe in what Allah has revealed about him \n                to our Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), i.e. he is a servant \n                and Prophet of Allah, and is His word, which He conveyed to the \n                virgin and pure Maryam.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>Negus said: '\"Isa ('Alayhis Salam) himself does not say anything \n              beyond that.\"</p>\n            <p>The priests then began to murmur in protest, but the king would \n              not listen to them. He returned to the delegation the presents they \n              had brought for him, and said to the Muslims:</p>\n            <p>\"Go and live in peace. If anybody ill-treats you, he will \n              have to pay heavily for it.\"</p>\n            <p>A royal declaration was also issued to that effect. This enhanced \n              the prestige of the Muslims in the country, and the Qureysh delegation \n              had to return crestfallen.</p>\n            <p>This failure of the Qureysh embassy to Abyssinia, and the triumph \n              of Muslims over them, led to an increase in the exasperation of \n              the idolaters; the conversion of 'Umar (Rad-hiyallaho anho] to Islam \n              added fuel to fire. They grew more and more embittered, till things \n              came to such a pass that a large number of the Qureysh chiefs conspired \n              to kill Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) outright and deal \n              summarily with the whole affair. But this was not so easy. Banu \n              Hashim to which clan the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) belonged, \n              were strong in number and still stronger in influence. Although \n              all of them were not Muslims, yet even the non-Muslims among them \n              would not agree to, or tolerate the murder of the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam). </p>\n            <p>The Qureysh, therefore, decided to place a social ban on the Banu \n              Hashim, and their chiefs drew up a document to the effect that none \n              of them or their clans would associate with, buy from or sell to \n              those who sided with the Banu Hashim, unless and until they surrendered \n              Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the death penalty. All \n              of them signed this document on 1st Moharram of 7th year of the \n              Mission, and the scroll was hung up in the Ka'abah in order to give \n              it full sanctity. </p>\n            <p>Then, for three long years, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              was shut up with all his kinsfolk in the glen, which was a sub-section \n              of one of the gorges that run down to Mecca. For three long years, \n              nobody could see them nor could they see anybody. They could not \n              purchase anything in Mecca nor from any trader coming from outside.            </p>\n            <p>If any person was found outside this natural prison, he was beaten \n              mercilessly and if he asked for anything it was flatly refused. \n              Soon their stock of food was exhausted and they were reduced to \n              famine rations. Their women and, more specially, the children and \n              suckling babies would cry with hunger, and this was harder on them \n              than their own starvation. During the last part of this period, \n              their sole subsistence was the little food that the husbands of \n              Hashimite women married into other clans managed to smuggle into \n              the glen in the darkness of night.</p>\n            <p>At last by the Grace of Allah, after three years the scroll was \n              eaten up by white ants and the ban was removed. The severity of \n              the afflictions, which they bore during this period of ostracism, \n              cannot be imagined. But the Sahabah not only remained steadfast \n              in their faith, but also kept busy in spreading the light of Islam \n              amongst their comrades in distress.</p>\n            <p>Look! How much the Sahabah have suffered in the path of Allah and \n              for the cause of Islam. We claim to follow their footsteps, and \n              dream of the material progress and spiritual elevation which was \n              theirs, but how much have we suffered in the true cause? what sacrifice \n              have we offered for the sake of Allah in His path? Success is always \n              proportionate to the sacrifice. We wish to live in luxury and comfort, \n              and are too eager to race shoulder to shoulder with the non-Muslims \n              in enjoying the good things of this world, forgetting the Hereafter, \n              and then at the same time we expect to receive the same help from \n              Allah which the Sahabah received in their time. We cannot beguile \n              anybody but ourselves by working like this.

You eat, you drink \n                and fly under the shade of the trees, and you fear no reckoning \n                of the Day of Judgement. I wish I were just like you.\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Hadhrat Rabiah Aslami (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates:</p>\n         \n\t\t\t<br>\n              <blockquote>\"Once I had some argument with Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho \n                anho), during which he uttered a word that I did not like. He \n                realized it immediately and said to me 'Brother, please say that \n                word back to me in retaliation.' I refused to do so. He persisted, \n                and even spoke of referring the matter to the Prophet (Sallallaho \n                alaihe wasallam), but I did not agree to utter that word.

I said, \n                'Do you know who he is. He is Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho). To \n                displease him is to displease the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) \n                and to displease the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is to \n                displease Allah, and if Allah is displeased then who can save \n                Rabiah from ruin?* I went to the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) \n                and narrated the whole story to him.

He is so particular in this that he threatens to \n              have the retaliation done through the intervention of the Prophet \n              (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam). We are in the habit of saying offensive \n              words to others, but we fear neither the retaliation nor the reckoning \n              in the Hereafter.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

He put a little flour and some dates \n              and fat in the pan and began to stir. He blew (with his mouth) into \n              the fire to kindle it. Aslam says: </p>\n        \n              <blockquote>\"I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard.\"</blockquote>\n              \n            <p>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served it to \n              the family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made over to them \n              the little that was left for their  meal. The children were \n              very happy after their meal and began to play about merrily. The \n              woman felt very grateful and remarked:</p>\n            <p>\"May Allah reward you for your kindness ! In fact you deserve \n              to take the place of Khalifah instead of 'Umar.\"</p>\n            <p>'Umar consoled her and said: \"When you come to see the Khalifah, \n              you will find me there.\"</p>\n            <p>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching the \n              children. He then returned to Madinah. On his way back, he said \n              to Aslam:</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>\"Do you know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen \n                them weeping in distress; I liked to see them laughing and happy \n                for some time.\"</blockquote>\n         \n            <p>It is said that Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) while leading \n              Fajr Salaat used to recite 'Kaht, *Taha' and other such Soorahs \n              in his Salaat, and would weep so much that his crying could be heard \n              way back to several rows. Once he was reciting Surah 'Yusuf in Fajr. \n              When he came to the verse:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/yusuf-86.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p class=\"meaning\">\"I only plead for my distress and anguish unto Allah,\" \n              (XII: 86)</p>\n            <p>he wept so much that he could not recite any further. In Tahajjud, \n              he would sometimes fall to the ground and would get indisposed with \n              excessive weeping.</p>\n            <p>Such was the fear of Allah in Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) \n              whose name struck terror in the hearts of the mightiest monarchs \n              of his time.

I once led him to the Haram in Mecca, where \n              he heard a group of people exchanging hot words among themselves. \n              He asked me to lead him to them. He greeted them with 'Assalamu \n              Alaikum.' They requested him to sit down, but he refused and said: \n              'May I tell you about people whom Allah holds in high esteem? These \n              are those whom His fear has driven to absolute silence, even though \n              they are neither helpless nor dumb. Rather they are possessors of \n              eloquence and have power to speak and sense to understand. But constant \n              glorification of Allah's name has so over-powered their wits that \n              their hearts are overawed and their lips sealed. When they get established \n              in this state, they hasten towards righteousness. Whither have you \n              people deviated from this course?

If this is done, it becomes very easy \n              to perform all other acts of righteousness with full sincerity. \n              Is it so very difficult to devote a few minutes, out of the twenty \n            four hours of a day at one's disposal, to this spiritual meditation?</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

When he received the news that the Caesar (of Rome) had \n              mustered a large force to crush the power of Islam and was on his \n              way (through Syria) to invade Madinah, he decided to lead the Sahabah \n              to check him on his way. On Thursday the 5th of Rajab, 9 A.H., the \n              devoted band marched out of Madinah. As the weather was hot and \n              the fighting was expected to be very tough, the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) made an open declaration that the Muslims should \n              gather in strength and prepare fully to face the forces of the Roman \n              Empire. He also exhorted them to contribute towards the equipment \n              of the expedition. It was on this occasion that Hadhrat Abu Bakr \n              (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed all his belongings. When he was \n              questioned by the Prophet (Sal-lallaho alaihe wasallam) as to what \n              he had left for his family, he replied:</p>\n            <p>\"I have left Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              for them.\"</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) contributed half of his belongings \n              and Hadhrat 'Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) provided for the equipment \n              of one-third of the whole army. Although everybody, contributed \n              beyond his means, yet the equipment fell far short of the requirements. \n              Only one camel was available for each group of ten persons, who \n              were to ride it in turn. This is why this campaign is known as: \n              \"The campaign of hardship.\"</p>\n            <p>The journey was long and the weather hot and dry. The orchards \n              were laden with ripe dates (the staple crop of Madi-nah) and it \n              was just the time for harvesting, when all of a sudden the Sahabah \n              were required to start on this campaign. It was really an acid test \n              of their Imaan. They visualised the long and arduous journey, the \n              scorching heat, the formidable enemy opposed to them and, to top \n              all, the prospective loss of the year's crop, but they could not \n              even dream of evading the call to arms, and that solely on account \n              of the deep-rooted fear of Allah in their hearts. Except the women, \n              children (who were excusable), those who were ordered to stay behind \n              by the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself, and the munafiqin, \n              nearly everybody joined the expedition. Also among those left behind \n              were such persons as could neither arrange conveyance for themselves, \n              nor was the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) able to provide \n              them with any. It is about such people that Allah says in his Book:</p>\n\t\t\t  <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/taubah-92.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p class=\"meaning\">\"They turned back with eyes flowing with tears in sorrow that \n              they could not find means to spend.\" (IX: 92)<br>\n            </p>\n\t\t\t<p>Of the true believers, those who stayed behind without any excuse \n              whatsoever were three in number. Their story would be presently \n              related. On their way to Syria when the expedition reached the habitation \n              of Thamud, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) covered his \n              face with his shirt and quickened the pace of his camel. He also \n              instructed the Sahabah to do the same, since that was the scene \n              of Tha-mud's destruction. They were advised to pass there weeping \n              and fearing lest Allah should punish them as he had punished the \n              Thamud. </p>\n            <p>The dearest and the most beloved Prophet of Allah and his privileged \n              companions pass by the ruins of the punished people in fear and \n              tears, lest they meet the same fate; on the other hand today, if \n              any place is struck with an earthquake, it becomes a place of sightseeing \n              for us and, if we come across any ruins, our eyes remain dry and \n              our hearts unaffected.

Not only did they stay behind themselves, but they \n              induced others to do so saying:</p>\n\t\t\t  <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/TAUBAH-81-1.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p>\"Go not forth in the heat.\" </p>\n            <p>Allah's reply to this :</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/taubah-81-2.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p>\"Say the fire of Hell is of more intense heat.\"</p>\n            <p>From amongst the faithful, there were only three persons who failed \n              to rally to the Prophet's call. They were Mura-rah bin Rabi, Hilal \n              bin Umayyah and Ka'ab bin Malik (Radhiyallaho anhum). Murarah had \n              orchards of dates, laden with fruit. He persuaded himself to lag \n              behind with the plea:</p>\n            <p>\"I have taken part in all the campaigns so far. What possible \n              harm would befall the Muslims, if I miss this one?\"</p>\n            <p>He feared the loss of his entire crop in his absence, and this \n              prevented him from going out. But when he realised his folly, he \n              gave away in charity the whole crop and garden, too, that had caused \n              him to tarry behind the Prophet (Sal-lallaho alaihe wasallam). Hilal's \n              case was different. Some of his kinsfolk who had been away for a \n              long time had just returned to Madinah. It was for the sake of their \n              company that he did not join the expedition. He also had participated \n              in all the campaigns ly and thought (like Murarah) that \n              it would not matter much if he missed just that one campaign. When \n              he came to know of the seriousness of his default, he made up his \n              mind to sever all his connections with those relatives who had been \n              the cause of that blunder. Ka'ab himself gives his account in detail, \n              which is quoted in all books of Hadith. He says:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\n                <p>\"I had never been financially so well off as I was at \n                  the time of Tabuk. I had two dromedaries of my own. I had never \n                  possessed this number before. It was a habit with the Prophet \n                  (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) that he never disclosed the destination \n                  of his expeditions, but he would keep enquiring about the conditions \n                  prevailing elsewhere. </p>\n                <p>But this time in view of the distance, the hot season, and \n                  the strength of the enemy, he had declared his destination, \n                  so that preparations could be made thorough and complete. The \n                  number of the participants was so large that it was difficult \n                  to note down their names even, so much so, that absentees could \n                  hardly be detected in the large host. The gardens of Madinah \n                  were full of fruit. I intended every morning to make preparation \n                  for the journey but, somehow or other, the days passed by and \n                  I made no progress. I was satisfied that I had all the necessary \n                  means at my disposal and that I would be ready in no time if \n                  I once did decide to do so. </p>\n                <p>I was still in this state of indecision when I learnt that \n                  the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had left with his companions. \n                  The idea still lingered in my mind that I would take a day or \n                  two to get ready and overtake the party. This procrastination \n                  continued till the time for the Prophet's arrival in Tabuk drew \n                  very near. I then tried to get ready but again, somehow or other, \n                  I did not do so. Now, when I came to look at the people left \n                  behind, I realised that there was none in Madinah except those \n                  who had been condemned as Munafiqin or had been specially exempted \n                  from going for certain reasons.</p>\n                <p> The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) on reaching Tabuk \n                  inquired as well, 'How is it that I do not see Ka'ab?' Somebody \n                  said, '0, Prophet of Allah: His pride in wealth and ease has \n                  caused him to stay behind.' Ma'az interrupted and said, No, \n                  this is wrong. As far as our knowledge goes, he is a true Muslim.' \n                  The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) however, kept quiet.\"</p>\n              </blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p>\n            <blockquote>\n              <p>\"After a few days I heard the news of the Prophet's return. \n                I was struck with grief and remorse. Good excuses one after the \n                other entered my mind, and I was sure that I could escape the \n                Prophet's wrath with one of them for the time being, and later \n                on I could pray for forgiveness to Allah. I also sought advice \n                of the wise men of my family in the matter. </p>\n              <p>But when I knew that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                had actually arrived, I was convinced that nothing but the truth \n                would save me; so I decided to speak out the plain truth. </p>\n              <p>It was a habit with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                that whenever he returned from a journey he would repair to the \n                musjid, first of all, say two rakaat 'Tahiyyatui musjid' and then \n                stay there for a while to meet visitors. Now also, as he sat in \n                the musjid, the Munafiqin came and placed before him on solemn \n                oaths, their excuses for failing to accompany him on the campaign. \n                He took them at their words, leaving the rest to Allah. Just then \n                I came and greeted him with 'salaam'. </p>\n              <p>He turned his face with a sardonic smile. I besought him with \n                the words: '0, Prophet of Allah! You turn your face from me. By \n                Allah! I am neither a Munafiq, nor have I the least doubt in my \n                faith.' He asked me to draw near and I did so. </p>\n              <p>He then said to me: 'What prevented you from going out? Had you \n                not purchased the dromedaries? I made a reply: '0, Prophet of \n                Allah: If I were dealing with a worldly man, I am sure I would \n                escape his displeasure through (seemingly) reasonable excuses, \n                for Allah has endowed me with the gift of the gab. But in your \n                case I am sure that if I appease you with a false statement, Allah \n                would be displeased with me. And, on the other hand, I am sure \n                that if I displease you by confessing the simple truth, then Allah \n                would very soon blow away your displeasure. I, therefore, make \n                bold to speak the very truth. By Allah, I had no excuse at all.</p>\n              <p>I had never been so well to do as I was at that time.' The Prophet \n                (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: 'He is speaking the truth.' \n                He then said to me: 'You go away, Allah will decide about you. \n                When I left the musjid, many a man of my clan blamed me and admonished \n                me thus; 'Never before you had committed any wrong; if after making \n                some good excuse for once, you had requested the Prophet (Sallallaho \n                alaihe wasallam) to pray for your goodness, surely his prayer \n                would have sufficed you.* I inquired of them if there were any \n                more people like me. They informed me that there were two other \n                persons viz. Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rabi, who also \n                had admitted their faults like me and received the same reply \n                from the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).</p>\n              <p>I knew that both of them were very good Muslims and had participated \n                in the campaign of Badr. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] \n                issued instructions that none was to speak with the three of us.'</p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>It is a common principle that displeasure is shown where some attachment \n              exists, and a reprimand is given </p>\n            <p>when there is hope for correction. A reprimand to an incorrigible \n              person would be a futile effort.</p>\n            <p>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues:</p>\n            <blockquote>\n                <p>\"Under the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n                  wasallam), the Sahabah completely boycotted us. Nobody was prepared \n                  to mix with or even speak to us. It seemed as if I was living \n                  in a strange land altogether. My own birth-place looked like \n                  a foreign locality and my bosom friends behaved like strangers.                </p>\n                <p>'The earth, vast as it is, was straightened' (Al-Qur’an \n                  IX: 113] for me. The thing that worried me most was that, if \n                  I died in this condition, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                  would not lead my funeral prayer, and if the Prophet (Sallallaho \n                  alaihe wasallam) died in the meantime, I would be doomed for \n                  ever, with none to talk to me and with none to pray at my funeral. \n                  The other two companions of mine confined themselves to their \n                  houses. </p>\n                \n              <p>I was the most daring of the three; I would go to the market, \n                and join the Jamaat for Salaat, but nobody would talk to me. I \n                would approach the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and say \n                'Assa-lamo alaikum' and would watch eagerly to see if his lips \n                moved in reply. After Fardh, I used to complete the Salaat by \n                standing close to him, and I would look at him from the corner \n                of my eye to learn if he ever cast a single glance at me. I noticed \n                that when I was engaged in Salaat he did glance at me, but when \n                I was out of it, he would avert his face from me.\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) continues:</p>\n            \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>\"When this complete social boycott became too hard for me \n                to bear, I, one day, climbed up the wall of Qata-dah, my dear \n                cousin, and,greeted him with 'Assalamo-alaikum'. He did not return \n                my greetings. I said to him, 'For Allah's sake, do answer me one \n                question. </p>\n              <p>Do not you know that I love Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho \n                alaihe wasallam)?' He kept quiet. Again I repeated my request, \n                but again he would not speak. When I inquired for the third time, \n                he simply said, 'Allah and His Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                know best.' At this, tears welled out of my eyes and he left me \n                alone.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Once, I was passing through a street of Madinah, when I \n                noticed a Coptic Christian, who had come from Syria to sell his \n                grain, inquiring about Kaab-bin-Malik. When people pointed me \n                out to him, he came and made over a letter to me from the Christian \n                King of Ghassan. Thus it read: 'We have come to know that your \n                master has ill-treated you. Allah may not-keep you in abasement \n                and in disgrace. You had better come to us. We shall extend all \n                help to you.' When I read this letter, I uttered </p>\n              <p>\"Inna-lillahi-wa-Inna-ilaihi-raaji-oon\" </p>\n              <p>To Allah we belong and to Him is our return; </p>\n              <p>and said; 'So my state of affairs (had) reached such an ebb that \n                even the Kafirs were aspiring to draw me away from Islam.' I could \n                not imagine a calamity worse than that. I went and threw the letter \n                into an oven. Thereafter I presented myself to the Prophet (Sallallaho \n                alaihe wasallam) and exclaimed: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your indifference \n                towards me has lowered me to such an extent that even the Kafirs \n                are building up their hopes over me.\"</p>\n              <p>When forty days had passed in this condition, a messenger of \n                the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) brought me this mandate: \n                'Be separated from your wife' I inquired, 'Am I to divorce her?' \n                He replied: 'No, only be separated.</p>\n              <p>A similar message was delivered to my other two companions as \n                well. I consequently said to my wife: 'Go to your parents and \n                wait till Allah decides my case.' Hilal's wife went to the Prophet \n                (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) and said; '0, Prophet of Allah! Hilal \n                is an old man and there is nobody else to look after him. If I \n                go away from him, he will perish. If it is not very serious, kindly \n                permit me to keep attending to him.' </p>\n              <p>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) replied; 'There is no \n                harm, provided you don't indulge in cohabitation with each other.' \n                She remarked! '0, Prophet of Allah: He has no urge for such a \n                thing; since the day his ordeal has started, he has been spending \n                his entire time in weeping.\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Ka'ab (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p>\n            <p>\"It was suggested to me that I might also request the Prophet \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for permission to keep my wife with \n              me for service, but I said; 'Hilal is old, while I am young. I do \n              not know what reply I shall get and, as such, 1 have no courage \n              to make the request.</p>\n            <p>Another ten days passed and now our ordeal had lasted for a full \n              fifty days. On the morning of the fiftieth day, when I had said \n              my Tajr' prayer and was sitting on the roof of my house stricken \n              with grief, and the earth had 'straightened' for me and the life \n              had become dismal for me, I heard a crier's cry from over' the top \n              of the mount Sula; 'Happy tidings to you, 0, Kaab.' The moment I \n              heard this, I fell prostrate on the ground and tears of joy rolled \n              down my cheeks, as I understood that the ordeal was now over. In \n              fact, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had announced the \n              Divine forgiveness for all three of us after the Salaat that morning.            </p>\n            <p>At this, a person ran up the top of the mountain and yelled out \n              the cry that had reached me. Thereafter, a rider came galloping \n              to deliver the same happy news to me.</p>\n            <p>I gave away as a gift the clothes, I was wearing, to the messenger \n              of glad tidings. I swear by Allah I had no other clothes in my possession \n              at that time. I dressed up by borrowing clothes from some friend \n              and went to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). As I entered \n              the musjid, the people in the audience of the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) ran to congratulate me. Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) was the first to approach me. He shook my hand with a warmth \n              that I shall never forget. </p>\n            <p>Thereafter I offered my salutation to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam). I found his face beaming and radiant like the full moon. \n              This was usual with him at times of extreme joy. I said to him, \n              '0, Prophet of Allah! I propose to give away in charity all that \n              I possess as thanks for the acceptance of my Taubah.* He said: 'This \n              will be too much for you. Keep a portion with you.' I agreed to \n              keep my share of the booty that fell in our hands in the Khaiber \n              campaign.\"</p>\n            <p>He says:</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>\"It is the truth that brought me salvation, and \n                as such I am determined to speak nothing but the truth in future.\"</blockquote>\n          \n            <p>The above story brings out the following salient characteristics \n              of the Muslims of that time:—</p>\n          \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>(1) The importance of striving in the path of Allah. Even the \n                persons who had hitherto faithfully participated in every expedition, \n                had to bear the brunt of the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                anger when they failed to respond to Allah's call even though \n                for the first time in their lives.</p>\n              <p>(2) Their devotion and obedience to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n                wasallam). For full fifty days the whole Muslim community, even \n                their nearest and dearest, would not speak to the three persons, \n                in obedience to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam] orders. \n                The three persons themselves went most steadfastly through the \n                ordeal imposed on them.</p>\n              <p>(3) Their strong faith. Kaab was so much perturbed when he received \n                the letter from the Christian King, exciting him against the Prophet \n                (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam). His words and his action at that \n                time are a testimony to the strong faith in his heart.</p>\n            </blockquote>\n          \n            <p>Let us search our hearts and see how much devotion we have in them \n              for the observance of the duties we owe to Islam. Leaving aside \n              Zakaat and Hajj, which involve the sacrifice of money, take the \n              case of Salaat alone, which is the most important pillar of Islam \n              after Imaan. How many of us are particular about it?</p>\n           \n          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

Think of your death often. Not a single day passes when \n                the grave does not call out: 'I am a wilderness', I am a place \n                of dust, I am a place of worms'. When a Mo'min is laid in the \n                grave, it says; 'Welcome to you. It is good of you to have come \n                into me.

It then expands as far as the occupant can see. A door from \n                Paradise is opened for him in the grave and, through this door, \n                he gets the fresh and fragrant air of Paradise. But when an evil \n                man is laid in the grave it says; 'No word of welcome for you. \n                Your coming into me is very bad for you. </p>\n              <p>Of all the persons walking on the earth, I disliked you most. \n                Now that you have been made over to me, you will see how I treat \n                you!' It then closes upon him so much that his ribs of one side \n                penetrate into the ribs of the other. As many as seventy serpents \n                are then set upon him, to keep biting him till the Day of Resurrection. \n                These serpents are so venomous that if one of them happened to \n                spurt its venom upon the earth, not a single blade of grass would \n                ever grow.\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n            \n            <p>After this, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said:</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"The grave is either a garden of Paradise or a pit of Hell.\"</p>\n            <p>Fear of Allah is the basic and essential qualification of a Muslim. \n              The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) advised the believers to \n              remember death, off and on, and to keep the fear of Allah ever present \n            in their hearts.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

Our hearts became tender, our eyes were \n              flowing with tears, and we realised where we stood. I left the Prophet \n              and returned home. I sat with my wife and children and cracked jokes \n              with my wife, and I felt that the effect of the Prophet's sermon \n              had completely vanished from my heart. </p>\n            <p>Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was not what I had been, and \n              I said to myself; '0, Hanzalah! You are a Munafiq'. I was stricken \n              with grief and I left my house repeating these words in sorrow; \n              'Hanziah has turned Munafiq. </p>\n            <p>I saw Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) coming towards me and I said \n              to him; 'Hanzalah has turned Munafiq.' He said; 'Subhanallah' What \n              are you saying? Hanzalah can never be a Munafiq.</p>\n            <p>I explained to him: 'When we are with the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam) and listen to his discourses about Paradise and Hell, \n              we feel as if both are present before our very eyes but when we \n              return home and are absorbed in our domestic and family affairs, \n              we forget all about the Hereafter.

He inquired about \n              the matter, and I repeated what I had said to Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho \n              anho). Thereupon the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) remarked: \n              'By Him Who controls my life, if you could keep up for all times \n              the fervor aroused in you when you are with me, angels would greet \n              you in your walks and in your beds.

According to what has been said by \n              the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), complete absorption in \n              the Hereafter is rare, and it should not be expected by all. It \n              is only for the angels to remain in the same state for ever. </p>\n            <p>In case of men, the state of their mind changes with circumstances \n              and environments.

I don't know whether I shall \n                be able to cross over or fall into Hell'*.</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Zurarah bin Aufa was leading the Salaat in a Musjid.

During his Qiraat, when he reached \n              the verse:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/anqaboot-57.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p class=\"meaning\">\n              \"Every soul will taste of death\" (III: 185)</p>\n            <p>he began to repeat it again and again. He heard a voice from a \n              corner of the room saying:</p>\n            <p>\"How often are you going to repeat this verse?

One of them would be the person \n              who remembered Allah when all alone by himself, and tears flowed \n              from his eyes with awe of Allah and in repentance for his sins.</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>Hadhrat Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</blockquote>\n         \n            <p>\"One who can weep should do so, and one who cannot should \n              make the appearance of a weeping person.\"</p>\n            <p>It is reported of Muhammad bin Munkadir (Radhiyallaho anho) that, \n              when he wept, he smeared his tears over his face and beard saying:</p>\n            <p>\"I have heard that the fire of Hell does not touch the place \n              touched by these tears.\"<br>\n              Thabit Banani was suffering from a disease of the eyes. His doctor \n              said to him:</p>\n            <p>\"Your eyes would be all right, provided you do not weep in \n              future.\"</p>\n            <p>He replied: \"What is the good of an eye if it cannot shed \n              tears.\"</p>\n         \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>Yazid bin Maisarah (Rahmatullah alaih) says:</p>\n              <p>'There can be seven reasons for weeping viz., extreme joy, insanity, \n                extreme pain, horror, artifice, intoxication and fear of Allah. \n                A single tear shed in the fear of Allah is sufficient to quench \n                oceans of fire (of Hell).\"</p>\n              <p>Hadhrat Ka'ab Ahbar (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p>\n              <p>\"By Him who holds my life in His (hands), I love to weep \n                for fear of Allah, with tears flowing down my cheeks, rather than \n                spend a mountain of gold in charity\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n            \n            <p>There are numerous other sayings of the Saints and other pious \n              people, indicating that weeping because of the fear of Allah, and \n              over one's sins, is very effective and beneficial in attaining spiritual \n              elevation. We should not, however, lose hope in Allah. His Mercy \n              is all-embracing. Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho] says:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"If it be announced on the Day'of Judgement that \n                all except one individual shall go to Hell, my expectation of \n                the Mercy of Allah would make me hope that I may be that chosen \n                one. Again, if it be announced on that day that all except one \n                individual shall go to Paradise, then my sins would make me fear \n                that I may be that condemned one.\"</blockquote>\n        \n            <p>It is therefore necessary that we should combine fear and hope \n              together in our hearts. Especially when the time of death is approaching, \n              we should have more hope than fear. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam) says:</p>\n            <p>\"None of you should die, except with a strong hope in the \n              Mercy of Allah.\"</p>\n            <p>When Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Radhiyallaho anho) approached his \n              end, he sent for his son and asked him to read to him the Ahaadith \n              that induce hope in Allah and His Mercy.</p>\n        \n            \n          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

The Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) Life of Abstinence</h2>\n            <p>Once, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) decided to stay \n              away from his wives for one month, as he was displeased with them \n              on some account. He lived for that one month in a separate room \n              in the upper story. A rumor that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam) had divorced his wives got afloat among the Sahabah. When \n              'U mar heard of this, he came running to the musjid and found the \n              Sahabah sitting in groups, struck with grief over the Prophet's \n              suffering. He went to his daughter Hafsah (Radhiyallaho anha), who \n              was a wife of the Prophet, and found her weeping in her room. He \n              said to her:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"Why are you weeping now? Have I not been warning \n                you all these times to refrain from any act likely to cause the \n                Prophet's displeasure?\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>He returned to the musjid and found some of the Sahabah sitting \n              near the pulpit and weeping. He sat there for some time, but could \n              not sit for long due to his excessive grief. He went towards the \n              room where the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was staying.            </p>\n            <p>He found Rabah (Radhiyal-laho anho), a slave, sitting on the steps. \n              He asked him to go and inquire of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam] if he could allow 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) to see him. \n              Rabah went inside and came back to inform him that the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) held his peace and said nothing. 'Umar (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) returned to the musjid and sat near the pulpit. </p>\n            <p>Again the anguish eating his heart would not allow him any rest, \n              and he requested Rabah to convey his request to the Prophet a second \n              time. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) did not make any \n              answer this time too. After tarrying near the pulpit for some time \n              more, 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) craved permission to see the Prophet \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) for the third time.</p>\n            <p>This time, his request was acceded to. When he was ushered in, \n              he saw the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) lying on a date \n              leaf matting. The crossed pattern of the matting could easily be \n              seen imprinted on his handsome body. He had a leather bag filled \n              with the bark of the datepalm as his pillow.</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat 'Umar (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p>\n            \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>\"I greeted him with Assalamo alaikum and inquired: 'Have \n                you divorced your wives, 0, Prophet of Allah?\" He answered \n                in the negative. Much relieved, then I made bold to remark, a \n                bit amusingly; '0, Prophet of Allah! we the Qureysh have always \n                been having the upper hand over our women, but in case of the \n                Ansar of Madinah, it is the women who have the upper hand. Our \n                women have also got influenced by the women over here'. </p>\n              <p>I said a few more similar things which made him smile. I noticed \n                that the contents of his room consisted of only three pieces of \n                tanned skin and a handful of barley lying in a corner. I looked \n                about, but I failed to find anything else. I began to weep. </p>\n              <p>He said; 'Why are you weeping?' I replied: '0, Prophet of Allah! \n                why should I not weep? I can see the mat's pattern imprinted on \n                your body, and I am also beholding all that you have got in this \n                room. 0, Prophet of Allah! Pray that Allah may grant ample provisions \n                for us.</p>\n              <p>The Persians and the Romans who have no true faith and who worship \n                not Allah but their kings—Caesar and Chosroes-presently \n                live in gardens with streams running in their midst, but the chosen \n                Prophet and the accepted slave of Allah does live in such a dire \n                poverty!' The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was resting \n                against his pillow, but when he heard me talk like this, he sat \n                up and said; '0, 'Umar! are you still in doubt about this matter? \n                Ease and comfort in the Hereafter are much better than ease and \n                comfort in this world. </p>\n              <p>The unbelievers are enjoying their share of the good things in \n                this very world, whereas we have all such things in store for \n                us in the .

I replied: 'The same canvas, \n                but I had four-folded it instead of the customary double fold.' \n                He said: 'Keep it as it was before.

'Utbah \n              (Radhiyallaho anho) started eating, but the bread was so coarse \n              that he could not swallow it.

On account of spasms of hunger, I would lie on my \n                belly and press my stomach against the ground or keep a stone \n                tied to my abdomen. </p>\n              <p>Once, I intentionally sat in wait for some notable people to \n                pass that way.

But his answer was brief, and my plan \n                did not work.</p>\n              <p>The same thing happened with Hadhrat Umar, (Radhiyallaho anho) \n                when he chanced that way.

He \n                asked, 'Who brought this milk?\" and was told that somebody \n                had sent it as a present. He bade me to go and invite all the \n                Suffah friends. The Suffah people were treated as everyone's guests \n                by all the Muslims.

But at this particular juncture, \n                they mustered seventy in all.

Also, I was aware that the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n                wasallam) would ask myself to serve the milk to the others first, \n                and a server is always the last and, more often than not, gets \n                the least of the lot.

'Quite so', I replied. 'Then take \n                it,' he said. I needed no second bidding, and took enough. He \n                exhorted me to have more, and I had my fill; till I declared that \n                I had no room for any more.

He gave them \n              a bag full of dates for their rations.

That \n              is why association with bad people is always discouraged. Even the \n              company of animals is not without its own effect.

But when he was informed \n              of the time of Salaat, he would perform it in that very condition, \n              and say:</p>\n            <p>\"There is no portion in Islam for the person who discards \n              Salaat.\"</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Uthman (Radhiyallaho anho) would remain in Salaat all night \n              long, finishing the whole of the Qur'an in one rakaat.</p>\n            <p>It is reported about Hadhrat Ali (Radhiyallaho anho) that he would \n              turn pale and tremble at the time of Salaat. Somebody asked him \n              the reason, and he said:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"It is the time to discharge that trust which Allah \n                offered to the Heavens and the Earth and the hills, but they shrank \n                from bearing it, and I have assumed it.\"</blockquote>\n  \n            <p>Somebody asked Khalaf-bin-Ayub: \"Do not the flies annoy you \n              in your Salaat?\"</p>\n            <p>His answer was:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"Even the sinful persons patiently bear the lashes \n                of the government, to boast of their endurance afterwards. Why \n                should I be made to skip about by mere flies when standing in \n                the presence of my Lord?\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>Muslim bin Yasaar when he stood up for Salaat, said to members \n              of his family:</p>\n            <p>\"You may keep on talking, I shall not be knowing what you \n              talk.\"</p>\n            <p>Once he was saying his Salaat in the Jaami' musjid of Basrah. A \n              portion of the musjid wall fell down with a crash; and every body \n              ran pell mell for safety, but he never even heard the noise.</p>\n            <p>Somebody asked Haatim Asam as to how did he say his Salaat.</p>\n            <p>He replied:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\n                <p>\"When the time for Salaat comes, I perform my Wudhu and \n                  go to the place where I have to say my Salaat. I sit down for \n                  some time, till all the parts of my body are relaxed. Then I \n                  stand up for Salaat, visualising the Ka'bah in front of me, \n                  imagining my feet upon the Bridge of Siraat, with Paradise to \n                  my right, and Hell to my left, and Izraa-eel close behind me, \n                  and thinking that it may be my last Salaat. Then I say my Salaat \n                  with full sincerity and devotion. </p>\n                <p>And I finish my Salaat between fear and hope about its acceptance.</p>\n                \n            </blockquote>            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

Both of them were posted to watch from a hill-top \n              against any possible night attack by the enemy.</p>\n            <p>Abbaad (Radhiyallahu anho) said to Ammar (Radhiyal-lahu anho):</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>\"Let us keep watch and sleep turn by turn.

But an enemy \n              scout made him out in the dark from a distance, and let fly an arrow \n              at him. Seeing that he made no movement, he shot another and still \n              another arrow at him. Hadhrat Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) drew out \n              and threw away each arrow as it struck him, and at last awakened \n              his companion. The enemy fled when he saw them both together, fearing \n              that there might be many more of them. Hadhrat Ammar (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) noticed Abbaad (Radhiyallaho anho) bleeding from three places. \n              He said:</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Subhanallah! why did you not awake me earlier?\"</p>\n            <p>Abbaad replied:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>I had started\"reciting Surah 'Kahf in my Salaat. \n                I did not like to cut it short, but when I was struck by the third \n                arrow, I was greatly concerned that my death might jeopardise \n                the safety of the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).

For a \n              short moment, he followed the bird with his eyes, and forgot the \n              number of his rakaat. Upon this mishap, his sorrow knew no bounds. \n              He repaired to the Prophet's (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) presence \n              straightway and submitted thus:</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>\"0 Prophet of Allah, this garden of mine has been \n                the cause of a diversion in my Salaat. I give it away in the cause \n                of Allah. Kindly spend it as may appear proper to you.\"</blockquote>\n         \n            <p>A similar chance befell one of the Ansaar in the time of Hadhrat \n              Usman (Radhiyallaho anho). He was saying his Salaat in his garden. \n              The branches of the trees were weighed down with ripe juicy dates, \n              luxurious abundance, which caught his eyes, and he felt pleased \n              with it. This made him forget the number of his rakaat. He was so \n              much stricken with grief that he decided to part with the garden \n              that had distracted him from his Salaat. </p>\n            <p>He approached Usman (Radhiyallaho anho) and made over the garden \n              to him for utilising it in the path of Allah. Usman (Radhiyal-laho \n              anho) had the garden sold for fifty thousand dirhams and spent the \n              money as desired. This shows the value the Sahaba set on their faith; \n              and Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaho anho) could give away his orchard \n              worth fifty thousand dirhams because it had interfered with his \n              Salaat.

A woman slave of Hujair (who later embraced \n              Islam) says:</p>\n          \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>\"When Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) was in captivity \n                with us, I noticed one day that he was eating grapes from a bunch \n                as big as a human head, though it was not the season of grapes \n                in Mecca at that time. When the day for his execution drew near, \n                he asked for a razor, which was handed over to him. Meanwhile \n                a child of the house, in his play, went close to Hadhrat Khubaib \n                (Radhiyallaho anho). </p>\n              <p>All the inmates of the house got alarmed at the sight. Hadhrat \n                Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) having been marked for death, they \n                thought there was nothing to prevent him from killing the child \n                with the razor. But to remove their fears on observing their alarm, \n                Hadhrat Khubaib (Radhiyallaho anho) remarked: 'Do you think that \n                I would stoop to the killing of an innocent child? This heinous \n                crime is simply not possible for me.'\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n           \n            <p>When he was brought to the gallows, and asked to make his last \n              wish, if any, he requested:</p>\n            <p>\"Allow me to say two rakaat of Salaat, for it is time for \n              me to leave the world and meet my Allah.\"</p>\n            <p>They let him say his Salaat. On finishing the two rakaat most calmly, \n              he said:</p>\n            <p>\"But for your thinking that I was afraid of death, I would \n              have said another two rakaats.\"</p>\n            <p>He was then tied to the gallows. At that time he said:</p>\n            <p>\"0, Allah! There is nobody to convey my last Salaam to Thy \n              Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\"</p>\n            <p>And Allah sent his Salaam to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              through an angel. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) answered:</p>\n         \n              <blockquote>\"Wa alaikumus salaam! 0 Khubaib,\" and observed \n                to the Sahabah: ^Khubaib has been martyred by the Qureysh.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>At the gallows, forty of the Querysh speared him simultaneously. \n              One of those teased him:</p>\n         \n              <blockquote>Say by Allah, if you now wish Muhammad (Sallallaho alaihe \n                wasallam) to be in your place and you to be let off.\"</blockquote>\n           \n            <blockquote>He replied: \"By Allah the Most Magnificent, I will \n                not tolerate a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                in ransom for my life.\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>Every word of this story is a lesson for us all. The devotion and \n              love of the Sahabah narrated therein is really something to esteem \n              and covet. They would lay down their very lives, but they would \n              not tolerate even a thorn pricking the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n              wasallam). Again, look at Hadhrat Khubaib's (Radhiyallaho anho) \n              last wish. </p>\n            <p>He neither remembers his family members nor wishes to see any of \n              them; what he wishes is to send his last Salaam to the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) and to say two last rakaats of Salaat.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

I went to a person there, and asked about \n                the details of his possessions. A baby camel one year old was \n                due from him in Zakaat. When he heard this, he exclaimed, 'Of \n                what use is a baby camel, one year old? You can neither milk it, \n                nor ride it. Here is a fine grown-up she-camel. You had better \n                take this instead.</p>\n              <p>I replied, 'My commission does not permit me to take more than \n                what is actually due from you. I, therefore, cannot accept what \n                you offer. The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is visiting \n                this locality, and tonight he will be camping at a place not very \n                far from here.</p>\n              <p>It is better you should go and place your offer before him. If \n                he does not object, I would gladly accept your offer, otherwise \n                you shall have to give me exactly what is due from you.' Thereupon, \n                he took the she-camel to the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n                and besought him thus: '0, Prophet of Allah! Your deputy came \n                to receive Zakaat from me.

I therefore placed everything \n                that I possessed before him. </p>\n              <p>He decided that a baby camel one year old was due from me. Now, \n                0, Prophet of Allah! This baby camel is of no use. It can neither \n                yield milk nor carry a load. I, therefore, pressed him to accept \n                a fine grown-up she-camel in-stead; which he refused to accept \n                without your permission. I have now come to you with the she-camel.</p>\n              <p>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) observed, No doubt only \n                that much is due from you which he has worked out, but if you \n                are willing to give more than that, of your own accord, it would \n                be accepted.' I then presented the she-camel to the Prophet (Sallallaho \n                alaihe wasallam), which he accordingly accepted and sought Allah's \n                blessings for the donor.\"</p>\n            </blockquote>\n         \n            <p>Look, with what magnanimity of heart the Sahabah parted with their \n              best things for the sake of Allah. On the other hand, we too claim \n              to be the true followers of Islam, and ardent devotees of the Prophet \n              (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) but, leaving apart the bestowing of \n              alms in general to the poor and the needy, we are most reluctant \n              to pay the actual obligatory dues.

Alas, \n                before I could approach him, he had breathed his last. I made \n                all haste back to Hishaam and found him dead as well.

Thus the greatest reward would be for him who learns the \n              Holy Qur'an and thereafter teaches it to others. But in some of \n              the books this 'hadith's is narrated with the word 'or', in which \n              case the meaning would be: \"The best amongst you is he who \n              learns the Qur'an or-teaches it.\"</p>\n            <p>According to this version, the reward is general, i.e., equally \n              great whether one learns himself or teaches to others. <br>\n              Thus there would be equal virtue for both.</p>\n            <p>The Qur'an is the basis of the religion of Islam, and on the preservation \n              and propagation of the Qur'an depends the very existence of this \n              faith. Hence the virtue of learning and teaching the Qur'an is self-evident \n              and does not need further elucidation.</p>\n            <p>There are, however, various degrees of excellence. The highest \n              is to learn the Qur'an along with its meanings and purport, and \n              the least is to learn its words only.</p>\n            <p>The hadith mentioned above is supported also by another saying \n              of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) as reported by Hadhrat \n              Sa'eed ibn Saleem (Radhiyallaho anho): \"If a person who has \n              acquired knowledge of the Holy Qur'an considers another person who \n              has been gifted with something else to be more fortunate than himself, \n              he has shown disrespect to the blessings of Allah bestowed on him \n              on account of his learning the Qur'an.\" It is evident that \n              since the Qur'an, being the Word of Allah, is superior to all other \n              discourses as mentioned in some of the Ahadith quoted later, its \n              reading and teaching must be superior to everything else.</p>\n            <p>Mulla Alt Qari quotes from another hadith that whoever acquires \n              the knowledge of Holy Qur'an stores the knowledge of Prophethood \n              in his forehead.</p>\n            <p>Sahl Tastari (Rahmatullah alaih) says that the proof of love for \n              Allah is the existence of love for the Word of Allah in one's heart.</p>\n            <p>In 'Sharhul Ihya, the list of people who will be given shelter \n              in the shade of the Arsh (Throne of Allah) on the fearful Day of \n              Judgment includes those persons who teach the Qur'an to the children \n              of Muslims and also those who learn the Holy Qur'an in their childhood \n            and are devoted to its recitation when grown up.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

We replied that everyone of us would \n                love to do so. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) then said \n                that going to the musjid and reciting or teaching two ayaat of \n                the Qur'an is more precious than two she-camels, three ayaat are \n                most precious than three she-camels, and that similarly reciting \n                or teaching of four ayaat is better than four she-camels and an \n                equal number of camels.</blockquote>\n          \n            <p>\"Suffah\" is the name of a particular raised platform \n              in the Mosque of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in \n              Medina. It used to be occupied by the poor Muslim muhajirin (Plural \n              of muhajir-emigrant from Mecca to Medina) who are known as \"Ashab-us-Suffah\" \n              (Men of Suffah). The number of these men varied from time to time: \n              'Allamah Suyuti (Rahmatullah alaih) has listed one hundred and one \n              names and also written an independent booklet about their names.</p>\n            <p>But-han and Aqeeq were the two market-places for camels near Medina. \n              The camel, more particularly a she-camel having a fat hump, was \n              a favourite of the Arabs.</p>\n            <p>The expression \"without sin\" is significant. A thing \n              can be acquired without labour either by extortion, through illegal \n              inheritance (by forcefully taking over the property of some relative) \n              or by theft. Rasullullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) thus ruled \n              out all such acquisitions. Acquiring a thing without any sin is \n              certainly preferred by all, but much more valuable is the learning \n              of a few ayaat.</p>\n            <p>It is a clear fact that let alone one or two camels, even if one \n              acquires the kingdom of all the seven continents one will be forced \n              to leave it, if not today surely tomorrow (at the time of death), \n              but the reward of one ayat will be everlasting. We see even in this \n              life that a man feels happier when he is given only one rupee (without \n              the condition of returning it), rather than if he is given one thousand \n              rupees for keeping in his safe custody for a while only. In the \n              latter case, he is merely burdened with a trust without getting \n              any benefit out of it. </p>\n            <p>In fact, this Hadith implies an admonition not to compare something \n              temporary with something eternal. Whether in action or at rest, \n              a man should consider if his efforts are being wasted on acquiring \n              the temporary gains of this world, or, are directed towards achieving \n              the everlasting ones. Woe be to the waste of effort for which we \n              earn eternal misery. </p>\n            <p>The last phrase of the Hadith \"superior to an equal number \n              of camels\" contains three meanings. First, up to the number \n              four, the reward has been mentioned in detail. Beyond this, it is \n              briefly mentioned that the more ayaat a person acquires, the greater \n              will be their superiority over the number of camels. In this case, \n              the word \"camels\" at the end refers to the species—either \n              he-camels or she-camels—and the number implied is more than \n              four because, up to the number four, the reward has been mentioned \n              in detail. </p>\n            <p>The second meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as \n              referred to earlier, the significance being that inclinations are \n              always different; some are fond of she-camels, others prefer a he-camel. \n              Therefore Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has used this \n              expression to signify that every ayat is superior to a she-camel, \n              and if one prefers a he-camel, an ayat is also superior to a he-camel. \n              The third meaning is that the numbers mentioned are the same as \n              referred to before and not more than four. </p>\n            <p>According to the second meaning, the explanation that an ayat is \n              superior to a she-camel or he-camel does not hold good, but it implies \n              a collection, i.e., one ayat is superior to a he-camel and a she-camel \n              considered together, and likewise every ayat is superior to the \n              combination of an equal number of he-camels or she-camels. Thus \n              a single ayat has been compared to a pair or couple (of camels). \n              My late father (May Allah bless his grave with Divine light) has \n              preferred the latter interpretation because it points to a superior \n              virtue. </p>\n            <p>This however, does not mean that the reward of an ayat can be equaled \n              to a camel or two camels. All this is for inducement and illustration. \n              It has been clearly written before that an ayat whose reward is \n              permanent and enduring is superior and preferable even to a kingdom \n              over the seven continents, which is bound to disintegrate.</p>\n            <p>Mulla 'Alt Qari has written an account of a pious Shaikh who went \n              to Mecca for Haj] on the 9th day of Dhul Hijjah—the 12th month \n              of the Islamic calendar. When he landed at Jiddah, some of his friends \n              in business requested him to prolong his stay in Jiddah, so that \n              they could earn more profit for their merchandise by virtue of his \n              blessed presence. In fact they wanted that some of the servants \n              of the Shaikh be benefited by the profits of their business. </p>\n            <p>At first the Shaikh expressed his inability to prolong his stay, \n              but when they insisted the Shaikh asked them as to the maximum profit \n              that they would earn for their goods. They explained that the profit \n              was not the same in all cases; but the maximum that they could expect \n              was hundred per cent. </p>\n            <p>The Shaikh said, \"You have taken all this trouble for such \n              a petty gain; for such an insignificant gain. I cannot miss the \n              salaat in the respected Haram (the most Sacred Mosque), where the \n              reward of salaat gets multiplied one hundred thousand times.*' In \n              fact, we Muslims should consider how, for petty worldly gains, we \n              sometimes sacrifice great spiritual benefits.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

It is highly \n              praiseworthy if one masters its meaning and significance as well. \n              \"To be with the angels\" means that, like the angels who \n              transferred the Qur'an from the, Lowhul Mahfooz' (Protected Tablet \n              in the Heavens), he also conveys it to others through its recitation \n              and, therefore, both have the same occupation; or that he will join \n              the company of such angels on the Day of Judgment. One who falters \n              will get double reward—one for his reading and the other for \n              his effort in reading the Qur'an, in spite of faltering again and \n              again. </p>\n            <p>It does not mean that his reward will exceed that of a well-versed \n              person. The reward that is mentioned for a well-versed person is \n              far greater, so much so that he will be in the company of special \n              angels. The explanation is that the labour involved in faltering \n              and the difficulties in the reading of the Qur'an carry an independent \n              reward. As such, reading of the Qur'an should not be given up, even \n              though faltering may be an excuse.</p>\n            <p>Mulla 'Ali Qari has reproduced from the riwayat of Ta-brani and \n              Baihaqi that one who cannot memorize the Qur'an well and yet persists \n              in learning it by heart gets double reward. Similarly, one who cherishes \n              a longing for memorizing it and does not possess the ability to \n              do so, but does not give up his efforts, will be reckoned by Almighty \n              Allah among the huffaaz (Plural of hafiz—one who has learnt \n              the whole Qur'an by heart) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

The Kali-mah is the central support \n              and the other four pillars of Islam are, so to say, the remaining \n              four supports, one at each corner of the canopy. Without the central \n              support, the canopy cannot possibly stand, and if any one of the \n              corner supports is missing a collapse will result in the defective \n              corner. Now, let us judge for ourselves how far we have kept up \n              the canopy of Islam. Is there really any pillar that is being held \n              in its proper place?</p>\n            <p>The five pillars of Islam mentioned in this Hadith signify the \n              most essential duties of a Muslim. Although a Muslim cannot do without \n              any one of them, yet salaat in Islam occupies a position  only \n              to Imaan. Hadhrat Abdullah bin Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anho) says:</p>\n            <p>\"Once, I inquired of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), \n              which act (of man) was the dearest to Allah. The Prophet replied, \n              'salaat'. I then inquired which act came  (in order of merit) \n              and the Prophet replied, 'Kindness to parents'. I again asked what \n              was  and he answered 'Jihaad'.\"</p>\n            <p>Mulla Ali Qari (Rahmatullah alaih) has quoted this Hadith in support \n              of the belief that salaat is the most important religious duty after \n              Imaan. This is further corroborated by a hadith, in which the Holy \n              Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) is reported to have said:</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\"> \"Salaat is the best of all that has been ordained by Allah.\"</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

He caught \n              hold of a dry branch of the tree and shook it till all its leaves \n              fell off. He then said to me, \"0, Abu Uthman! (Radhiyallaho \n              anho) Will you not ask me why I am doing this?\" \"Do tell \n              me,\" I entreated. He said, \"The Apostle of Allah had done \n              exactly like this before me, while I was with him under a tree.            </p>\n            <p>He caught a dry branch of it and shook it, till all its leaves \n              fell off\".

He remarked: \"Verily when a Muslim \n              takes wudhu properly and then observes his salaat five times a day, \n              his sins fall off just as these leaves have fallen off. He then \n              recited the following verse of the Holy Qur'an:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"Establish salaat at the two ends of the day, and \n                at the approaches of the night. Verily, good deeds annul ill deeds. \n                This is a reminder for the mindful. (XI: 114)\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>The behaviour of Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) in the above \n              Hadith displays the profound love which the Sahaabah had for the \n              Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe</p>\n            \n            <p>wasallam). They would often cherish the sweet memories of the time \n              when the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was living among them. \n              They would, while quoting him, enact exactly what they had seen \n              him doing at a particular moment.</p>\n            <p>It is really very difficult to cover all the traditions of the \n              Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), which deal with the importance \n              of salaat and which declare forgiveness for those who guard it. \n              As had already been said before, the theologians restrict this declaration \n              of forgiveness to saghaa'ir (minor sins) only, but in the text of \n              the Hadith there is no such restriction. </p>\n            <p>My learned father gave me two reasons for this. Firstly, it does \n              not really become a Muslim to commit any of the kabaa'ir (major \n              sins). If perchance any such sins are committed by him, he cannot \n              rest in peace (due to inherent fear of Allah in him) until he washes \n              them with his tears of repentance in crying before Allah. Secondly, \n              the person who performs his salaat with sincerity and thoroughness \n              is very likely to do istighfaar quite a number of times daily. Look \n              for instance at the closing prayer of salaat itself, viz:</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"0, My Lord! I have wronged my soul a great wrong, \n                and none forgiveth sins save Thou alone. Then forgive me and have \n                mercy on me. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>In the above Hadith, mention is made of wudhu to be done properly. \n              We should, therefore, be sure of the regulations about wudhu and \n              try to observe all of these. For example, take the case of miswaak. \n              It is sunnat of wudhu, but is very often neglected. It is said in \n              a Hadith that the salaat offered after doing miswaak is seventy \n              times superior to the salaat without miswaak. In another Hadith, \n              use of miswaak has been enjoined very strongly, and the following \n              benefits are attributed to it:—</p>\n            <p>\"It cleanses and sweetens the mouth and checks its bad smell.\"</p>\n            <p>\"It is a cause of Allah's pleasure and a blow to the Devil.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Allah and his angels love the person doing miswaak.\" \n              \"It strengthens the gums and improves eye-sight.\"</p>\n          \n              <blockquote>\"It is a purge against bile and phlegm.\"</blockquote>\n          \n            <p>To crown all, \"It is a sunnah i.e. the practice of our beloved \n              Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).\"</p>\n            <p>As many as seventy virtues of the miswaak have been enumerated \n              by the theologians. It is said that a person in the habit of miswaak \n              dies with the Kalimah on his lips. The rewards of taking wudhu properly \n              are very many. It is mentioned in Ahaadith that the parts of body \n              washed in wudhu shall glitter on the Day of Judgment and, by this \n              (distinction), the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) will at \n              once recognise his followers.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

'No', replied the \n              companions, 'No dirt can remain on his body.' The Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam) remarked: So, exactly similar is the effect of \n              salaat offered five times a day. With the Grace of Allah, it washes \n              away all the sins'.\"</p>\n            <h2>HADITH - 4(b) </h2>\n            <p>\"Hadhrat Jaabir (Radhiyallaho anho) narrates that he heard \n              the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) saying:</p>\n        \n              <blockquote>\"The likeness of five times daily salaat is as \n                the likeness of a deep brook running in front of the door of a \n                person who bathes therein five times a day.\"</blockquote>\n          \n            <p>Running water is generally free from dirt, and the deeper it runs \n              the cleaner and purer it is. A bath in such water surely removes \n              dirt from the body and makes it clean. Salaat offered with due regard \n              for its essentials likewise cleanses the soul of all sins. There \n              are several Ahaadith of the same meaning, though with slight variations \n              in expression, narrated by different companions of the Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam). Hadhrat Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho] \n              narrates that he heard the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              saying:</p>\n           \n              <blockquote>'Each of the five salaats expiates the sins committed \n                since the salaat preceding it. To explain, let us take the case \n                of a person working in a factory. His job is such that his body \n                gets covered with dust. But there are five streams of running \n                water in between the factory and his house and, on his return \n                from the job, he takes a bath in each stream. The effect of five \n                times daily salaat is quite similar. Any sins of omission and \n                commission between two salaats are forgiven on account of 'istighfaar \n                and taubah in each salaat.'</blockquote>\n         \n            <p>The Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) through such parables, \n              aims at impressing that salaat has the wonderful power of removing \n              the sins. If we fail to avail of Allah's mercy, surely we ourselves \n              are the losers.</p>\n            <p>To err is human. We are likely to commit innumerable acts of displeasing \n              Allah and deserve thereby. His wrath and punishment, but look how \n              relenting our dear Allah is! He has most graciously shown us the \n              way to earn His mercy and forgiveness. It is a great pity if we \n              do not avail of this great favour. Our Allah is always eager to \n              show us His mercy on very small grounds. It is said in a Hadith, \n              that if a person goes to bed with the intention of getting up for \n              Ta-hajjud and perchance does not wake up, he receives the full reward \n              for Tahajjud, although he has been enjoying his sleep at the time \n              of Tahajjud. How boundless is the grace of Allah and what a tremendous \n              loss and deprivation if we do not receive blessings from such a \n              Giver.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

The first \n              point is that Allah deals with a man according to his expectations \n              from Him. One should therefore always be hopeful of the mercy and \n              benevolence of Almighty Allah and never be despondent of His blessings. \n              Certainly, we are extremely sinful and justly deserve punishment \n              on account of our evil deeds, yet in no case should we feel despondent \n              of the mercy of Allah, as He may perhaps totally forgive us.</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Lo! Allah forgiveth not if a partner \n              be ascribed unto Him and forgiveth all save that to whom He will.\"</p>\n            <p>But Almighty Allah may or may not forgive; \n              that is why the Ulama say that true belief lies in between hope \n              (of forgiveness of Allah) and fear (of His wrath). The Holy Prophet \n              (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) once visited a young Sahabi, who was \n              breathing his last, and asked him how he was feeling. He replied, \n              \"O! Messenger of Allah, I am hopeful of the mercy of Allah, \n              and yet I am afraid of my sins.\" Thereupon the Holy Prophet \n              (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) said \"When the heart of a believer \n              is filled with these two feelings of hope and fear, Almighty Allah \n              fulfils his hope and saves him from what he is afraid of.\"</p>\n            <p>It is mentioned in one Hadith that a believer thinks of his sin, \n              as if he is sitting under a huge rock that is threatening to fall \n              on him, while for a transgressor his sin is no more than a fly which \n              is easily scared off, i.e., he takes his sins very lightly. In short, \n              one should be appropriately afraid of ones sins, and at the same \n              time remain hopeful of Allah's mercy.</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Mu'aaz (Radhiyallaho anho) died of the plague and, in the \n              moments of death's agony, he fainted many times. Whenever he regained \n              consciousness for a moment, he would say, \"Oh Allah! Thou knowest \n              that I love Thee. By Thy Honour and Glory, Thou knowest this very \n              well.\" Just before breathing his last, he said, \"0 Death, \n              you are a welcome guest but have come at a time when there is nothing \n              in the house to eat.\" Then he said, \"0 Allah! Thou knowest \n              very well that I always feared Thee, and today I die hopeful of \n              Thy forgiveness. 0 Allah! I enjoyed life, not in digging canals \n              and planting gardens, but in remaining thirsty in the hot weather, \n              in undergoing hardships for the sake of Islaam, and in taking part \n              in the gatherings engaged in zikr under the supervision of the Ulama.\"</p>\n            <p>Some Ulama have written that the fulfillment of expectations promised \n              by Almighty Allah in the aforesaid Hadith is in its most general \n              sense. It carries assurance not only in respect of forgiveness but \n              also in respect of prayers, health, wealth and safety. For instance \n              when a person prays to Allah and sincerely believes that Allah shall \n              accept his prayer, then his prayer is actually accepted, but if \n              he has doubt (that his prayer would not be accepted], it is not \n              accepted. Thus, in another Hadith it is stated that the prayer of \n              a person is granted so long as he does not say that his prayer is \n              not granted. The same is true in the case of all blessings relating \n              to health, prosperity, etc. </p>\n            <p>According to one Hadith, if a destitute person discloses his hunger \n              to everybody, he is not relieved of his poverty, but if he shows \n              submission to Gracious Allah, his condition may soon change for \n              the better. However, hoping for the better from Almighty Allah is \n              one thing, and being over-confident of His help and forgiveness \n              is another thing. Almighty Allah has warned us against such an attitude \n              in several verses of the Holy Qur'an e.g.</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Let not the deceiver (the Satan) beguile you in regard to \n              Allah\" i.e. one should not be misled by the devil to commit \n              sins just because Allah is the most Merciful and the Forgiver\".</p>\n            <p>There is another verse, </p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Hath he knowledge of the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with \n              the Beneficent. No, never.\"</p>\n            <p>The second point in this Hadith is \"Whenever a slave of mine \n              remembers Me, I am with him.\" In another Hadith, it is stated, \n              \"So long as one's lips move in My remembrance I remain with \n              him\" i.e. Almighty Allah bestows His special care and mercy \n              on him during all this time.</p>\n            <p>The third point is that Almighty Allah mentions him with a favour \n              to the angels, which signifies the value of zikr. Firstly, this \n              is because Allah created man such that inherently he is liable to \n              be good as well as to go astray, as given below in Hadith No. 8. \n              Submission on his part therefore deserves special appreciation. \n              Secondly, at the time of Aadam's creation, the Angels (who have \n              no instinct for doing evil) could not understand the creation of \n              man and had contended that he would cause blood-shed and trouble \n              in the world, while they are always there to praise and glorify \n              Almighty Allah. </p>\n            <p>Thirdly, man's worship of Allah and submission to His will is more \n              commendable than that of the Angels, because he does so on account \n              of his faith in the unseen which, however, is actually seen by the \n              angels. It is to this fact that Allah refers in the Holy Book: \"How \n              would man not have worshipped if he had actually seen the Paradise \n              and the Hell.\" It is for this reason that Almighty Allah praises \n              the noble deeds of those who worship and glorify Him without seeing \n              Him.</p>\n            <p>The fourth point contained in the above-mentioned Hadith is that \n              if a man increases his devotion to Almighty Allah, the increase \n              in His mercy and kindness upon him is proportionately far greater. \n              \"Getting near\" and \"running\" signify immediate \n              increase in His blessings and mercy. Thus, it is up to a person \n              that, if he wants to enjoy more kindness and favours from Almighty \n              Allah, he should increase his devotion to Him.</p>\n            <p>The fifth point in the above mentioned Hadith is that the Angels \n              have been stated to be superior to man, while it is commonly known \n              that man is the best creation of Allah. One reason for this has \n              already been explained in the translation (of the Hadith), that \n              the angels are superior because they are innocent and are unable \n              to commit sins. Secondly, they are superior because they are better \n              than the majority of men, including even the majority of believers; \n              and yet some selected Believers like the Prophets (Alaihimus salaam) \n              are superior to the angels. </p>\n            <p>There are other reasons as well, which are however left out in \n              order to prevent the discourse from getting too long.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

It was at the time of that \n              farewell that Rasulullah (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) had given \n              him some parting instructions.</p>\n            <p>By saying that \"the commandments of Sharee-at are many\", \n              the Sahabi had meant that although observance of every commandment \n              is imperative, to specialize and attain perfection in each and every \n              one is difficult; and so he wanted that Rasulullah (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI \n              WASALLAM), may recommend him something of over-riding importance \n              which he might hold fast to, and practice at all times and in all \n              conditions of sitting, standing or walking.</p>\n            \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>According to another Hadith, a person who possesses the following \n                four things is truly blessed, from the worldly as well as spiritual \n                point of view:—</p>\n              <p>1. A tongue ever absorbed in the zikr of Almighty Allah.<br>\n                2. A heart filled with gratitude of Allah.<br>\n                3. A body capable of undergoing hardships. <br>\n                4. A wife who does not betray her husband's trust in respect of \n                her chastity and his wealth.</p>\n            </blockquote>\n            \n            <p>The phrase \"moist tongue\" according to some Ulama means \n              excessive utterance (of zikr) and, idiomatically, it is used to \n              convey excessive glorification and praise. But in my (the author's) \n              humble opinion it can have another meaning as well. It is always \n              very sweet and pleasant to talk of one's beloved, as is the common \n              feeling and experience of every lover. On this basis, the phrase \n              \"moist tongue\" would, therefore mean that one should glorify \n              with love the name of Almighty Allah, so as to feel love's sweetness \n              in the mouth. </p>\n            <p>I have observed many times that when some of my religious elders \n              do zikr aloud, the flavour of the sweetness enjoyed by them is so \n              transmitted to the listeners that their mouths also feel the sweetness \n              and they share the ecstasy likewise. But this phenomenon is possible \n              only where there is a genuine yearning for zikr, and the tongue \n              is accustomed to excessive zikr. It is stated in one Hadith that \n              the proof of one's love for Almighty Allah lies in one's love for \n              the zikr of Allah, and in the same way lack of zikr betrays lack \n              of attachment with Almighty Allah.</p>\n         \n              <blockquote>Hadhrat Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) said that those \n                who keep their tongues wet with the zikr of Allah, will enter \n                paradise smiling.\n                \n              </blockquote>            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

From these verses, the readers can easily see \n              how important Allah considers the preaching of Islam. I have come \n              across as many as sixty verses on this particular subject, and Allah \n              knows how many more verses could be found by another keen observer. \n              I quote here a few of them for the benefit of every true believer.</p>\n            \n              <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\"And whose words can be better than his, who calls \n                (people) towards Allah, and performs good deeds. and says: 'I \n                am one of those who submit to Allah!'\"</blockquote>\n            \n            <p>Certain commentators have written that whoever invites people to \n              Allah through any means deserves the honour mentioned in the above \n              verse. </p>\n            <p>For instance, the prophets call people to Allah by means of miracles, \n              and supernatural actions, the scholars invite them by preaching \n              and arguments, the Muslim warriors (mujahids) call them by means \n              of the sword; and the muazzins call them by means of the azaan. \n              In short, whoever invites people to good deeds deserves this reward, \n              whether he calls them to the formal observances of Islam or to the \n              internal improvements of the spirit, like the mystics who stress \n              the purification of the heart and the realization of Allah's attributes.</p>\n            <p>In the concluding verse quoted above some commentators say such \n              a person should also be proud of the honour bestowed on him by Allah, \n              of being categorised as a Muslim, and he should proclaim this honour \n              in words.</p>\n            <p>Some other commentators interpret that he should not be proud of \n              being a preacher, but should consider himself as an ordinary Muslim.</p>\n            <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\"(O Prophet! SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) preach \n                to them (the Truth), for preaching proves very beneficial for \n                the Believers.\"</blockquote>\n         \n            <p>The commentators have written that by preaching is meant instructing \n              the believers through the verses of the Holy Qur'an, for these would \n              guide them to the Right Path. But such a preaching can be useful \n              for the disbelievers also, for thereby they may become believers. \n              Alas! in this age, preaching is not performed regularly and properly. \n              Generally the object of the preachers is to show off their ability \n              and eloquence to the listeners, whereas the Holy Prophet (SALLALLAHU \n              ALAIHI WASALLAM) has said:</p>\n            <p>\"Whoever learns the art of declamation in order to attract \n              the people towards himself, his prayers and observances, whether \n              obligatory or optional, will not be accepted on the Day of Judgment.\"</p>\n            \n              <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\"And command your family to observe the prayers, \n                and also perform these yourself regularly. We do not ask you for \n                sustenance. We will give you sustenance; and the ultimate success \n                is for the God-fearing.\"</blockquote>\n        \n            <p>Numerous traditions say that whenever anyone complained of poverty \n              to the Holy Prophet (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM), he recited this \n              verse, and advised him to perform his prayers regularly, as though \n              pointing to the fact that regularity in prayers will lead to ample \n              provision.</p>\n            <p>It has been stressed in this verse to do a thing yourself before \n              giving instructions to other, because this is a more effective and \n              successful method of preaching. That is why all the prophets themselves \n              first did what they preached to others. Thus they became examples \n              for their followers, who would not then think that the teaching \n              of their religion are so difficult to carry out.</p>\n            <p>Moreover, Allah has promised ample provision for those who perform \n              the prayers regularly, so that they should never feel that prayers \n              can interfere with the earning of their livelihood, whether through \n              trade, service, etc. Thereafter it is stated as a rule, that ultimate \n              success and salvation will be attained by the God-fearing only.</p>\n            \n              <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\"0 son! Perform thy prayers regularly; and command \n                people to do good deeds, and prevent them from forbidden things, \n                and bear patiently whatever befalls you (in the preaching of Truth): \n                undoubtedly this demands courage!\" (Surah Luqmaan: 17)</blockquote>\n           \n            <p>In this verse, several important things for a Muslim have been \n              mentioned, which can be a means for our salvation; but we have neglected \n              these very badly. Not to speak of the lack of preaching the truth, \n              we have neglected even the prayers, which is a basic principle of \n              Islam, in fact the most important after faith. There are so many \n              people who do not perform their prayers at all; but even those who \n              do, hardly perform it with all its requisites, such as congregational \n              prayers. It is the poor only who perform the prayers with congregation \n              in the mosque, while the rich feel it below their dignity to be \n              present in the mosque. Ah! my complaint is only to Allah!</p>\n          \n              \n            <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\n              <p>\"0 careless person!

On the other hand, the non-Muslims, are preaching their \n              religion day and night. For instance, parties of Christian missionaries \n              have been specially assigned to propagate their religion in the \n              whole world; similarly other communities are trying their best to \n              preach their own religions. But the question is, is there such an \n              organization among the Muslims? The answer, if not in the negative, \n              cannot be in the affirmative either. </p>\n            <p>If any individual or any party among the so-called Muslims arises \n              for the preaching of Islam, unreasonable objections are raised against \n              them, instead of giving them help and co-operation, whereas it is \n              the duty of every true Muslim to help those who preach Islam, and \n              to remove shortcomings where necessary; but these people neither \n              do anything themselves to preach Islam, nor help those who have \n              devoted their lives to this sacred cause. Thus the result is that \n              even the sincere and unselfish preachers are disappointed, and give \n              up their efforts in this regard.</p>\n            \n              <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\"0 Muslims! you are the best of peoples, who have \n                been selected for the guidance of mankind; you enjoin them to \n                do good deeds, and prevent them from forbidden things; and you \n                have firm faith in Allah.\" (Surah Aali Imraan: 10)</blockquote>\n          \n            <p>That the Muslims are the best of all nations, has been asserted \n              in certain sayings of the Holy Prophet (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) \n              also; and there are some verses of the Holy Qur'an that corroborate \n              this. Even the above-mentioned verse bestows the honour of 'Best \n              Nation' on us, provided we preach Islam, command people to do good \n              and prevent them from evil.</p>\n            <p>The commentators have written that in this verse, the preaching \n              of truth and prevention of evil has been mentioned before faith \n              even, whereas faith (Imaan) is the root of all Islamic beliefs and \n              actions. The reason is that faith has been a common factor among \n              all the nations of the world, but the special thing that has particularly \n              distinguished the Muslims is the mandate enjoining people to do \n              good, and to prevent them from evil. </p>\n            <p>So, this is the real basis for the superiority of the Muslims, \n              whenever they fulfilled it; and since in Islam good actions are \n              of little value without faith, it is therefore specifically mentioned \n              at the end of the verse. In fact, the real object in this verse \n              is to emphasise the importance of enjoining people to do good deeds, \n              and this is the distinguishing feature of the Muslim Ummah. It is \n              not sufficient to enjoin good and to prevent from evil only now \n              and then, but this practice should continue at all times and on \n              all occasions regularly. </p>\n            <p>Reference to the task of preaching the truth are found in earlier \n              religions, but the distinguishing merit of the Muslim Ummah lies \n              in taking it up as a regular assignment. This is not a temporary \n              work, but a permanent one.</p>\n           \n              <blockquote class=\"specialquote\">\"In the talk of an assembly of common folk there \n                is no good at all, except those who command people to give charity \n                (to the poor) or instruct them to do good things, or make peace \n                between people (they will be rewarded by Allah). And whoever does \n                this only to please Allah, soon he will receive a great reward \n                from Allah.\" (Surah Nisaa: 114)</blockquote>\n          \n            <p>In this verse, Allah has promised a great reward for those who \n              preach truth; and how great and honourable can be the reward that \n              has been called 'great' by Allah.</p>\n            <p>In this context, the Holy Prophet (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) \n              has said, \"A man's words may be a burden (sin) for him, except \n              those that he has spoken for giving instructions for good deeds, \n              and preventing others from forbidden things, or for remembering \n              Allah.\"</p>\n            <p>In another Hadith, the Holy Prophet (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) \n              has said, \"Shall I tell you a virtue better than optional prayer, \n              fasting and charity?\" His Companions said, \"You must tell \n              us that virtue, 0 Messenger of Allah!\" (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM). \n              He said: \"To make peace between people, for hate and mutual \n              conflict uproot good deeds, just as a razor removes the hair.\"</p>\n            <p>There are many more verses of the Holy Qur'an and sayings of the \n              Holy Prophet (SALLALLAHU ALAIHI WASALLAM) that instruct us to make \n              peace between people. What we mean to emphasise here is that to \n              make peace between people is also another form of instructing them \n              to do good and preventing them from evil. To introduce peace and \n              cooperation in the society should therefore be given due importance.</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

It is not the intention to encompass \n              all the relevant ahaa-dith. If I quote all the verses and the ahaadith \n              on this subject, I fear no one will read them, for now-a-days people \n              hardly spare time for such things. So. to place before you how important \n              Tabligh is in the eyes of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam), \n              and what serious consequences follow from its neglect, I give below \n              a few sayings of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam):</p>\n            \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>It is reported by Abu Sa'eed Khudri (Radhiyallaho anho) that \n                the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Whoever \n                sees a forbidden thing being done, he must prevent it by the use \n                of his hand; and if he has no power for this action, then he should \n                prevent it with his tongue; and if he cannot do this even, then \n                he should at least consider it a vice in his heart, and this is \n                a very low level of one's faith.\"</p>\n              <p>In another hadith, it has been said that if a person can prevent \n                evil with his tongue then he should so prevent it; otherwise, \n                he should at least think it evil in his heart and thus stand exonerated. \n                Another hadith says that if anyone hates sin within his heart, \n                he is a true believer, but this is the weakest form of faith. \n                This topic has occurred in many other sayings of the Prophet.</p>\n              <p>Now think well how many Muslims there are who act upon this hadith \n                in a practical way. How many of us prevent evil forcibly, how \n                many with the tongue, and how many seriously hate it within our \n                heart? We have to take stock of ourselves on these issues.</p>\n              <p>It has been reported by Nu'maan bin Basheer (Radhiyallaho anho) \n                that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"There \n                are people who do not transgress the limits (laws) of Allah, and \n                there are others who do so. They are like two groups who boarded \n                a ship; one of them settled on the upper deck, and the other, \n                on the lower deck of the ship.</p>\n              <p>So, when the people of the lower deck needed water, they said: \n                'Why should we cause trouble to the people of the upper deck when \n                we can easily have plenty of water by making a hole in our deck.' \n                Now if the people of the upper deck do not prevent this group \n                from such foolishness, all of them will perish - but if they stop \n                them then they all will be saved.\" (Bukhari &amp; Tirmizi)</p>\n            </blockquote>\n          \n            <p>Once the Companions of the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              asked him: *'0 Messenger of Allah! (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              can we people be destroyed even when there are certain pious God-fearing \n              persons among us?\" He answered: \"Yes, when evil deeds \n              predominate in a society.\"</p>\n            <p>Nowadays the Muslims are generally anxious about the decline and \n              fall of this Ummah, and they suggest certain plans to stop this \n              decline, but they never consider as to what is the main cause of \n              our decline. They fail to identify the true reason of our spiritual \n              and moral decline, particularly when the proper remedy has been \n              told by Allah and the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam).</p>\n            <p>It is a pity that because of the wrong diagnosis, incorrect remedies, \n              including continued neglect of Tabligh, are leading to the further \n              decline of the Ummah. In fact, the main cause of our decline is \n              that we do not pay attention to Tabligh nor do we help those who \n              devote themselves to this sacred mission.</p>\n          \n              \n            <blockquote>\n              <p>It has been reported by Ibn Mas'ood (Radhiyallaho anha) that \n                the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasal-lam) said: \"The \n                decline and fall of Bani Israa-eel started thus: when the pious \n                among them saw certain sins being committed by the transgressors, \n                they forbade them from doing the same; but when the sinners did \n                not repent, the pious because of their relationship and friendship \n                continued to mix with them. So, when this state of affairs began \n                to prevail, Allah caused their hearts to be accursed in the same \n                manner.\" (i.e. the hearts were also affected with the disobedience \n                of the transgressors).</p>\n              <p>Then in support of this, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n                wasallam) recited a verse of the Holy Qur'an, which says: 'The \n                disobedient and the transgressors among the Bani Israa-eel were \n                accursed by Allah.' On this, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe \n                wasallam) emphatically instructed his Companions: \"(To avoid \n                such decline) you people must enjoin upon others to do good deeds \n                and prevent them from doing forbidden things; you should restrain \n                every tyrant from tyranny and invite him towards truth and justice.*'</p>\n            </blockquote>\n          \n            <p>Another hadith says that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              was reclining comfortably when, suddenly overcome with emotion, \n              he sat up and said: tt! swear by Allah that you people cannot attain \n              salvation, unless you prevent the tyrants from tyranny.\"</p>\n            <p>Another hadith says that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              said: \"You people must preach truth, and prevent the sinners \n              from doing forbidden things, and check the tyrants, to bring them \n              towards the right path, otherwise you will be accursed and your \n              hearts will be corrupted, just as Allah did with Bani Israa-eel.\" \n              The Holy Prophet (Sallal-laho alaihe wasallam) read certain relevant \n              verses of the Holy Qur'an to emphasize this subject. Bani Israa-eel \n              were condemned because among other things, they did not prevent \n              others from doing forbidden things.</p>\n            <p>Nowadays it is considered a virtue to be at peace with all, and \n              to please everyone on every occasion. They say it is a requirement \n              of good manners with the evildoers.</p>\n            <p>Obviously, this is a wrong policy, because at most there may be \n              some religious sanction for keeping quiet in extreme case, but never \n              for falling in line with the tyrants and transgressors. At the very \n              least, every one must instruct those people to do good whom he easily \n              can influence for instance: his subordinates, his servants, his \n              wife, his children, and his relations. In such circumstances, to \n              be absolutely silent about Tabligh is unpardonable before Allah.</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Sufyaan Thowri says: \"Whoever is very popular with \n              his relations and neighbours, we suspect him to be compromising \n              in preaching the true teachings of religion.\"</p>\n            <p>Numerous traditions say that when a sin is committed secretly, \n              its harm is generally limited to the sinner only; but when a sin \n              is committed openly, and those possessing the capability do not \n              prevent it, then it ultimately affects all the people around.</p>\n            <p>Now everyone can see for himself, how many sins are committed before \n              him every day, and he, in spite of having the power to prevent them \n              neglects to do so. And it is a pity that, if anyone gets up to put \n              the wrong down, the ignorant and shameless people oppose him instead \n              of co-operating with him.</p>\n            <p>Those who do wrong will come to know by what a great reverse they \n              will be overturned.</p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Jareer bin Abdullah (Radhiyallaho anho) says, \"I heard \n              the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaho alaihe wa-sallam) saying: \"When \n              a sin is committed before an individual or a group and they do not \n              prevent it, in spite of having the capability, then Allah inflicts \n              a severe punishment on them before their death.'' (Targheeb)</p>\n            <p>0 my friends who desire the improvement of Islam and the Muslims! \n              now you have clearly seen the causes of our decline. Not to speak \n              of strangers, we generally do not prevent even our own family and \n              our subordinates from wrong-doing. </p>\n            <p>We do not even make up our minds to prevent evil, much less doing \n              something practical about it. Whatever our own son does against \n              the Commandments of Allah, we do not check him even; but if he takes \n              some interest in politics, or mixes up in a certain political party, \n              we are seriously anxious not only about him, but about our own safety \n              and honour. Then we warn him and also think about some plans to \n              be safe and secure from any harm; but on the other hand, when he \n              transgresses against Allah's Commandments, we are never anxious \n              about the life in the Hereafter, and about the Reckoning of the \n              Day of Judgement.</p>\n            <p>Sometimes you know full well that your son is addicted to some \n              idle pursuits and is very lax in his prayers, but you have no courage \n              to prevent him from such habits, or to chastise him, although Allah \n              has clearly commanded you to be severe in uprooting such evils and \n              even sever relations with the transgressor. </p>\n            <p>There is many a father who would be angry with his son, because \n              he is lazy and does not attend to his studies or services or business \n              properly, but is there anyone who is angry with his son, because \n              he does not perform the fundamental observances of Islam?</p>\n            <p>As a matter of fact, the adverse effect of this negligence is not \n              limited to the great loss in the Hereafter but it is a pity this \n              evidently extends to our worldly affairs and interests also, which \n              are so dear to us. This blindness of ours is horrible, for Allah \n              says:</p>\n            <p class=\"specialquote\">\"Whoever is blind in this world, he will be surely blind in \n              the Hereafter.\"</p>\n            <p>And such transgressors have taken leave of their senses because \n              \"Allah has sealed up their hearts, and on<br>\n              their ears and eyes there are veils (so they neither hear nor see \n              the truth).\"</p>\n            \n              <blockquote>It has been reported by Hadhrat Anas (Radhiyal-laho \n                anho) that the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wa-sallam) said: \n                \"So long as a person says \"La ilaaha iilallaah\" \n                (no one is worthy of worship but Allah), he receives spiritual \n                benefits, and is saved from miseries and calamities, unless he \n                neglects its rights.\" His Companions said: \"0 Messenger \n                of Allah (Sallaho alaihe wasallam)! how are its rights neglected?\" \n                He answered: \"When sins are committed openly, and the person \n                who recites the kalimah does not prevent the sinners from wrongdoings.\" \n                (Targheeb)</blockquote>\n        \n            <p>Now you can yourself consider how very often sins are committed \n              during these times, yet there is no serious attempt to check or \n              prevent them. In such a dangerous and ungodly atmosphere, the very \n              existence of the Muslims in the world is a great blessing of Allah, \n              otherwise we are inviting ruination through all possible means.            </p>\n            <p>Hadhrat Aa-ishah (Radhiyallaho anha) asked the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho \n              alaihe wasallam), \"When the punishment of Allah befalls the \n              inhabitants of any locality, does it affect the pious, just as it \n              affects the guilty?\" The Holy Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) \n              answered: \"Yes, it does affect all of them in this world, but \n              at the Resurrection the pious will be separated from the guilty.\" \n              Therefore, those people who are simply satisfied with their own \n              piety, and do not participate in improving others should not rest \n              assured that they are safe from the punishment of the Almighty. \n              If any chastisement is inflicted by Allah, they too will be involved \n              in it.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

A month in which the Qur'an was revealed, a month in which lies a night greater in virtue than a thousand months, a month in which the doors of Paradise are opened and the doors of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained.</p><h2>Hadith 1</h2><p>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"My Ummah has been given five things in Ramadhaan that were not given to any other nation before them:</p><ul><li>The smell emanating from the mouth of the fasting person is more pleasant to Allah than the fragrance of musk.</li><li>The fish in the sea seek forgiveness for them until they break their fast.</li><li>Allah decorates His Paradise every day and says: 'My righteous servants are about to be relieved of their hardships and enter you.'</li><li>The rebellious Shaytaans are chained so they cannot reach what they normally reach outside of Ramadhaan.</li><li>They are forgiven on the last night of Ramadhaan.' It was asked: 'Is that Laylatul Qadr?' He said: 'No, but the worker is paid when he finishes his work.'</li></ul><h2>Hadith 2</h2><p>Hadhrat Salmaan (Radhiyallaho anho) reports: \"On the last day of Sha'baan, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) addressed us and said: 'O people, there comes to you a great month, a most blessed month, in which lies a night greater in worth than one thousand months. Allah has made fasting during it obligatory and standing in prayer during its nights voluntary. Whoever draws near to Allah during this month with a good deed will be like one who performed an obligatory deed at any other time, and whoever performs an obligatory deed during this month will be like one who performed seventy obligatory deeds at any other time.'\"</p><h2>Hadith 3</h2><p>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Whoever fasts during Ramadhaan with faith and seeking reward from Allah, all his past sins will be forgiven. And whoever stands in prayer during the nights of Ramadhaan with faith and seeking reward from Allah, all his past sins will be forgiven. And whoever stands in prayer on the Night of Qadr with faith and seeking reward from Allah, all his past sins will be forgiven.\"</p><h2>Hadith 4</h2><p>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"When Ramadhaan enters, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Jahannam are closed and the devils are chained.\" In another narration: \"The gates of Mercy are opened.\"</p><h2>Hadith 5</h2><p>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Every good deed of the son of Adam shall be multiplied ten to seven hundred times. Allah says: 'Except fasting, for it is for Me and I shall reward for it. He leaves his food and drink and desires for My sake.' The fasting person has two joys: joy when he breaks his fast and joy when he meets his Lord. And indeed the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is more pleasant to Allah than the fragrance of musk.\"</p><h2>Hadith 6</h2><p>Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaho anho) relates: \"Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was the most generous of all the people, and he used to become more generous during Ramadhaan when Jibreel (alayhis salaam) used to meet him. Jibreel used to meet him every night of Ramadhaan to teach him the Qur'an. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was more generous in doing good than the blowing wind.\"</p><h2>Hadith 7</h2><p>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Fasting is a shield. So the fasting person should not behave in an ignorant manner or use foul language. If someone fights with him or insults him, he should say: 'I am fasting, I am fasting.'\"</p><h2>Hadith 8</h2><p>Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (Radhiyallaho anho) relates that Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said: \"Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need of his giving up food and drink.\"</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n        <tbody><tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\"> <h1>Virtues of Ramadhaan <br>\n              Laylatul Qadr</h1>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the nights of Ramadhaan there is one called  “Laylatul Qadr” a night that is noted for its great blessings. The Qur’aan  Kareem describes it as being greater in blessedness and spiritual virtue than a  thousand months which in turn means that it is greater than eighty three years  and four months.<br>\nFortunate indeed is that person who attains the full  blessings of this night by spending it in ‘<u>i</u>baadah of Allah, because he  has then attained reward for ‘<u>i</u>baadah of eighty three years and four  months and even more. Indeed the granting of this night to the faithful Muslim  is a great favour.</p>\n            <h2>THE ORIGIN</h2>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this night, in a Hadith reported by Anas in Durre  Manthoor Rasulullah S.W. is reported to have said: “Laylatul Qadr was granted  to my ummah and not to any other ummah before this”. Regarding the reason for  the granting of Laylatul Qadr, various reasons are mentioned. One reason,  according to some Ahaadith is given thus: Rasulullah S.W. used to look at the  longer lives of the earlier people and was saddened when pondering over the  much shorter lives of his own ummah. If his ummah had wished to compete with  the people before them in the doing of righteous deeds, because of their  shorter lives it would be impossible for them to either emulate or surpass  them. To compensate for this difference in their life span, Allah in His  infinite mercy granted them with this night of great blessing. This means that  if any fortunate one of this ummah spends during his life time ten such nights  in the worship of his maker, he would have gained the reward for ‘<u>i</u>baadah  of eight hundred and thirty years and even more. Another report states that; Rasulullah  S.W. once related to the sahaabah the story of a very righteous man from among  the Bani Israa’iyl who used to spend one thousand months in jihad. On hearing  this, the sahaabah envied that person because they could not attain the same  reward, whereupon Allah granted them the Night of Power as recompense.</p>\n            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still another report states that our Nabi once  mentioned the names of the four most pious people from among the Bani Israa’iyl  who each spent eighty years in Allah’s sincere service, worshipping Him, and  not sinning in the least. They were Nabi Ayyoob alayhis salaam and Yu’shaa alayhis  salaam. The sahaabahs head this with astonishment. Then Jibreel alayhis salaam  appeared and recited Surah Qadr, Wherein the blessing of this night was  revealed.</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these reports, there are others too, explaining the origin of the Night of Power. This type of difference in narration arises because, after occurrence of several incidents only one aayah is revealed. That aayah then is relevant to anyone of the incidents that took place. But no matter which of them we accept, the important fact that remains is that Allah has granted the ummah of Muhammad this night. This is a great favour and gift of Allah. To devote yourself on this night is also a blessing from Allah. How worthy of envy are those Mashaa’ikh who say they did not miss the ‘ibaadah of one Laylatul Qadr since they became of age. Now, as to which night it is, here again approximately fifty different views of the ‘ulama are mentioned. It is not easy for me to enumerate them all. But the most accepted versions, as well as further discussions on this night shall follow in the ensuing pages of this book. The numerous excellences of this night are mentioned in various book of Hadith. These will also be mentioned. For the reason that Qur’aan Majeed itself mentions the night, we shall commence with a short commentary on Surah Qadr. (The translations are from A. Yusuf Ali).</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of Allah the beneficent, the  merciful”. We have indeed revealed this (message) in the Night of Power. (Suratul  Qadr: 1).</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference here is made to the fact that on this  special night, the Qur’aan was sent down from Al Lowhul Mahfuz (the preserved  Table) to the heavens (above the earth). Because a great book like Qur’aan was  revealed in this night is in itself sufficient to explain its excellence,  needless to mention all other blessings and virtues which are include. In the  very  verse by way of drawing and increasing our interest in the matter  under discussion, a question is asked:</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And what will explain to  you what the Night of Power is”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Suratul Qadr: 2)</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the question asked here is: Have  you any knowledge as to the great favours and bounties that are placed in tin?  The  verse proceeds to enumerate some of that greatness:</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The night of Power is better than a thousand  months”.</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true meaning here is that reward for  spending this night in ‘<u>i</u>baadah is better and more than having spent  one&nbsp; thousand months ‘<u>i</u>baadah, it  is we are not told here.</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">“Therein come down the  Angels and the Spirit by Allah’s permission on every errand”.<br>\n            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Suratul Qadr: 4)            \n            </p><p align=\"left\">A fine explanation is given in this verse by  Imaam Raazi R.A. commenting on this verse he explains that when man first  appeared on earth, created by Allah as His vicegerent on earth, the Malaa’ikah  looked on him with scorn. When Allah informed them of His intention of placing  man on earth, they even ventured to ask: “Will you place in this earth one who  shall commit evil therein and shed blood?”            \n            </p><p class=\"para\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when his parents noted his original  form as a mere drop of mani (sperm), they too looked upon it with scorn and  resentment, so much so, that they considered it as something which polluted  clothing and had to be washed away. But later when Allah made that same  despicable sperm into a fine form of man, they began to love and cherish him.  So far have things now progressed that when on this Night of Power we see that  same man worshipping Allah and adoring Him, those very same Malaa’ikah which  had ly looked down on him with scorn, descend towards him, obviously  repentant for the thoughts they had once harboured against him.</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this verse mention is made… “and the spirit”.  Reference is clearly to Jibraeel alayhis salaam. Commentators of the Qur’aan  have given various versions of this word. Let us look at some of them:\n            </p><p align=\"left\">(a) The vast majority of the commentators are agreed  that Jibraeel alayhis salaam is meant here, and according to Imaam Raazi,  (R.A.) this is the most correct meaning. Allah first makes mention of the  Malaa’ikah and then because of Jibraeel’s alayhis salaam status among them,  special mention made of him.                                    \n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">(b) Some commentators hold the view that “Spirits”  here means one angel of such extra ordinary gigantic proportion that before him  heavens and earth appear as almost nothing (as a morsel).                                    \n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">(c) Another group of commentators opine that  “Spirit” here means one such group of Malaa’ikah who never appear and only on  this night are they seen by other Malaa’ikah.                                    \n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">(d) Some commentators again believe that the  “Spirit” here designates one such creation of Allah, which although it partakes  of food and drink, still is neither man nor angel.\n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">(e) There is also a view that “Spirit” here refers  to ‘Iysaa alayhis salaam who on this night comes down with the Malaa'ikah to  view the righteous deeds of this ummah.                                    \n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">(f) The last view we wish to mention here is that  “Spirit” means Allah’s special mercy which comes in the wake of the angels  descent. But already stated the first opinion is the most acceptable.                                    \n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">In this respect Imaam Bayhaqi R.A. reports a  Hadith by Anas wherein Rasulullah S.W. is reported to have said, “On Laylatul  Qadr Jibraeel alayhis salaam comes down with a group of angels and make duaa’  for mercy for every one whom they find busy in ‘<u>i</u>baadah”. This same  verse under discussion says,                                    \n            </p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“… By Allah’s permission on every errand…”.                                    \n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of Mazhaahire Haq writes that on this  night ages ago the Malaa’ikah were created: on this night long ago the creation  on Aadam alayhis salaam was begun as the matter from which he was created had  been gathered: on this night trees were platned in Jannah and large number of  Ahaadith bear witness to the fact that on this night duaa’s are granted. Similarly  we read in the kitaab, Durre Manthoor, that according to a Hadith it was on  this night that ‘Iysa alayhis salaam was lifted up bodily into the heavens and  also it was on this night that the towbah (repentance) of Bani Israa-‘iyl was  accepted.\n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Peace be until the break of dawn”.\n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is the very embodiment of peace.  Throughout its hours the Malaa’ikah recite salaam upon faithful believers  adoring their Lord. As one group descends another ascends as is explained in  the Ahaadith. Another interpretation is that it is a night of complete safety  from evil and mischief.\n                                    </p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These blessings remain throughout the night  until the break of dawn and are not confined to any specific hour. And now  having noted a few virtues of this night as explained in the words of Allah,  there is no further need to quote any Ahaadith. However, since many virtues  have been in numerous Ahaadith we mention a few here.\n                                    \n</p>        </td></tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

            "content": "<div class=\"story-content\"><table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n        <tbody><tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\"> <h1>Virtues of Ramadhaan - I'itikaaf</h1>\n            <h2>I'ITIKAAF - SECLUSION IN THE MASJID</h2>\n            <p>The meaning of 'I'tikaaf' is to seclude oneself in the Mosque, \n              with the express intention (Niyyat)of 'I'tikaaf'. According to the \n              Hanafi school of thought, this may be of three different types:</p>\n            <p>a) Waajib I'tikaaf (Obligatory I'tikaaf)<br>\n              I'tikaaf becomes compulsory when a person makes it obligatory upon \n              himself. For example, when a person makes a vow to Allah that if \n              Allah fulfils a certain wish of his, he shall perform so many days \n              'I'tikaaf', in this case, the moment his wish is fulfilled, the \n              I'tikaaf becomes compulsory. Or a person may just make an unconditional \n              vow, whereby he makes I'tikaaf Waajib upon himself for a certain \n              number of days; this becomes obligatory for him from that moment \n              onwards.</p>\n            <p>b) Sunnat I'tikaaf<br>\n              This was the general practice of the Holy Prophet (SAW). It means \n              to seclude oneself in the Masjid for the last ten days of Ramadhaan.</p>\n            <p>c) Nafl I'tikaaf<br>\n              For the third category i.e. Nafl I'tikaaf, no special time and no \n              specific number of days are fixed. A person may make a Niyyah (intention) \n              for any number of days at any time, even for his whole life.</p>\n            <p>While Imaam Abu Hanifa states that I'tikaaf must be for not less \n              than a full day, Imaam Muhammad states that there is no limit as \n              to the minimum period of time. The 'Fatwa'confirms this latter view. \n              Therefore, it is desirable for anyone entering a Masjid to make \n              the 'Niyyah' (intention) of I'tikaaf for the period that he will \n              remain in the Masjid; so that, while he is in Ibaadah, he also earns \n              the reward of I'tikaaf. </p>\n            <h2>OBJECTS OF I'TIKAAF AND ITS ADVANTAGES</h2>\n            <p>In view of the above, it is advisable that everyone entering the \n              Masjid to join the congregational prayer should, on entering the \n              Masjid, make the Niyyat for 'I'tikaaf', in thatcase it means that \n              aslong as he remain busy with Salaat, Zikr, listening to lectures \n              or sermons he also receive reward for the I'tikaaf. I always observed \n              that my late father used to make 'Niyyat' for I'tikaaf whenever \n              he entered the Masjid. Occasionally, by way of teaching and reminding \n              his followers, he would raise his voice when reciting when reciting \n              the words for 'Niyyah'. The reward for I'tikaaf is great as indicated \n              by the fact that the Holy Prophet (SAW) always used to perform I'tikaaf. \n              The example of him who resides in the Masjid in I'tikaaf is that \n              of a person who, having gone to a certain place to appeal for something, \n              remains there until it is granted. When someone comes begging at \n              our door and then refuses to leave until he has been granted his \n              request. I am sure that even the person with the hardest heart amongst \n              us will eventually give in to his request. How much more Merciful \n              is Allah, and when someone persistently sits at His door, what doubt \n              can there be in the fulfilment of his wishes. Allama ibn Qayyim, \n              in explaining the significance of I'tikaaf writes that the actual \n              aim is to divert the heart away from everything except Allah, and \n              to make it come near to Allah, thereby forming a complete spiritual \n              connection with the Creator. All wordly connections are thus cut \n              off, for the sake of gaining Allah's attention and all thoughts, \n              desires, love and devotion become centred around Him. As a result, \n              an attachment with Allah is attained - a love and friendship that \n              will be the only support in loneliness of the grave. One can possibly \n              imagine the great ecstacy with which that time in the grave will \n              be spent.</p>\n            <p>In Maraaiqul Falaah, the author writes that I'tikaaf, when properly \n              and sincerely performed, is among the most virtuous deeds. One cannot \n              possibly enumerate all the great advantages and benefits in it. \n              In actual fact, what takes place in I'tikaaf is that the heart is \n              drawn away from everything else except the Creator, while the soul \n              is actually laidat His door-step. All the time, one remains in a \n              state of 'Ibaadah', even when one is asleep, one is still in His \n              worship striving for nearness to Him. And Allah says (according \n              to a Hadith): \"Whoever draws near to Me (the length of) one \n              hand, then I draw nearer to him (the length of) two hands, and whoever \n              draws near to Me by walking, I draw nearer to him by running.\" \n              Moreover, in I'tikaaf one seeks refuge in the house of Allah, and \n              is safe therein from all enemies.<br>\n            </p>\n            <h2>WHERE TO PERFORM I'TIKAAF</h2>\n            <p>The best of places for I'tikaaf is the Masjidul Haram in Makkah.</p>\n            <p>The  best is the Masjidun-Nabawiy in Madinah, and the  \n              best is Baytul Muqaddas. Thereafter, comes the Jaama Masjid in one's \n              own time, and last but not least, the Masjid nearest to one's home. \n              Imaam Abu Hanifa stipulates that the Masjid should be one wherein \n              the five daily Salaatare regularly performed, while Imaam Abu Yusuf \n              and Imaam Muhammad agree that any Masjid acceptable to the Shari'ah \n              can be entered for I'tikaaf. I’<u>i</u>tikaaf  even if there is no regular ‘salaah with Jamaa-ah.</p>\n            <p>The above applies to the males. As for the females, they should \n              perform It'ikaaf in the prayer room (Masjid set aside in their homes). \n              Where, however, no such demarcated place exists, any one room or \n              part of the house should be set aside for this purpose. I'tikaaf \n              is thus in fact an easier task for women. The domestic duties can \n              be performed by daughters or servants under her supervision and \n              the woman in I'tikaaf, while remaining in a section of her own house, \n              is spiritually rewarded for it. It is so very unfortunate that, \n              in spite of this relative ease, our womenfolk still remain deprived \n            of the blessings of I'tikaaf.</p>\n            <p>As  for the females, they should perform I’<u>i</u>tikaaf in the musjid exists and  the desire for I’<u>i</u>tikaaf be there, one room of the house should be set  aside for this purpose, I’<u>i</u>tikaaf is in fact an easier task for women. A  special section of the wherein they seclude themselves, remaining in ‘<u>i</u>baadah.  The domestic duties can then be performed by daughters or servants, and the  women in I’<u>i</u>tikaaf, while remaining in a section of her own house, is  spiritually rewarded for it. It is so very unfortunate that in spite of the  ease, our women folk still remain deprived of the blessings of I’<u>i</u>tikaaf.

How much importance \n              do we attach to it in Ramadhaan? How many nafl do we perform? As \n              for fardh deeds, we observe how numerous people who after having \n              eaten sah'ri get back into bed with the result that the Fajr 'salaah \n              is neglected. Many perform it, but not with Jamaa'ah. It gives the \n              impression that we give thanks to Allah for the food we had eaten \n              for sah'ri by not performing the most important fardh or by not \n              performing it with Jamaa'ah. Such a 'salaah has been termed defective. \n              Rasulullah (SAW) said that, \"There is no 'salaah for those \n              near the musjid except in the musjid\".</p>\n            <p>In the kitaab 'Mazhaahire Haq' we find that there is no reward \n              for the 'salaah for persons who do not perform 'salaah with Jamaa'ah \n              without any valid reason or excuse.</p>\n            <p>Similarly, in numerous cases at the time of if'taar (boeka) Maghrib \n              'salaah is missed, and many who do not come to the musjid miss the \n              Takbeer at the beginning or miss the first raka'ah. Many people \n              hasten to get over the Taraaweeh 'salaah early and even perform \n              the 'ishaa' 'salaah before the time of 'Ishaa' commences. (Some \n              do not pay any attention to 'salaah even in Ramadhaan.)</p>\n            <p>That is the way we look after our very important fardh 'salaah \n              in Ramadhaan. Sometimes in the process of performing one fardh, \n              three others are destroyed. How often do we see even the time of \n              Zhuh-r 'salaah going by because we are asleep, while time of A'sr \n              goes by because we are too busy buying, selling or cooking to prepare \n              for if'taar.</p>\n            <p>If such is the case with the faraa'idh, then we can imagine how \n              much less importance is given to the nafl actions. One finds that \n              because of sleep, the time of 'salaatul Ishraaq (after sunrise) \n              and 'salaatul Dhuhaa (before noon) go by. </p>\n            <p>Then what about 'salaat Awwaabeen (just after Maghrib)? Here we \n              find ourselves busy with If'taar and when thinking about Taraaweeh \n              after about an hour this 'salaah too is wasted. Further we find \n              that for 'salaatul Ta-hajjud the time is the same as that for sah'ri \n              with the result that this too goes by. One may make a thousand excuses \n              for not finding time for these nawaafil. These are all excuses for \n              not performing these 'salaah.</p>\n            <p>We see that there are many who do find the time to do all these \n              'ibaadahs during these precious moments. I personally had observed \n              my ustaaz Maulana Khalil Ahmad during many a Ramadhaan. He was a \n              weak sickly person and of advanced age but in spite of these drawbacks \n              he used to read one and a quarter juz of the Qur'an in nafl namaaz \n              after Maghrib. Thereafter he used to have meals for about half an \n              hour. After performing all other necessities in preparation for \n              Taraaweeh 'salaah he used to stand in Taraaweeh for about two and \n              a half hours when he was in India, and when he was in Madinah Munawwarah \n              the duration was three hours. </p>\n            <p>Thereafter he used to sleep about two or three hours (according \n              to the season). Then he used to again recite the Qur'aan in Tahajjud \n              'salaah until about half an hour before Fajr. Then he ate sah'ri. \n              From that time until Fajr he remained busy with reading the Qur'aan \n              or reciting of wazifas. With the greyness of dawn he performed Fajr \n              'salaah, thereafter he remained in meditation (muraa-qabah) until \n              Ishraaq. Having performed Ishraaq he used to write his famous kitaab, \n              'Baziul Majhood', commentary on Abu Dawood. Then he normally attend \n              to letters and dictating replies up to mid-day. Then he used to \n              rest up to Zhuh-r 'salaah. Between Zhuh-r and A'sr he used to recite \n              the Qur'aan.</p>\n            <p>From A'sr Namaaz until Maghrib he used to be busy with tasbeeh \n              and answering the queries of those who visited him. When he completed \n              'Baziul Majhood' then part of the morning used to be spent in tilaawah \n              and studying some monumental religious works, especially Baziul \n              Majhood and Wafa al Wafa. This was his daily programme for nafl \n              'ibaadah throughout the year. </p>\n            <p>In Ramadhaan however, he used to spend a bit more time in his i’baadah, \n              making the rak'aats longer. For the ordinary person to observe the \n              special programmes the other pious elders had for Ramadhaan would \n              be difficult. Shaikhul Hind Maulana Mahmoo-dul Hasan (Rahmatullah \n              alaihi) used to remain in nafl 'salaah from after Taraaweeh until \n              Fajr, while also listening to the Qur'aan recited by various huffaazh \n              one after the other.</p>\n            <p>Maulana Shah Abdurraheem Raipuri (d 1963) remained busy with tilaawah \n              (recitation) of the Qur'aan day and night through Ramadhaan. There \n              used to be no time for attending to correspondence or meeting visitors. \n              Only his special ones were allowed to wait on him after Taraaweeh \n              for a short period while he drank a cup of tea.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

It is written with the object \n              that we in our way may build up courage and to the best of our ability \n              endeavor to copy and follow their noble examples. Every pious elders \n              programme had its particular specialty.</p>\n            <p>How wonderful would it be if those who are not forced by worldly \n              necessities try their utmost to mend their religious life in this \n              one month after having allowed eleven months of the year go by to \n              destroy themselves.</p>\n            <p>As for those who have to be in their offices and be present at \n              eight, nine or ten in the morning, what difficulty will it be for \n              them if they at least in Ramadhaan, spend the time from Fajr until \n              their hours of employment in reciting the Qur'aan. After all our \n              worldly needs we do find time in spite of office hours.</p>\n            <p>For those engaged in farming, who normally are not bound to others \n              nothing prevents them from reciting the Qur'aan on their farm or \n              adjusting their daily routine. Then come the businessmen, shopkeepers \n              and merchants. </p>\n            <p>Nothing prevents them in Ramadhaan from reciting their Qur'aan \n              during their shop hours or cutting short trading time in order to \n              make time for recitation thereof. After all there is very strong \n              link between Ramadhaan and the Tilaa-wah of the Qur'aan. Almost \n              all Allah's great scriptures were revealed in this month. Similarly, \n              in this month the Qur'aan was brought down from the Lowhul Mahfoozh \n              to the Samaa'ud Dunyaa, from where it was revealed bit by bit to \n              Rasulullah (SAW) in a span of twenty three years.</p>\n            <p>Nabi Ibrahim (A.S.) received his scriptures on the first and third \n              of this sacred month. Nabi Dawood (A.S.) received the Zaboor on \n              the twelfth or eighteenth. Nabi Moosa (A.S.) received his Towrah \n              on the sixth. Nabi Essa (A.S.) received the Injeel on the twelfth \n              or thirteenth. From this we note the great connection between the \n              divine scriptures and the month of Ramadhaan. </p>\n            <p>For this reason, as much ti-laawah of the Qur'aan as possible should \n              be made during this month. Such was the habit of our saints. Jibraeel \n              (A.S.) used to recite the whole Qur'aan to our Nabi Muhammad (SAW) \n              in the month of Ramadhaan. In some reports it is stated that Rasulullah \n              (SAW) used to recite and he (Jibraeel) used to listen. From joining \n              these reports the 'ulama have said that it is mustahab to read the \n              Qur'aan in such a manner that while one recites the other listens. \n              Thereafter another recites while others listen. So recite the Qur'aan \n              as much as possible. Whatever time remains thereafter should not \n              be wasted.</p>\n            <p>Rasulullah (SAW) drew our attention to four more things and advised \n              that we should practice them as much as possible. They are the recitation \n              of Kalimah 'Tayyibah, Istighfaar, begging for Jannah and seeking \n              refuge from Ja-hannam. Therefore it must be regarded an honour to \n              spend as much as available in these recitations. This will be the \n              true appreciation of the teachings of Rasulullah (SAW). What is \n              so difficult about keeping the tongue busy with the recitation of \n              Durood ('salawaat) or <br>\n              Laa ilaaha illallaah while being engaged in our daily tasks?</p>\n            <p>In the same Hadith Rasulullah (SAW) said a few more things, Ramadhaan \n              is the month of patience. Hence even if great difficulty is experienced \n              in fasting one should bear it with patience. One should not complain \n              as people are fond of doing during hot days.</p>\n            <p>If by chance sah-ri is missed then lamentations begin early in \n              the day. Similarly, should difficulty be experienced at the same \n              time of Taraweeh, it too should be borne with patience. Do not consider \n              it a great calamity or trial, otherwise these deeds may be void \n              of blessings. When we turn our backs on worldly things, forsake \n              our very eating and drinking, then in the face of Allah's pleasure \n              what are these difficulties?</p>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

Sympathy should be of a practical nature. \n              When ten things are placed before us for if'taar, at least two or \n              four of them should be set aside for the poor and needy.

In showing sympathy for the \n              poor, as in all other matters, the Sahaabah R.A. were living examples, \n              and in this, it is our duty to follow or at least try to follow \n              them. In the matter of sacrifice and sympathy only the courageous \n              can emulate the Sahaabah. There are numerous instances, if they \n              are cited, will only leave one in astonishment.</p>\n            <p>Let us see the following example, Abu Jahm (RA) relates that: \"During \n              the battle of Yarmouk he went in search of his cousins, taking with \n              him a water bag to give him to drink and also wash his wounds if \n              he was found alive or wounded. He found him lying among the wounded. \n              When I asked him whether he wanted some water, he indicated 'yes'.            </p>\n            <p>At that moment someone near him moaned. My cousin pointed to that \n              person indicating that I should first quench the thirst of the neighbour. \n              I went to him and found that he too needed water, but just as I \n              was about to give him water, a third person groaned near him. </p>\n            <p>The second one pointed to this third person meaning that I should \n              give the third one to drink first. </p>\n            <p>I went to the third person but before he could drink, I found out \n              that he had passed away, whereupon I returned to the second one \n              only to find that he too had passed away.

The collection really amounts to a handful  of petals from the vast garden of the teachings of Islam, which I have  hurriedly picked up for presentation to the readers. There may be mistakes and  omissions in the presentation, for which I beg my readers to make allowance,  and request them to be so kind as to amend or correct those mistakes if  necessary, thereby earning my gratitude.<br>\nIt is my earnest prayer that  may Haq-Ta’ala (Shanahoo) by His special favours and kindness, and for the sake  of the noble personages connected with this work, forgive me for my sins and  not uncover my misdeeds, but He may graciously enable us all to lead a pious  and virtuous life. May He bestow upon us the wealth of His own love, and grant  us the approval to follow His own chosen faith of Islam. May He also give us  the power to propagate Islam in strict obedience and loyalty to His dearest and  the most distinguished Prophet, (Hadhrat Mohammad Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam).\n</p><div align=\"right\">MOHAMMAD EHTESHAM-UL-HASSAN (DELHI)<br>\n18 RUBIYYUSANI 1358 (HIJRI)</div>\n<div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/scan0002.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div><br>\n\n\n<h2>PAST HISTORY</h2>\n            <p><br>\n            About thirteen and a half  centuries ago, when the world was sunk in the darkness of ignorance, sin and  impiety, a light of true knowledge and guidance rose from the horizon of the  rugged hills of Batha*. Its rays spread to the East, West, North and South;  they reached every corner of the earth and within the short period of 23 years,  the way was paved through that light for the mankind to move to such heights of  glory as had never been attained before. It enlightened Muslims and created in  them the urge for taking the right counsel, which would ultimately bring them  their salvation. By following the right path and the guidance emanating from  that light, the Muslims moved from success to success and attained the highest  pinnacle of glory in history. For centuries, they ruled on this earth with such  grandeur and strength that no contemporary power had the courage to challenge  them and, if someone dared to do so, he did that at the risk of being  annihilated. This is the historical truth, which cannot by erased. But, alas!  this fact of history has only become a myth, an ancient tale, to narrate which  may sound meaningless and ridiculous, particularly in the context of the  present day life of Muslims, which obviously is a blot on the brilliant  performance and achievements of their ancestors, the early followers of Islam.</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

And if the “Ummat-e-Mohammadiah” becomes guilty of that  neglect and omission, the punishment to be given to them will be more severe  than to the earlier people, becau ethey would have failed to recognize their  exclusive obligation and neglected to fulfil the sole mission in their life.  For this reason, the Holy Prophet (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam) has enjoined the  act of “Amir bil maruf wa nahin anil munkar” (enjoining the good and forbidding  the evil) “as the essence and the pivot of the faith of Islam” and the abandonment  of that act as the cause of decay and decline of the faith. <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “Hadis” of Abu Saeed  Khudri, (radi Allaho anho) it is mentioned:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/manrai_minkum.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When anyone of your  witness the commission of evil, he should use his hands to prevent it: and if  he has not the power to do this, he should use his tongue; and if he has not  the power to do even this, he should use the power of his heart; and this last  represents the weakest degree of faith.”<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is yet a clearer  version of the same “Hadis” from Ibne Masud (radi Allaho anho);</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/maa_minnabiyyu.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is usual for Allah to  so arrange that every Prophet leaves behind a group of his companions who  perpetuate His message, who follow it rigorously and preserve the holy message  exactly in the form in which the Messenger left it. Then comes en epoch of  mischief and error, an epoch that witnesses the birth of people who step aside  from the path laid down by the Prophet. Their actions are at variance with  their proclamations; their activities are not warranted by the holy law. So  whosoever arises in defence of Truth and Law, and opposes the miscreants with  his hands, is a true believer; he who cannot do this but uses his toungue, is a  believer too; and he who cannot, do even this, but uses the power of his heart,  is also a believer; but less than this, there is no degree of faith-(Muslims).</p>\n            <p>The vital importance of Tabligh&nbsp;  (the task of propagation) has been further emphasized by Imam Ghazali,  (rahmatullah alaih) in the following manner:</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

As a result, real sentiments and love for Islam  are practically dead in us and our belief in it has dissipated. Obviously, when  the very source becomes dry, the channels of virtue, good deeds and fine  attributes, which can flow from it, are not to be seen any longer. This is  exactly what is evident today. It has been fully discussed and brought out  earlier that the only means for the building up of this source, and maintaining  a constantly proper flow of religious benefits from it, is the act of  “Tabligh”, which really and truly is the life-blood of Islam. Unless we are  able to revive it, we cannot achieve anything in this life because no nation of  people can rise to glory without having in them the high human attributes and  character which only the religion of Islam can give.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should now clearly  feel the disease from which we suffer and judge the treatment which can bring  the remedy. It is now up to us to set about the revival of the obligatory task  of “Tabligh”. It will be only then that we can hope to regenerate the true  faith of Islam in the masses. By this means alone can we recognize and truly  understand both Allah Ta'ala and His Holy prophet, Hadhrat Mohammad (Sallallaho  Alaihe Wasallam), and will be able to clearly understand and finally submit to  their commands and wishes. To achieve all this, we will have to adopt the exact  methods and ways which are laid down and were demonstrated by the Holy prophet  (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam) himself when he reformed the pagan Arabs. Allah  Ta'ala says in the Quran:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/lakad_kaana.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Indeed the Holy prophet  (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam) is the perfect example for you to follow.”<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this very connection,  Hadhrat Imam Malik (Rahmatullah Alaihi) said:</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reformation of the last  (part) of this (Mohammad’s) Ummat will not be possible except by adopting the  method which was used in the beginning (by Hadhrat Mohammad (Sallallaho Alaihe  Wasallam).</p>\n            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  the beginning, when the Holy prophet (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam) had started  to call the people to Islam, he did not have a single supporter behind him nor  had he any political power or possessions. The Pagan Arabs were arrogantly  independent and self-opinionated. No one among them was prepared to listen to  reason or truth or obey another person. They strongly disliked and were deadly  opposed to the “Kalimah-tul-Haq”, which the Holy prophet (Sallallaho Alaihe  Wasallam) had the sole mission to teach. In these circumstances, one wonders  what gave such invisible power and force to that one single man, who was wordly  poor and without any means, that he eventually was able to draw the whole of  the Arab nation towards him. First we ought to carefully think and see what was  it refused, but came running towards him as soon as they perceived the light,  and steed by him so close that they never left him again. It was the message of  Eternal Truth to which he called!-that and only that (Truth), which was the  Holy Prophet’s (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam) sole mission and aim in life-and  which he so beautifully presented to the people!

The method adopted by the Holy  Prophet (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam) was as follows:<br>\n  A jamaat or group of at least ten men should be formed. One of them  should be selected “amir” (leader). They should get together in a mosque, make  ablutions and offer two *rakaat ‘nafil’ prayers. After this, all should  supplicate together and beseech for Divine mercy, help and guidance for success  in their efforts and remaining steadfast and resolute in their task of Tabligh.  For all this time, “zikr” should be recited by all, and every precaution should  be taken not to indulge in the idle talk. One reaching the place for “Tabligh”,  once again the “jamaat” should supplicate and beseech for Allah Ta'ala’s mercy  and help in their mission. The place of Tabligh will be the vicinity of a  mosque of the locality where the work is to be conducted. A part of the  “jamaat” should be detailed to tour the locality calmy, and quietly inviting  people to the mosque, where “Ta'aleem, (reading and teaching out of religious  books) should be in progress and later the “namaz” (prayers) of the time should  be offered. After this, one of the members of the “jamaat” should place before  the people, in an affectionate and calm manner, the importance and urgency of  reviving Islam in each and every Muslim as ordained by Allah Ta'ala and the  Holy Prophet (Sallallaho Alaihe Wasallam), giving out as simply as possible the  cardinal points of Tabligh and the way to accomplish them. Finally, the people  should be persuaded, again in a cordial manner, to join hands in this sacred  task and come out to do the work of Tabligh like the Jamaat itself.</p>\n            <p><br>\n              Later, some members of the “jamaat” may accompany the people to their  homes, where the womenfolk should also be addressed and persuaded to do similar  duty among women.<br>\n              They should be told be regular in their daily prayers. All this should be  done without entering the private portion of any house. The women should also  be told to strictly follow the cardinal points of “Tabligh” in their daily life  and observe “pardah” in accordance with the “shariat”.<br>\n              After this, all such people who may be prepared to join the work should  be organized into a separate “jamaat” with and “amir” form among themselves.  They should first be made to work under the guidance of the members of the  original “jamaat”. The important point to be remembered at this stage is that  every person engaged on “Tabligh” must fully obey his “amir” and the latter, in  turn, should ensure that his personal services and attention are available to  each and every member of his Jamaat. He must see to every person’s welfare,  comforts and morale and, before taking any decision, th must consult all his  colleagues. The following general principles of the work of “Tabligh” should be  carefully noted at all times.<br>\n            </p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

It  literally means to follow in the footsteps of the Prophets. truly, as the work  is of a very superior character, it must be based on equally high principles,  which ought to be strictly followed throughout. Each participant must feel that  it is he who needs to improve himself rather than thinking of reforming others.  During the course of work and, even away from it, he must try to behave as a  perfect Muslim, as a faithful slave of Allah Ta’ala, constantly obeying and  following the Divine commands of&nbsp;  “Shariat” and always seeking Allah Ta’ala’s mercy and pleasure. This is  the basic requirement and the soul and foundation of the work of “Tabligh”.  Once it is deeply and firmly embedded in the hearts of workers, the other  principles, rules and practices, some of which are narrated below, will become  easy to follow:<br>\n(1) As far as  possible, all expenses, including travelling, food etc., must be borne by each  individual himself and , if he can afford, he may quietly assist those  companions who may be in need. <br>\n(2) All fellow  workers and companions in this work must be given full respect, shown  tolerance, be cared for and encouraged at all times by one another. Such  participation will prove a great blessing for the whole area where the “jamaat”  may be working.<br>\n(3) Conversations,  talks and discussions must be conducted in soft and persuasive tones, using  simple and polite language. All types of displeasure with each other must be  avoided. The “ulema-e-karam” (scholars of Muslim scripture) must be held in  high respect and esteem as we usually display for the “Holy Quran” and “Hadis”  , because, it is through these learned personages that Allah Ta’ala has blessed  us with the true knowledge of Islam and enlightenment. Any disrespect towards  them, however insignificant, may amount to contempt of Islam itself, which in  turn may provoke the wrath of Allah Ta’ala for the whole community. <br>\n(4) Leisure and free  moments must be spent either in reading good religious books or in the company  of pious and learned companions; by this means one will be able to learn many  right things about the faith of Islam, about Allah Ta’ala and His apostle. Particular  care must be taken of the time given to the “Tabligh” work itself, that nothing  unimportant, useless or senseless is uttered, discussed or done.<br>\n(5) To endeavour to  earn an honest and pure living, to be most careful and frugal in expenditure,  and to constantly observe every single obligation, however big or small,  towards one’s family relations and acquaintances.<br>\n(6) No controversial  matters or points of secondary importance be discussed at any time. The total  time must be devoted to bringing out the Divinity, Oneness and Omnipotence of  Allah Ta’ala and to confine all talk to the main points of “Tabligh”, which are  in real sense the basic principles to be followed by each and every Muslim at  all times.<br>\n(6) Every action,  work and speech must be fused with sincerity and honesty of purpose, for and  act, however small, but imbued with this quality is destined to bring high  rewards and plenty of well-being. On the other hand, an insincere act, however  big, will not bear any worthwhile fruit or benefit, either in this life or in  the hereafter. Hadhrat Mu’az (Radi) Allaho anho), who was appointed as Governor  of Yemen, begged the Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) to give him some  special advice. The Holy Prophet (sallallaho alaihe wasallam) was pleased to  say, “Be meticulously honest and sincere in matters of religion: a little done  with sincerity is enough”. There is yet another “Hadis” in the same connection,  “Allah Ta’ala accepts only such actions and deeds which are performed purely  for His pleasure and accord”. In another place it is mentioned “Allah Ta’ala  does not look at your face nor at your property,but only at your hearts and  deeds”. So the crux of the matter is that the work of “Tabligh” must be  performed with all sincerity and honesty. No show or outward appearance is to  be put on. The depth of success and progress will depend entirely on the depth  of our sincerity.</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

It now  remains to be judged as to how all this can guide us and bring us the desired  relief and benefits in these times, which are fraught with confusion, unrest  and rivalries.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this, once again, we have to  seek guidance from the allwise “Holy Quran”, which refers to the hard work and  endurance for the faith of Islam as a highly profitable business, and puts it  across in the following manner:</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/ya_ayyuhallazina.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <p>“O you who believe! Shall I point out to you a  trade that will shield you from a grievous doom?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe in Allah and His Messenger,  and perform “jehad” in His way with your wealth and lives. This is best for  you, if you understand. Your Lord will forgive your sins, and you shall enter  Paradise, under&nbsp;&nbsp; which ripple  (beauteous) streams, and stately abodes in everlasting gardens; and this is  great success…<br>\n              And another which you covet much, i.e., succor  from Allah and victory near at hand; and give glad tidings to those who  believe.”<br>\n              The above verse describes a trade, which if  accepted promises deliverance from all types of afflictions and punishments.  The trade is meant: to have a firm faith in Allah Ta’ala and His Apostle and to  struggle hard in the path of Allah, without shirking to use one’s life and  wealth. This again points to the act of “Tabligh”, which can ensure for us  everlasting well-being and happiness. It is this simple work which will bring  us great benefits, such as the forgiveness for all our sins, deliberate  mistakes and shortcomings and high rewards in the life hereafter. So much for  the success in the  life, which really is the greatest triumph for a  Muslim, but there is also clear hint for this life too. We shall get what we  cherish most, such as prosperity, divine help and success against all our  adversaries! <br>\n              In other words, Allah Ta’ala has demanded two things from us, firstly to  have firm faith in Him and His Apostle, secondly, to struggle hard in His path,  giving, if need be, our lives and all that we posses. In return for this, He  has also promised two things: first a beautiful and peaceful abode in Heaven  (Jannat) with an eternal life, and everlasting happiness: and second, glory and  success in this life. The first demand on us is that of faith (eiman). This is  exactly what the “Tabligh” is&nbsp; meant to  bring to us, that we should all be endowed with the wealth of true faith. The  second demand is that of striving in the path of Allah, which actually means  “jehad”. Jehad may normally mean fighting a war against oppressors and  non-believers. In the practical sense, however, it means spreading of Kalimah  of Allah and enforcing of Allah’s Commandments, which is also the ultimate aim  of “Tabligh”.<br>\n              It should be clear to us now that the happiness and success in the life  after death is solely dependent of having firm faith in Allah Ta’ala and His  Apostle, and in striving hard in the path laid down by Him. Similarly, the  success and prosperity in this life too depend entirely on that very faith and  on spending all our efforts in the path of Allah Ta’ala.</p>\n            When we fulfil these basic requirements, firstly  of faith in Allah Ta’ala and His Apostle, and secondly of struggling hard in  their path, through these two attributes alone, we can adorn ourselves with  high moral virtues and excellence of character. Only then can we fit to receive  the promised vicegerency of Allah Ta’ala and His kingdom on earth, which are  bound to come as is promised in the Holy Quran:\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

The work in that region, has not yet reached  the final stage; the progress of the local Muslims, however, has been quite  marked. The blessing and benefits of the system of “Tahligh” are clearly  visible and worth witnessing. If all Muslims collectively resolve to follow the  noble example mentioned above and adopt the correct system of life, as  described in this book, there is every hope that, through that effort, Allah Ta’ala  may obviate all our miseries and adversities and we may be able to regain our  faith, the power to do righteous deeds and the resultant honour, dignity and  glory in this life and attain permanent salvation in the . The Muslims can  then set an example for the rest of the world to live in peace, tranquility and  happiness, which is the natural desire of every man on earth.<br>\nAn attempt has been made to explain as early as possible the real  purpose behind the writing of this book, which is to present to the readers the  sketch of a practical way of life, which about thirty years ago had been  initiated and vigorously followed by Hadhrat Maulane Mohammad Ilyas Sahib,  “rahmatullah alaih”. He had in fact dedicated all his life for this sacred  purpose and mission. It is up to us, the Muslims of the present time, to  understand our obligations towards Islam and fulfil them in our own interest  and that of the coming generations and the mankind at large. The way is clear  and well set. Let us begin the march and fix our minds on the final goal, which  is to acquire the pleasure and approval of Allah Ta’ala.</p>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/meri_kismat.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            <div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/wa_aakhir.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

In other words, those who perform the prayer regularly, after believing in the  kalimah, they practically fulfil their promise with Allah, made through the  kalimah; and those who are not regular at the prayer, they practically belie  their promise with Allah, to be His faithful servants; of them said Rasulullah  (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) “Whoever abandoned the prayer intentionally, he  become an infidel”. In another hadith he says, “Whoever gave up the prayer, he  will be raised among Qaaroon, Fir’own, his minister Haamaan, and the famous  hypocrite Ubayy bin Khalaf, on the Day of Resurrection.”<br>\n  to the kalimah, prayer is the most distinguished of all good deeds. It has been  mentioned in the hadith that the first thing brought to account on the Day of  Judgement, will be the prayer. If one’s prayer is perfect in every respect, he  will certainly attain salvation, otherwise he will be deprived of all the boons  and favours of&nbsp; Allah, and will suffer a  great loss. Therefore, one should observe the prayer at the appointed times,  with good wudu and complete devotion, that one may not be raised with the  infidels, and should be delivered from the hell-fire.<br>\nWhatever  is read in the Prayer (that is, ‘Subhaanak-Al-lahumma’ and Attahiyyaat etc),  should be remembered well, that no mistake should occur during the prayer. One  must know the fardh, the sunnah, and all the conditions of prayer, so that it  may be correct, and by having concentration, it should be performed well. <br>\nA  great merit of the prayer is, that all the limbs of a worshipper, namely,  hands, feet, head, waist, nose, forehead, tongue etc., are wholly and solely  devoted to Allah, that is, every part of a worshipper’s body is engaged in an exercise  of the obedience of Allah’s commandments. If a Muslim performs the prayer with  all its conditions, he is not likely to commit sin by any limb, on times other  than the prayer. It has been mentioned in the Holy Qur’aan that the prayer  prevents a Muslim from shameful and forbidden things. The believers have been  commanded hundreds of times in the Holy Qur’aan to perform the prayer properly.  In the hadith also the prayer has been enjoined and emphasized many a time. For  instance, Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)&nbsp; said, “One’s sins from one prayer to another  are forgiven by Allah”.</p>\nIn another hadith he  says, “If one has a stream at one’s door, and he has a bath in it, five times a  day, he will have no dirt on his body; similarly if one performs the prayer  five times a day, his sins will be pardomed be Allah, and he will be clean of  them”. In another hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) says, “When  your children are seven years old, instruct them to perform the prayer, but  when they are ten years old, beat them to perform the prayer.”\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

There are so many sayings of Rasulullah (Sallallaho  alaihe wasallam) which stress the utility and distinction of these two things.  For instance, a hadith says, “Beware! This world, and whatever is in it, is  cursed by Allah, with the exception of prayers, and zikr, and the religious  scholar, and the religious student”.<br>\nTherefore,  every Muslim should try his best to achieve the high standard of knowledge and  zikr.</p>\n\t\t\t<h2>Knowledge</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Only  that knowledge is appreciated by Allah, which takes a man nearer to Him, and  enables him, to observe His commandments. So much knowledge of the religion of  Islam, as would purify and strengthen one’s faith, is obligatory for every  Muslim man and woman. When a servant of Allah has entirely submitted himself to  Allah, and has promised to observe His commandments, it is indispensable for  him to know all His commandments, and the method of worship. Yes, he should  have a perfect knowledge of prayers, fasting, poor-rate, hajj; of mutual  dealings in everyday life, the true Islamic culture, and other important  aspects of&nbsp; Islamic way of living. Every  Muslim should particularly know those basic things about Islam, the ignorance  of which is likely to commit sins; and when he has got the knowledge of these  things, he must observe them in a practical form, for it has been mentioned in  a hadith, “Verily, the worst punishment of Allah will be inflicted on those on  the Day of Judgement, who have been scholars of religion, but did not practice  it themselves”.</p>\n\t\t\t<h2>The distinction of a scholar and a student</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Rasulullah  (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has said in a hadith, “Anyone who shows the Right  Path to a Muslim, is like one who has already observed Allah’s commandments”.  Another hadith says, “A thousand worshippers are not so annoying and deadly to  Shaytaan, as one person who has achieved perfect knowledge about Islam”.  Another hadith says, “Anyone who died during the period of attaining knowledge  about Islam, his class in Jannah will be only one stage below the Ambiyaa”.  Another hadith says, “The best person among you is he, who has learned the Holy  Qur’an and then teaches it to other Muslims”. Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe  wasallam) says in another hadith, “May Allah keep that person fresh and healthy  who listens to my instructions, and then delivers them to others, exactly as I  have spoken”. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

The highest degree of zikr is that a  believer should be entirely devoted to Allah, and should never forget Him. This  standard of zikr is achieved by constant spiritual edercise, and by continuous  remembrance of Allah. Those who have realized the spiritual benefits of zikr,  they do not neglect it for a single moment of their life. Rasulullah  (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) instructed a companion of his with the remembrance  of Allah”. In another hadith he says, “When some people gather together in an  assembly, and then get up without remembering Allah, be sure that they sat  around the assembly will be a sorrow to them on the Day of Qiyaamah”.<br>\nThe  true believers should remember Allah most often, and by contemplating the  wonders of His creation, they should glorify Him, and thereby strengthen their  love for Him. The more they remember Allah, the better will be their good  deeds, the stronger their faith and knowledge. Then, they will have more and  more love for Allah, and their service to Him will be more sincere and realistic.  Particularly, during the Tabligh journey they should not forget Allah for a  single moment. If all the daily prayers, which are mentioned in the hadith,  viz, prayer at the end of a meeting, prayer for riding an animal (or any other  transport), prayer for entering a new town or a city etc., are remembered well,  and are read on the relevant occasion, naturally the exercise of the  remembrance of Allah can be improved to a great extent. No amount of time is  sufficient for a sacred thing like zikr, yet most spare time should be devoted  to the same; but the least thing that every Muslim can do, is to read the  kalimah, and Durood&nbsp; Sharief, and  Istighfaar (each a complete Tasbeeh) every morning and evening; moreover, a  time should be fixed for the recitation of the Holy Qur’aan. Even some worldly  loss can easily be tolerated for the boundless boons Allah, that are going to  be granted to a believer in the  life!</p>\n\t\t\t<h2>The preference of zikr</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>It  has been mentioned in the hadith that zikr purifies and enlightens the heart.  Another hadith says that nothing saves a Muslim from the chastisement of Allah,  more than zikr. Another Hadith says that amongst the negligent, one who  remembers Allah most often is like a glowing lamp in a dark house. A hadith of  Bukhaari says, “One who remembers Allah, is remembered by Him among His  courtiers (Angels)”. Ralulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) in another hadith  says, “Anyone who remembers Allah most often, is so much preferable to a  person, who distributes a great amount of money in the way of Allah. </p><div align=\"right\">(Targheeb)</div> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\t\t\t</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

That is, whenever a person  intends to do something good, he must not be tempted by some worldly interest,  but should do it purely for the pleasure of Allah, and to have its reward in  the life hereafter. This purity of intention can be achieved only when he has a  firm faith in the reward which Allah and Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe  wasallam) have promised for our good deeds, and, therefore, the hope of this  reward should be our motive in good deeds. That is why Rasulullah (Sallallaho  alaihe wasallam) has said, “The reward for your deeds depends entirely on your  intention, and everyone is paid in accordance with the nature or his  intention”; it means, that it is not merely the action which ensures a reward  from Allah, but it is the sincerity of our intention, which will ensure it. If  an action is void of good intention, and is undertaken for the sake of passion,  or to please men, or to attain some worldly interest, then it is hollow,  lifeless and deserves no reward from Allah. A hadith to this effect sys, “All  the deeds of men will be gathered together before Allah, on the Day of  Qiyaamah; of them only the deeds which are purely done for Allah, will be  separated, and the rest will be thrown into hell”.<br>\n(Targheeb)<br>\nWhen  certain good deeds are done purely for Allah, it is called “Ikhlaas” and  whenever a believer intends to do something based on sincerity, the evil self,  or the Shaytaan cause hinderances in his way. Therefore it is indispensable to  sincerity that one should forsake the worldly temptations, and should believe  in the everlasting boons and favour of the life hereafter. Those who have  realized the value of sincerity, they apply it to their worldly affairs also.  They observe the sincerity of intention in eating, drinking, sleeping, awaking,  walking, earning their living etc., but this standard of sincerity cannot be  achieved without the company of saints and devouts. As an example, our  religious scholars have told us that by observing fasts, if someone desires its  reward and good health at the same time; or, if by undertaking a pilgrimage,  one wishes reward, recreation, and safety from the enemy; or, if by giving alms  to a beggar, one has an intention to have its reward from Allah, appreciation  from the onlookers, and to silence the beggar, then all the above-mentioned  deeds will be void of sincerity. A companion of Rasululla (Sallallaho alaihe  wasallam) asked him, “What is faith?” He replied, “Another name for faith is  sincerity!” (Targheeb). In another hadith Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe  wasallam) says, “Observe sincerity in your deeds, then even a few good deeds  will have the reward of great virtue for you!” (Targheeb). Another companion of  Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) asked him, “One man participates in the  holy war for the sake of riches, and another man participates in it for the  sake of reputation, that he may be called a hero; say, O Messenger of Allah,  who is fighting in the way of Allah?” He answered, “Only that person fights in  the way of Allah, who wants to propagate and establish the truth told by Him  (in the Holy Quran)”. <br>\n(Bukhaari, Muslim)<br>\nThose  who do not desire the pleasure of Allah by their deeds, but wish only the  worldly achievements, they are certainly hypocrites, and this (hypocrisy) is a  disease of the heart, which our spiritualists say, is the root of all evils.  Once Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) said to his companions. “The thing  I fear most in your actions, is smaller polytheism”. His companions asked,  “What is smaller polytheism”. He answered, “Show (of one’s good deeds!)”  Another hadith says, “Whoever made a show of his prayer, or fasting, or  charity, he committed polytheism”. Another hadith says, “There is a pit of  sorrow in Jahannam, of which Jahannam eve3n seeks refuge, of Allah; those  worshippers, who make a show of their worship, will be thrown into it”.</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"

During this stage of life one should exercise the  six  lessons, for a long experience has told us that by sticking to one’s home and  family and the business, one cannot learn or teach the principles of Islam, nor  one can adopt the original and traditional Islamic culture, particularly in  this age of materialism.<br>\nTherefore,  one should get rid of worldly engagements, to serve Allah and His true  religion. In this course, a believer should join the group of the preachers of  Islam, and should call those to the right path, who are lost in this fleeting  world, and have forgotten immortal life hereafter.<br>\nTo  call the wrong doing and negligent people to Allah,and to instruct them with  His commandments, was really the duty or the Ambiyaa, which has now been  entrusted to the Muslims. The true following of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe  wasallam) requires that every Muslim should devote himself to his service, and  should sacrifice everything for the preachment of his true religion (Islam).  Just as Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) himself bore so many troubles  for the sake of Islam, similarly every follower of his should also follow his  footsteps.<br>\nThe  companions of Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had properly realized the  requisites of Tabligh, and, therefore, they tolerated the troubles of this  world, for the sake of the boons and favours of Allah in the  life. They  gladly devoted themselves to the service of Allah, and preferred the needs of  religion to the needs of worldly life. Sometimes, they ate leaves, or a single  date, and walked barefoot on long journeys, in the way of Allah. During the  time of the Sahabah it was necessary to propagate Islam, and to spread it far  and wide, but today we have to revive it; just as those believers performed  their duty by the sacrifice of their lives, we should also follow their  example.<br>\nLeaving  one’s home and family for the cause of Allah, has great rewards for the  subject, in the  life, just as Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has  clearly told us.<br>\n&nbsp;Rasulullah (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) has  said, “Whoever spends his morning or evening the way of Allah, his reward will  be much better than the whole world, and whatever is in it.” (Bukhaari and  Muslim). In another hadith he says, “The fire of Jahannam will not reach anyone  whose feet become dusty whilst he is on the path of Allah.”<br>\nWhen  we instruct the servants of Allah with His commandments, it means we have  fulfilled the duty of Tabligh, and have received it, for Rasulullah (Sallallaho  alaihe wasallam) has said, “When people see others committing sins and do not  prevent them from the same, soon Allah will inflict a punishment on them, which  will affect the common folk, as well as the distinguished persons”.<br>\nA  hadith of Tirmizi Sharief says, “I swear by Allah, you must command people with  good deeds, and prevent them from forbidden things, or soon Allah will inflict  a severe punishment to you, and then your prayers even will not be heard by  Him!”<br>\nA  verse of the Holy Qur’aan says,</p>\n\t\t\t<div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/arabic/scan0002.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“There  must be a group among you, who should invite people to good, and should induce  them to legal things, and should prevent them from illegal things; and  certainly these will attain salvation”.<br>\n\t\t\t  Another  verse says,</p>\n\t\t\t<div align=\"center\"><div class=\"arabic-image-container\"><img src=\"images/dua/8_six_fundamentals/scan0002a.gif\" class=\"arabic-img\" alt=\"Arabic Text\" /></div></div>\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“O  Muslims! You are the best nation, who has been chosen for the guidance of other  nations; you command people with virtue, and prevent them from vice, and have a  firm faith in Allah!”<br>\n\t\t\t  It  has been reported by Abu Darda (Radhiyallaho anho) that Rasulullah (Sallallaho  alaihe wasallam) said, “You must induce people to good deeds, and prevent them  from bad ones, otherwise Allah will bring such a tyrant sovereign over you, who  will not respect your elders, nor will he show mercy to your youngsters; then  the prayers of your pious people even will not be granted by Allah; if you  called Him, He will not pardon you!”</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table></div>"
