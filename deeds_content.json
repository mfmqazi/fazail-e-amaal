        "title": "Good Intention",
        "content": "Intention is an alchemic prescription that can turn base dirt into noble gold. The hadith says \"All actions depends upon intentions.\" It is sometimes interpreted to mean that good intentions justify bad deeds too and turn sins meritorious. This is entirely wrong. Sin is always a sin no matter how noble the intention may be. For instance if someone breaks into a house to steal with the intention of giving away as alms whatever he would steal would be a thief deserving the prescribed punishment. His good intentions would not earn hire any merit nor would his sin be pardoned. What this hadith means is as follows: 1. A good deed earns merit only if done with right intention. For instance prayer would earn merit only when one prays only for Divine pleasure: if one prays to impress others, then, instead of earning merit, it would earn punishment. 2. The second interpretation which is germane to the present discussion is that all lawful deeds actually earn neither merit nor punishment, but if these are done with good intent, they become acts of worship and earn merit. For instance eating is lawful: but if one eats with the intention that food shall give hire energy and that energy lie shall spend in the service of Allah, the act of eating would earn merit. Similarly if one eats with the intent that his physical beady too has its rights and dues which include nourishment through eating or if one eats with the intent of getting pleasure and taste and of thanking Allah for these, the eating become an act of merit. There is no lawful deed of life, which if done with good intent, does not become act of merit. A few instances shall elucidate the point further: (a) Honest earning, whether by trade or service or industry or agriculture, if done with the intent of rightly fulfilling the duties enjoined by Allah toward oneself and one's family, would become an act of merit. Then if one further intends to spend whatever he may save after fulfilling the needs of himself and his family in helping the poor and in other similar good deeds, he would earn further merit. (b) When a person engaged in learning intends to serve the humanity through his knowledge he would go on earning merit as long as he remains engaged in acquisition of knowledge. For instance a student of religion may decide to propagate the faith, a medical student to alleviate human suffering due to disease, an engineering student to serve his people through his specialized knowledge etc. all these acts would become acts of merit because of the intention which motivates the doer. [Arabic Text Image] A man, knowing that sustenance and subsistence is the responsibility of Allah which He shall fulfil without fail, engages in a particular profession or vocation with a view to serve humanity, his profession would earn him merit. For instance if someone enters the medical profession consciously choosing it from among other professions in order to cure the sick, be would earn merit even if he charges for his services. Such a man would not hesitate to provide free treatment for the poor and the destitute. A cloth merchant who enters this profession to provide clothes to people because clothing oneself is a religious duty, would also earn merit. Similarly a government servant, motivated by a desire to serve the common man and fulfil his needs, would earn merit. \"Thus, every profession, becomes meritorious, provided the intention is right.\" [Arabic Text Image] If one dresses in finery not to show off his status or wealth, but to afford pleasure to others, it is an act of merit. [Arabic Text Image] If one treats his children with love because it is a sunnah of our eternally blessed Prophet, it earns him merit. [Arabic Text Image] If one does the household chores because this too is a sunnah as our eternally blessed Prophet helped in the housework, its merit rewards in the Afterlife. [Arabic Text Image] Loving conversation with wife and children is a sunnah and the eternally blessed Prophet has so ordained, hence such an act is also meritorious if done to follow the sunnah. (g) Hospitality to guests, if shown in pursuance of sunnah is an act of merit. (h) Planting a sapling or plant in the house so that it may one day be of use of some man or animal and please the onlooker would be a good deed. (i) Writing a beautiful and legible hand to make it easy for the reader to read is an act of merit. [Arabic Text Image] If a woman dresses herself in beautiful raiment and wears ornaments and adorns herself to please her husband and if a man remains clean and neat to please his wife, both are good deeds. [Arabic Text Image] If permissible recreation is indulged in to the extent needed to prepare oneself for duties it is a meritorious act. (1) If a watch is kept to know prayer timings and to realize the value of time which is intended to be spent in good deeds, it is an act that earns merit. There are a few common examples from everyday life which can earn much merit for the doer, Imam Ghazali has rightly observed in his 1hya'- al-'ulum that there is no lawful action in human life which, if done with the right intent, cannot be changed into an act of merit. Even if husband and wife give mutual pleasure to each other, each with the intent of giving the other his or her due and making them pure this too would give them merit."

        "content": "Allah likes his bondsmen to pray to Him. If a man, however munificent he may be, is again and again asked for anything, he sooner or later loses his patience and becomes angry. But Allah, on the contrary, is, pleased the more his bondsmen ask him. Hadith tells as that Allah is displeased with one who does not ask him for anything in prayer. Praying is not only a means of realizing one's purposes but is, in itself, an act or worship. In other words praying even for one's personal ends and worldly needs is counted among acts of worship and earns merit. The more one prays the closer one gets to Allah. It is not necessary to pray only in times of need or of &stress: rather, praying in times of pleasure and plenty is also necessary. A hadith tells us that one who desires his prayers in the times of sorrow and distress to be answered, should pray in times of happiness and plenty. (Tirmidhi cited in h i ' a1 UsulJ Allah has promise in Qur'an 'Pray to Me and I &all fulfill it\". Ths Divine promise can never be wrong so one must pray with Belief and trust in its fulfillment. But Nfillment can take different forms; sometimes one gets what he prays for, but sometimes the desired object is not regarded by Allah as beneficial or useful to his bondsman and so he is granted something better in this life or Hereafter. Thus every act of praying has three advantages: 1. Divine grant of prayers fulfills our desires; 2. Every prayer earns merit; and 3. Repeated acts of praylng bring one ever closer to Allah Although the correct method of praying is to face the Qiblah and raise one's hands and pray with tongue, prefacing the prayer with praise of Allah and darud, but one can also pray without these preliminaries too. Thus Allah has made the act of praying so easy that one can also, pray almost anywhere and at any time; one can pray while engaged in any activity and if one cannot intone the prayer as e.g. in lavatory, one can think his prayer. Also it is not necessary to pray for big or important things; one should pray to Allah asking him to fulfil all one's wants, big or small; hadith tells us to pray even when one breaks his bootless (Tirmidhi). Consequently one should develop the habit of asking Allah to fulfil even the smallest need, to seek Divine amelioration of the most ordinary trouble. Just a child calls his mother for everything big or small, one should call and go on calling Allah. No matter what work one may be engaged in, one should always ask Allah for something or the other. Cultivate this habit and see how quickly you rise."

        "content": "SUNNAH Although one should pray to Allah at all times for all one's needs, our eternally blessed Prophet has taught us some specific prayers for special occasions at different times of night and day, e.g. upon waking up, when going to the toilet and coming out of it, when performing ablution, upon entering and coming out of the mosque, upon entering the house, before meals and after meals hearing the adhan, when dressing, when looking in mirror, before falling asleep in bed. These prayers are all-embracing and extremely useful for all our worldly and other-worldly needs. We, by ourselves, can never think of such prayers which the eternally blessed Prophet has taught us. These prayers are not time consuming nor ablution is their precondition nor is one to raise his hands. If one commits them to memory, one reaps a very rich harvest both here and in the Hereafter. Hence every Muslim must commit these prayers to memory. There are many books wherein they are listed. Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi's \"Munajat-e- Maqbul\" has most of them. You should commit them to memory and ask your children to memorize them too. PRAYING FOR OTHERS. One prays for one's own needs and desires, but one should also pray for one's relatives, friends and Muslims in general as it is an act of great merit. There is a hadith which says that when a Muslim prays for anyone of his brothers in faith in the latter's absence angels pray for the same for him. (Sahih Muslim). Hence if you come to know that any Muslim is in trouble or need, pray for him. In fact one should I pray for the unbelievers too so that they may be I Divinely guided on to the path of Islam. Thus one gets merit for We act of praying as well as for wishing well for others."

        "title": "Dhikr (Remembrance) of Allah",
        "content": "Dhikr i.e. mental or verbal remembrance of Allah is so consoling, pleasant and easy form of worship that one can perform it continuously at all times and with great benefit, Allah has enjoined His Dhikr in the Quran in the following words: Obviously dhikr does not benefit Allah, Who has no need of in the benefit is for Allah's bondsmen since dhikr strengthens the bond between Allah and His bondsmen, is food for the soul which invigorates it. And with an invigorated soul it becomes easy to overcome one's base instincts and to vanquish the Devil. Thus one is able more easily to avoid sins and the good deeds increase. Someone asked our eternally blessed Prophet 'Which worship is highest, in the Eyes of Allah and which shall be reckoned weightiest on the Day of Judgement?\" The Prophet replied \"Dhikr of Allah\" (Jami'al Usul, p. 475 Vol. 4) A companion once submitted to the eternally blessed Prophet '0 Messenger of Allah! Good deeds are many and I do not have the strength to perform all of them. So please tell vie one thing that I may always remember. Please do not tell me niany things as I would forget them.\" The Holy Prophet said \"Your tongue should he wet with dhikr of Allah\". (Jami Tirmidhi, Dawat Bab Fad1 a1 Dhikr). Abu Musa Ash'ari has been quoted as follows: The eternally blessed Prophet said \"A house wherein Allah is remembered and a house wherein He is not remembered are like living and dead bodies\" (Bukhari and Muslim) Another hadith quotes our Prophet as follows: \"People who leave a meeting or conclave without mentioning and remembering Allah are like those who get off from a dead ass, and such a meeting they would repent (for time misspent] on the Day of Judgement\" (Abu Da'ud) That's why a hadith tells us to recite the following worlds at the end of every meeting or This atones for the sh-ortcomings of the meeting. In spite of the great merits of dhikr. Allah has made it very easy. There are no preconditions attached to it. If someone performs ablution and then sits facing Qibla and performs dhikr it is all for the best. But if there is no time or occasion for it then one can perform dhikr while engaged in other works, even ablution is not required and dhikr is permitted even when unclean after coition or while menstruating. However one should not perform it verbally when unclothed or when in some unclean place like lavatory. However even there dhikr can be done without intoning or moving the tongue. Thus the merits of this worship can be reaped at all times without any difficulty. However it is appropriate to fix a particular time in the night or the day when one can perform dhikr after ablution and facing the qiblah; dhikr at other times would be an added boon. For special dhikr the following books may be consulted. 1. Fada'il-al-Dhikr by Shaikh a1 Hadith Hadrat Maulana Muhammad Dhakariyya. 2. Dhikr Allah by Maulana Mufti Muhammad Shafi. 3. Ma'mulat-e-Yaumiyah by Dr. Abdul Hai Arifi However some brief adhkar are given below which should be recited continuously. 1. Hadith quotes our eternally blessed Prophet as saying that \"The following four phrases are most pleasing to Allah. (Sahih Muslim) 2.

Hadith tells us that if one recites these words in the morning he gets merit equivalent to freeing of ten slaves from among the progeny of Prophet of Islam, he gets ten good deeds recorded in his name, his ten sins are pardoned he is elevated by ten stages and is protected against the Devil till evening. And if he recites these words in the evening; he gets the same reward till morning (Abu Da'ud)."

        "content": "Allah bestows countless boons on me on every instant; they are countless as Allah Himself says in the Qur'an: % ,J.,J=$; bw-9, 1-3 Shaikh Sa'di has said that if one ignores other boons and mercies, life itself is a boon of highest order, in so fir as the act of breathing itself has two boons of inhalation and exhalation; if breath, goes in and does not came out it is death and if breath goes out and does not cone in it is again death. Hence every breath has two boons for which Allah must be thanked. However even if one thanks Allah once with every breath, it is still insufficient; so how can one adequately thank Allah for other boons and mercies? Though it is impossible to thank Allah adequately, but thanking Him to the best of ones ability is a pleasing to Allah and earns countless merits, and also leads to the grant of further boons and mercies, one also get closer to Allah as he has said: 4 /, ,,a: / a d [Arabic Text Image] [Arabic Text Image] * < urss;)t> 3>c1>u+;t &fi$b In another place, He says: Allah likes a thankful bondsman and dislikes a thankless one, since thanklessness is extreme narrow mindedness. A thankless person laments even slightest troubles and ignores the countless mercies and boons; he is more aware of his troubles than of his comforts, A thankful person, on the contrary is thankful,, even in direst troubles, for the innumerable boons he enjoys, while praying, for deliverance from his troubles. Suppose a person is sick. If he is thankless, he would ignore all other blessings, regard himself as the most troubled and aggrieved person in the world and lament his fate. But if he is a thankful man he would think of the healthful period of his life and then he would think of his treatment of and the presence of his well- wishers and friends as mercies, he would think of people more sick than himself and thank Allah for sparing him more serious sickness, He would pray for his recovery but not by way of complaint, he would pray as a besieger and pleader. He would never utter anything smacking of thanklessness. Devil assails man by first making him ungrateful. The Qur'an tells us that when Devil was granted leave till the Day of Judgment he said that he would mislead Allah's bondsmen in every way and he further said: This shows that Devil's greatest desire is to make Allah's bondsmen thankless so that they may be bereft of the worship of thankfulness. But if someone is determined to be thankful, he is spared Devil's guile and wile. Thus thankfulness to Allah is a supreme act of worship which requires only a few moments. ' :/ # & l ~ ~ l ~ * ~ ~ ; s ~ 4 # # ' He who thanks Allah after eating earns the same merit as one who fasts and desists from eating. (Bukhari and Tirmidhi) Consequently, one must thank Allah for all his boons and mercies, whether big or small. One should thank Allah when on returning home, he finds his family safe and well, when he eats f=od when his hot brow is fanned by cool breeze, when he sees his child happily at play; in other words everything which pleases and comforts should be acknowledged with thanks to the One Allah who is the Real and the Ultimate Source and intone his thanks, he should do it in his heart. Saints and learned ones have also instructed that upon going to bed and before falling asleep, one should think of Allah's gifts and boons and thank Him for every one of them. For instance, one should think of the good health of his family and himself; of the house which he lives in, of the comfortable bed he sleeps in, of his own safety and that of his family and thank Allah for these Divine mercies before closing his eyes in sleep. Real and true thankfulness to Allah implies changing ones ways to into those that please the Almighty, but if one merely expresses his thankfulness in his heart or by mouth, it too is an act of great worship. This can lead to a change for the better in other deeds. While there are no specific wards prescribed for showing one's gratitude to Allah and He can be thanked in any language, our exalted and eternally blessed Prophet has taught us some compressive words to express our gratitude to our Maker; these are given below. &j!*;ggq,;,$&pJi&p& a,/' [Arabic Text Image] ' [Arabic Text Image] / [Arabic Text Image] 4 ' Bd 4 3 4 & . % m a w r J & ~ ~ + & - # , # , N J , ~ &p3,&j;~,34~3.='r'.bl+G << -4 'rC3&j&$jr;&* 1.0 Allah!l thank Thee with a thankfulness that is eternal with Thine Own Eternal Being.

Whatever boon I or anyone of Thine creatures get is from Thee only; there is none coeval with Thee hence all praise and all gratitude are for Thee alone.

        "content": "Allah has created three worlds: one of complete bliss and comfort without any shadow of grief or pain which is Paradise; the second of pain and grief without any shadow of bliss or comfort; which is Ohell; and then there is the third world where bliss and grief and pain and comfort coexist, and this one is our present world. Consequently, there has never been nor can ever be, a man who has not at some time in his life tasted sorrow. Man, however rich or pious or powerful he may be, would experience pleasure as well as pain; even Allah's chosen messengers have suffered in this world. Hence, one who wants to be wholly and permanently free of sorrow and pain does not know the nature of this world and this desire of his can never be fulfilled. Of course, the measures of pleasure and pain may vary, but complete and permanent freedom from pain is impossible. It is thus obvious that every one of us is visited by sorrow and pain in one form or the other. So if his lot impatient and frantic and laments his fate and bewails his lot it would not rid him of pain and sorrow. Such a behavior would, one the one hand,, exacerbate the feeling of pain and sorrow, and, on the other hand, his impatience would be of grave disadvantage to him in so far as the pain and sorrow which could earn him merit and reward would remain barren. In contrast to this, there is a man who in times of pain and sorrow thinks of the brevity of mundane life and the inevitability of pain and then thinks that whatever Allah does has some Divine Design which man cannot unravel. This man then does not lament his lot nor does he complain; rather his faith in Allah and His doings is strengthened since whatever Allah does he believes Him to change his pain and sorrow into pleasure and comfort and to save him from such plights in future. This way of thought is \"patience\". Patience has the advent age that it brings solace and banishes dismay. Moreover the pain and sorrow thus become causes for boundless reward and merit since Allah says : Please note that sorrowing and worrying in times of trouble and trial are not sins, even weeping is sudden shock is not a sin, nor is it an act o impatience. Impatience is to criticize Allah and to lament and complain. Patience is to hold firm to one's faith in Allah even when h s whole world is crumbling into rains and heart is heavy with grief anti ewes are brimming with tears. It is this patience for which has been promised boundless reward. One sign of patience is to repeatedly say: For those who recite these words in times of trial and tribulation. Allah has said: Consequently our saints and learned men have rightly said that patience is equal to a thousand acts of worship and it leads to man's spiritual elevation. It does not require any major catastrophe for one to show patience and recite: in everyday life there are many minor pinnipeds which should be countered with the recitation of this ayah. Umme Salma has quoted our Holy Prophet as saving that \"When someone of you is afflicted by some pain or is troubled. A hadith tells tis that once when a lamp went out our Holy Prophet recited this ayah. This clearly shows that must be recited when assailed by even minor troubles, and similarly patience should be exercised even in everyday problems and worries so that one gets merit of an act of worship. A sudden stumble, a prick of a thorn, failure of electric power, a bad news, a loss, all should be met with a recital of and it should be firmly believed that some Divine Purpose is at work behind every unpleasant event. This is true patience that ways earns immense amount of merit. Another point to be remembered is that just as shedding tears over some grievous event is not contrary to patience, trying to ameliorate one's lot and remove e the cause of pain and sorrow tone is not against the practice of patience. Seeking employment when unemployed obviously does not run counter to the practice of patience. One should try to better one's condition ana also go on praying to Allah. Groaning due to pain is also not contrary to patience. The reality of patience is, as described above, not criticizing or bewailing any Divine decision, and reciting. This recital is simple and brief but it earns immeasurable reward and merit."

A Muslim and an unbeliever both carry out the daily routines of life but there is immense difference between the two: the unbeliever does everything in a state of unawareness, while a Muslim does whatever he has to do by consciously accepting and realizing the fact that nothing can be accomplished without Divine Will Help and Pleasure. This realization change worldly acts into acts of devotion to, and worship of Allah. The advantages of reciting Bismillah have been discussed in detail in \"Bismillah kay Fadail-o-Masa'il\" by the author's father Maulana Mufti Muhammad Shafi: its study shall be of great benefit."

        "content": "Greeting brother Muslims is one of these Islamic practices which are hallmark of a Muslim and its merits have been anointed in many ahadith. e.g. \"One who takes pretence in greeting others is closer to Allah\". (Abu Daud ) It is not necessary to greet only those with whom one is acquainted; greeting strangers who are known to be Muslims is a matter of great merit Our holy Prophet, may lie be Divine, blessed eternally, was asked as to which action are good for Muslims. Among the actions which our holy Prophet enumerated was this: \"You should greet people whether you know their or not\" (Sahih Bukhari. Sahih Muslim) It is reported about Abdullah bin Omar that sometimes he went out of the house only to greet any Muslims he met and thus to increase his merit. (Muvatta Imam Malik) The correct interpretation of this hadith, however, is that one should greet others, though not everyone one sees because it is impossible and it might also be embarrassing for others. (A1 Adab a1 Shariah, li ibn Muslih page 422, volume 1) It is also a sunnah to greet the family when entering the house. Our holy Prophet instructed his personal servant Anas as follow: \"0 son! When you enter (your) house, greet your family member; this act shall be of benefit for both you and your family members\" (Tirmidhi) Even when entering an empty house one should greet with the intent that angels are being greeted. Abdullah ibn Omar used to say : , ,0/0,/04@, ~ L ~ I & I ~ L E & , ~ X ~ ~ &.. / . I on such occasions (A1 Adalf al Shariah li ibn Muslih, p.424, vol.1) Hadith also urges the muslims to clearly speak out the greeting so that it may be heard and understood. Although the sunnah of greeting to fulfilled by saylng \"A1 Salam Alaikum \". but adding \"wa Rahmat ulla-wa barakatuhu\" earns more merit. Imran bin Husayn recounts that once he and others were in the presence of our exalted and eternally blessed Prophet when a man came and said: -&WV \"As-salamo alaikum\", to which the blessed Prophet responded and said \"Ten\" (i.e. the person who had greeted him, had earned ten merits); GLdb then another man came and he said, \\ i ) .\\ 'Xssalamo alazkum wa Rahmatullah\", to which the blessed Prophet responded and said 'Twenty' (i.e. the man had earned twenty merits); finally a thira man came and said salamo alaikum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuhu\"), to which the exalted Prophet responded and said 'Thirty\" (i.e. he had earned thirty merits) (Abu Daud, Tirmidhi, Jami a1 Usul, p. 602. vol. 6j, It should be noted here, however, that salam i.e. greeting is a sunnah only when the person greeted is not busy or when salam would not disturb him; if salam is going to disturb him in whatever he is doing, e.g. reciting Qur'an or doing dhikr or tending the sick or studying or doing something else in which loss of concentration would cause loss, the one should wait till the work is finished. Similarly it is not right to salaam when somebody is making a speech, and speaker too should not do it. However if a group is sitting quietly and somebody passes by then he should greet them; if someone wishes to join them then just one salaam is enough and single response from one of the group fulfills the sunnah . To be the first with salam is sumah and he who does not reply to it is a sinner. When a letter is received in whichif@t'5 I 'salaam alaikum\" is written, it should be responded to in the prescribed manner while reading the letter."

Some jurists regard it vajib, but in fact it is a sunnah. Thauban relates that our Holy and eternally blessed Prophet has said that \"when a Muslim visits his sick brother in faith, he is all the time in the garden of Paradise. (Kitab al Birr wa a1 Silah and Tirmidhi. Kitabal-Khabaiz) Ali has said that he heard our Holy Prophet saying that \"When a Muslim goes to visit another ailing Muslim in the morning, seventy thousand angels pray for his forgiveness till evening, and if he goes visiting till the evening, seventy thousand angels pray for his forgiveness till morning and he is granted a garden in the Paradise\". (Tirmidhi. Kitab a1 KhabaiZ. Hadith 969). Our exalted and eternally blessed Prophet, hearing of sickness of anyone among his acquaintances, went to visit him. The correct way of visiting the sick is to put one's hand on the sick man's forehead and inquire after his illness, but only if putting the hand on his forehead does not cause the sick one pain otherwise it is sufficient to ask how he was. Out exalted Prophet has taught us the following prays which is to be recited seven time when visiting the sick:- [Arabic Text Image] -, . [Arabic Text Image] , *-, This prayer heals the sick, provided his time of death has not come. Our holy Prophet also used to recite the following prayers several times while visiting the sick:- : ,., ' , ?, [Arabic Text Image] 0 [Arabic Text Image] I /,, [Arabic Text Image] ~&.dJ3&y 36.j3;6L3J and also said r: . [Arabic Text Image] 0 ' . / 3 1 ; ~ ~ ~ ),&cry9 , It should be remembered that the visitors actions should never cause the slightest trouble or pain to sick and this has been emphasized more than visiting the sick. A visit which pains or trouble the sick would be a sin rather than act of merit. Thus if visitors are not allowed to see the patient, they must not visit; in such a case mere asking and praying for the patient become an act of merit. There is no need to have one's visit reported to the sick man. But if it is intended to please the patient then the names of the visitors may be told to him at sonic appropriate time Hadith has also emphasized that visitor must not stay very long with the sick man because it might harm the patient. However, if the patient wants someone intimate to stay with him then there is no harm in staying long. It is also necessary to choose the right time for the visit; it is not right to visit a patient when he is resting or is otherwise engaged. Hence it is better to find out beforehand the appropriate time for a visit."

'To love for the sake of Allah\" means loving someone, not for any worldly gain, but because he is more religious and I pious or he is very learned in din or is busy in serving the cause of din or because loving him or her is commanded by Allah, e.g. one's parents. li Such a love has been called \"love for Allah\" in &adith. F i One hadith says: i Allah shall ask on the Day of Judgment, \"Where i are those who loved for the sake of My Greatness? Today when there is no shade save Mine, 1 shall have i them in My Shade\" [Sahih Muslim: Kitab a1 Birr wa a1 t Silah) I Another tells us that 'On the Day of Judgment. Those who had mutual love for the sake of Allah's Greatness shall be on pulpits of light and all shall envy them (Jami' Tumidhi, Kitab al Zuhd) Abu Idris Khulani, one of the famous fabi'in says that once he visited Muadh ibn Jabal in the mosque of Damascus and told him that \"By Allah I love you for the sake of Allah\". He repeatedly asked me to swear if it was so and when 1 answered in affirmative every time he pulled me by my shawl and said 'Hear the good news! 1 have heard the exalted and blessed Messenger of Allah saying that 'My love shall certainly be for those who love each other for my sake, who sit in each other's company for my sake, who go to meet each other for my sake and spend money on each other for my sake.\" (Muvatta Imam Malik, Kitab-al- Shirr). Having love for Allah's pious and good bondsmen is actually an outcome of one's love for Allah, so it earns the same rewards and merits as the latter, because of this love. Allah includes His lover in His beloved people. According to a hadith, someone asked our blessed and exalted Prophet\".

Anas has recounted that someone was sitting with our Holy Prophet when another one passed. The sitting one said ' 0 Messenger of Allah! 1 love this man\".

(Abu Daud and Nisari) Once a man asked the Holy Prophet for something; the Messenger of Allah turner! to others and said \"Recommend hm, so that may you earn merit (Bukhari Kitab a1 Adab). A good recommendation, whether affective or ineffective, is in itself a good deed. If it is effective then it might carp double merit. But it should be noted that the recommendation should be for some correct purpose and not for any unlawful purpose because recommendation for some thing unlawful is a grave sin with graver consequences. Hence it is necessary to be absolutely sure that the person recommended is truly deserving of it, and whatever he is being recommended for is justified and lawful. Another point to be noted is that the recommendation should not unduly burden the person to whom the recommendation is being made, first of all it must be assessed if the person is really able to do what is recommended; if not, then recommendation should not be made as it might embarrass hire. If one cannot know whether the person to which recommendation is made is able to act on it or not, then recommendation should not be pressing and one should ask for the work to be done if it can be done. Sometimes even when a person is able to do something, he still has to follow some rules or preferences of his own. In such a case too one should not make specific recommendation but leave it to the person to do it according to his rules and preferences so that he may not be unduly burdened. Nowadays recommendation is made for the sake of its merit in the hereafter but its riles as formulated by shari'ah are not observed. Especially, people do not consider the trouble they may cause to the person to whom recommendation is being made. Remember that there are rules for everything in shariah which have to be followed; it is not at all permissible to unduly trouble anyone even for the sake of another Muslim."

If the guidance towards good is in the form of a collective effort, i.e. many persons are guided and consequently do good, the reward of the good deeds of all goes to the guide also (in addition to the rewards clue to actual doers). Abu Hurairah recounts that our Holy Prophet said:, One who calls others to the right path of good I deeds gets as much merits as those who act upon his guidance, and the merits of the doers arc not reduced thereby.

Hence no opportunity of giving good advice to and guiding others should be lost, but care should be taken to adopt a method for this which is not insulting or irksome to the other man. One should not criticize others in Public nor should one adopt an overbearing anti proud stance, advice should be given in privacy and in a soft tune showing one's sympathy anti cornifications hence one should chose a time for advice when the hearer is not worried.

Qur'an and hadith too are replete with the merits of spending money as sadaqah and in charity: in fact one can do justice to this topic in a book only. Shaikh a1 hadith Maulana Mohammed Zakaria Kandhalvi has written a book \"Kitab a1 Sadaqat\" which is indeed an excellent encyclopedic work on this topic. Hence there is no need to describe in detail the merits of sadaqah and charity: those who desire can consult this book. What we wish to bring to the reader's attention here is that it is not at all necessary to spend overmuch to gain merit; one has to spend only as much as he can afford. If one has only a Rupee and lie spends one paisa on some good work it is as if a man with a hundred thousand rupees spends a thousand. Allah does not care for human wealth; Allah values the purity of intent. Maximum sadaqah with pure intent is as much pleasing to Allah as great spending, and cams much merit anti reward. Our exalted and blessed Prophet has said: -29:::. , /,,: 0-< [Arabic Text Image] d3 JUI 19) \"Escape the fire of hell he it by the length of half a date\" (Sahih Bukhari - Sahih Muslim) This hadith means that if one has nothing save half a slate, and he gives to another who needs it, it too would a sadaqah and would earn merit and lead to Divine pardon. This hadith also clearly shows that the poor should not think that they cannot earn merit through sadaqah: by spending whatever they can afford, they tots can cam this merit. There are some who, after paying zakat, believe that they have done all that is required from them and do not spent a paisa more; this is not justified. Zakat is a duty and the money is to be spent for very specific purposes only. There are many other good deeds which lie outside the imbed of Zakat e.g. contributing to mosque fund. Hence some money over and above Zakat should be spent on outer good deeds too. Our spiritual elders anti saints always set aside a certain portion of their incomes for charitable purposes. Maulana Thanvi always reserved one-fifth of his income for this, others reserved one-tenth or one-twentieth part. The advantage of this practice is that whenever the occasion arises, the money is already set aside and available; this availability is also a reminder. If everyone regularly sets aside some part of his income, he can easily earn much merit and reward: Sadaqah and Khairat (charity) should have only one purpose, viz. obtaining the pleasure of Allah. Those who give away money for these purpose arc amply rewarded by Allah in this world too. Hadith tells us than \"Sadaqah does not reduce wealth:"

The holy Qur'an says: * J 4 , ; /. ,.: J /,: [Arabic Text Image] ,/,*, ,<*,', && ul*c)lc)3yy~ IJ+d,I+, There is none in this world who is entirely innocent and has never done wrong or committed a mistake, and everyone craves Allah's pardon. Therefore, when someone makes a mistake the aggrieved person should think ofhimself as a seeker of Divine pardon and forgive the wrong doer. The above ayah indicates that a forgiving person can expect Divine forgiveness for his own faults and misdeeds. There are many other ahadith of the same purport: e.g. Abu Darda' relates that our exalted and blessed Prophet has said that:- ''If a person is given physical pain and he forgives it, Allah the Highest elevates his rank and pardons his sins\" One reads in Jami' Tirmidhi that someone had broken a person's tooth, and the assaulted person came to Amir Mu'awiyah's court to obtain redress. There Abu Darda related to him the above Hadith and he gave up the idea of revenge and forgave his assaulter (Jmi' Tirmidhi: kitab a1 Diyat: Hadith 1412) The point to ponder is that if the aggrieved person does not forgive and gets his due revenge, what shall this revenge achieve:' If the injury inflicted is such that it cannot be avenged then not forgiving it would cause the one who inflicted the injury to suffer in the Hereafter. Here one should stop and think how another one's suffering in the Hereafter would benefit the one aggrieved or in injured in this world. Forgiveness here, on the contrary, brings abeut Divine forgiveness for the forgiver, and escape from hell, and Allah the Highest shall pardon his sins. Reason, therefore, tells us to exercise forgiveness. Forgiveness, it should be borne in mind, means here that no revenge is to be sought in this world or in the Hereafter. Such a forgiveness earn much merit. However it is not necessary that the act of forgiving is followed by rapprochement. The latter is involuntary not forced and depends largely upon the future behaviors of the other person. Thus if one forgives anti yet has mental reserves towards the aggressor or transgressor and is unable to maintain cordial rcaltions with him save in the matter of rights (salaam etc.) he too shall earn merit for his forgiveness. Forgiveness also does not imply letting down one's guard against any future aggression. If such an aggression is feared then any step that is taken to safeguard oneself against it is not contrary to forgiveness. In such a case if the previous wrong is pardoned and help, even official help is sought against future wrong doing. This too would not detract from the merit earned for earlier forgiveness. When the urge to avenge oneself upon the wrongdoer awakens, one must pause long enough to reflect that our Holy and Revered Prophet never avenged himself upon anyone. Even when the unbelievers stoned him and blood flowed from his face. He said: ''Oh Allah' Forgive my people. as they do not know\" (Sahih Bukhari Sahih Muslim)"

Few know, however, that this effort too is an act of great merit in the eyes of Allah. According to Abu Hurairah, our Holy Prophet said that \"There is one dinar which you spend in the way of Allah (for jihad), another is that you spend on freeing a slave, another is that which you give a poor man by way of charity, and there is another dinar which you spend on your family (wife and children), the dinar that you spend on your wife and children has the highest merit\" (Sahih Muslim). The reason why spending on one's own family is superior to other spending's is that providing for one's family is a duty (fard), while other arc by way of nafl in nature; obviously fard earns more merit than nag. It also makes the point that spending on one's family has more merit when the family is needy, but when their needs are fulfilled in the proper way, then it is more meritorious to spend on others. Umme Salmah once asked our eternally blessed Prophet ' 0 Messenger of Allah! Do 1 earn mexit even when I spend on my sons from my previous husband Abu Salmah'! They are after all my sons and I cannot abandon them\". The Holy Prophet replied \"Yes you shall get merit for it\". Sa'ad ibn Waqqas relates, that our eternally blessed Prophet said that: \"Whatever you spend for the sake of earning Pleasure of Allah - even for the food you put in your wife's mouth - earns merit\" (Bukhari, Muslim) All these ahadith clearly prove that if one spends money to fulfil the lawful needs of his family with the intent of giving them their Divinely ordained rights as commanded by Allah and of pleasing Allah, then every expenditure urns him the same merit as sadaqah. Behold how infinitely kind and-gracious is Allah that what one does solely to satisfy his own inner urges has been changed by a slight change of intent into an act of such merit that it has become superior to all other sadaqah and expenditures. Hence to please Allah, one should openly spend to fulfill the lawful needs of one's family and should never regret it."

        "content": "PARENTS Good treatment of parents has been very much emphasized in the Qur'an as well as ahadith. Parents have priority in matter of human rights and also they have more rights them others. For instance read the following verses of the Qur'an: S / / # / + / [Arabic Text Image] ,,,,, [Arabic Text Image] / / [Arabic Text Image] And serve Allah. Ascribe nothing as partner unto him. Show kindness unto parents. Abdullah ibn Mas'ud relates \"Once I asked holy Messenger of Allah - may he be eternally blessed - what action pleased Allah most. He replied 'To pray at the right time\". 1 asked \"What is the next action\"\" He said \"Good treatment of one's parents.\" I asked \"What is the next actionur' He said \"Jihad in the way of Allah\". (Bukhari and Muslim) Abdullah ibn Omar relates: \"Once a person came to the Messenger of Allah and expressed his desire to participate in jihad in order to please Allah. The Holy Prophet asked him \"Are your parents alive:'\" The man said \"Yes. Both are alive\". The Holy Prophet said 'Then go and serve them well\". Another Bersion say that the Holy Prophet said 'Serve them and then perform Jihad\". (Bukhari and Muslim) The ahadith tell us that if one's parents need services then he must go on serving them Jihad does not become absolutely necessary (fard-e-'ain), as serving the parents is superior to Jihad. It is also widely known that Owais Qarni lived in Yaman and desired to visit the Holy Prophet. But since his mother needed his services, our Holy Prophet ordered him not to conic but to take care of his mother. Thus Owais Qarni could not visit and see the Holy Prophet; however, as a reward for his serving his mother, he was granted such a status by Allah that many important companions asked him to pray for them. When he finally came to Madinah during the Caliphate of Omar, the latter rushed to him to ask for his blessings. Serving the parents is normally easy since love for parents is but natural and one is automatically motivated to serve and help them and take care of them. Then parents love their children and do not wish to unduly trouble them, or to make them do thing that are difficult. A little service is enough to please them and earn their blessings. According to one hadith looking at parents with love has merits equal to Umrah and Haj. Thus by serving one's parents, a man can earn much merit. Our Holy and eternally blessed Prophet has said \"May that person be disgraced, may that person be disgraced who, finds either or both of hisparents in old age, and yet is not able to enter the Paradise\" (Mus2 im) It means that it is easy to earn Paradise by serving, helping and taking care of old parents, and whosoever doe not do it deserves disgrace. Mother has been given more right to children's love and service than the father. Abu Hurairah relates: \"A person came to our Holy Prophet and asked '0 Messenger of Allah! Which one among the people is most deserving of my good treatment?' The Holy Prophet replied 'Your mother!'. Then man asked, 'Then?'. The Holy Prophet again said ' Your mother'. Upon being asked the fourth time, the Holy Prophet replied, 'Your father\"'. (Bukhari and Muslim) It is on the basis of this hadith that the theologians have opined that mother has thrice the right of the father on her children. This is obviously because mother has greater responsibilities then father in bringing up and rearing children; her troubles have been especially mentioned in the Qur'an. Moreover, she needs more help in her old age than the father . This is why mother is placed higher than father by Allah. Taking care of parents is in any case one of the fundamental duties of man but taking care of them in their old age has been particularly emphasized in the Our'an. The emphasis is because in their old age, the parents are no longer able to be of any physical or monetary use for their offspring and so, often selfish children abandon them. Moreover, in advanced age, one is sometimes short tempered and their words and whims create resentment. So the Qur'an has asked us to remember how our parents cared for us when we were helpless in our infancy and how they pampered us and hence it is now our turn to pamper them, to bear with them with patience and serve them and take care of them. It is after seen that parents are ignored when they are alive and when they die, they are remembered anti it is regretted that they were ignored and no care was taken of them. But then it is too late. So every opportunity of earning for them should be taken. However, even after their death one can still go on serving the parents. Abu Usaid has related that \"One day we were with the eternally blessed Messenger of Allah when a person from (the tribe of) Bana Salmah came and asked him, '0 Messenger of Allah! Is there any way 1 can treat my parents well after death\"' the Holy Prophet replied: 'Yes. Pray for them, pray for their forgiveness, fulfil their promises after them, be courteous and kind to their relatives and respect their friends\". The methods preached by our beloved and ever- exalted Holy Prophet can always be followed."

He rode each alternately. On the way he met a peasant and asked him his and his father's name. When the peasant told him, he gave his she-ass to the peasant and also his turban. Those who were travelling with him asked ibn Omar why he had given so valuable a present to a peasant who could be pleased with an ordinary gift. Abdullah ibn Omar explained that the peasants' father was a friend of his father's and that he (ibn Omar) had heard our eternally blessed Prophet say that 'One good deed amongst others is to maintain cordial relations with the relatives of one's father\" (Muslim) Thus one very good way of increasing good deeds in one's record is to maintain cordial relations with the relatives and friends of one's parents and to treat them with respect, courtesy and consideration."

Mutual respect, love, understanding, courtesy and a mutual consideration of each other's needs plus mutual tolerance are not only a must for marital and familial bliss but also very meritorious.

'The most perfect faith have those Muslims who have better morals, and the best of these arc those who arc best for their women\" (Tirm idh i) A hadith has already been quoted which says that the food which one puts in his wife's mouth earns him merit. Another hadith goes a bit further and predicts merit even oh the sexual act of husband and wife. Some of the companions once asked the Holy Messenger of Allah, We satisfy our carnal needs; does it too carp merit'.'\" Our Holy Prophet replied, 'Tell me would it not be a sin if someone did it in the unlawful way\" Then the one who is doing it in the lawful way would certainly get its reward\". (Muslim) Another hadith tells us that when a husband, upon returning home, looks at his wife love and the wife returns his glance with love Allah looks upon both of them with Mercy. Husband and wife are always together and pass a large portion of their lives in each other's company, it is but natural for frictions to arise. If these normal misunderstandings and displeasures are allowed to degenerate into bitter quarrels and cruelty to each other, then not only are worldly pleasures destroyed but the Divine reward for mutual love is also lost. Hence Allah and his blessed Messenger have formulated for us a perfect guideline for marital bliss: it can be summarized as follows: \"Do not look at only those things which displease you; think too that the partner, who is displeasing you, has some good qualities as well. If you think of these good qualities, the good relationship with your spouse shall be restored\".

It has also been enjoined by the Holy Qur'an in several places and its merits described, for instance (A1 Nisa': 36) Show kindness unto parents and unto near kindred (A1 Nisa': I ) Be careful of your duty to wards Allah in Whom you claim your rights and to wards the womb that bore YOU Abu Hurairah relates that our Holy Prophet - may he be eternallv blessed - said that \"He who believes in Allah and in the Day of Judgement, should treat his relations well\". (Bukhari and Muslim) And according to Anas, the Holy Prophet said that * + ; @ \"He, who desires his earnings to increase and his life to be long, should treat his relations well\", (Bukhari and Muslim) Good treatment means courteous behavior, sharing in happiness and grief and helping them in a lawful manner whenever required. However some points regarding this good treatment must always to kept in mind. (1) Some people treat their relatives so well that they do not hesitate to sin for them in wrong belief that this is what has been enjoined on them. To share in sinning with a relative, to recommend them undeserving, or to get them an employment for which they are not suited etc. are all unlawful in Islam; good treatment of relatives does not encompass committing sins for them. Hence when a relative seeks helps or support for any unlawful end, a polite excuse is called for. (2) Good treatment of relatives is meritorious and rewarding only when it is motivated by the desire to earn Divine pleasure and not by any urge to show off or to keep up with others or to follow customs. Our present day society is shackled by customs and traditions; good treatment of relatives is usually motivated by the desire to save face or out of one-up manship; hence many things not really desired or liked are done due to the force of customs. Consequently, one must not allow himself to be motivated by such thoughts and if any good is done to any relative or kinsman it must be done only to earn Allah's pleasure, and with happiness and grace; nothing should be done to complete a formality or fulfil a custom. (3) Since good treatment of kinsmen should be for the sake of Divine pleasure, one must never expect or wait for a good deed in return. Even when the return is not good, ore should not abandon good treatment of his relations. Actually this is the acid test that shows whether the good treatment is for Allah or merelv for show. Our eternally Prophet has said: \"He does not treat his relations well - who merely returns a good deed; he who treats them well even when they deny his rights really treats them well\". (Sahih Bukhari) Umme Kulthum bin Aqabah has related that the eternally blessed Messenger of Allah said: \"The best sadaqah is the one given to inimical relatives (Hakim and Tabrani: A1 Targheeb wa a1 Tarheeb, p.120. volume 4). Real and true good treatment is the one given even when one's relations treat him badly; this earns much merit. Abu Hurairah relates \"Someone said to the Messenger of Allah 'I have some relatives whom I treat well, but they deny me my rights; I treat them well, but they treat me badly. I am forbearing, but they quarrel with mef. The Messenger of Allah said 'If this is really so then you are feeding them hot ashes. Allah shall always give you a helper' (Sahih Muslim). It means that they were acquiring hell fire by their deeds, and they would never harm him; rather he would be helped against them by Allah."

In fact if one's neighbor is poor or in financial straits he should be helped monetarily too. Neighbour is not necessarily one's equal in social or material sense; poor neighbours are also neighbours and they have all the more rights as they are in greater need of help and assistance, If a neighbour is hungry, it is not merely meritorious to feed him but also a bounden duty.

According to a hadith quoted by both Bukhari and Muslim, our Holy Prophet -- upon whom be peace - has said that if people knew the real reward and merit of calling to prayer, everyone would try to give the call and lots would have to be drawn. Nowadays muezzins are appointed in mosques to give the call to prayer, but if one prays at a place other than mosque where the sound of the call has not reached, he should observe sunnah by giving the call and earn the merit thereof. Abu Saeed Khudri once said to Abdullah the son of Abdur Rahman ibn Sa'sa'a \"I see that you are very fond of goats and the desert. Henceforth whenever you are among your goats or in the desert and give the call to prayer. call loudly because whosoever shall hear the call. jinns or men or other things, would bear evidence for the giver of the call on the day of Judgement. Having said this, Abu Saeed Khidri added that the had heard it from the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be eternal blessings. This shows the merits of giving the call the prayer."

Thus he who prays for Vaseela for me shall have right to my interceasing for Divine pardon.\" (Sahih Muslim) It is because of this that our blessed Prophet has taught us a prayer which includes prayer for I - 0 s : ' 0 G 1 Vaseela: 8 ' L % I ~ ~ I , , L ~ ~ ' * & ~ ~ ~ + C [Arabic Text Image] ' 0 0 B <0 0 , * , / , .

It must be read, understood and acted upon, but mere reading and reciting of Qur'an have also been designated by Allah as acts of merit that deserve rewards. Mere recital of the words of the Qur'an is enough to invoke Allah's mercy, but many think, foolishly or unknowingly that reading of Qur'an without understanding what it says is of no use. They think the Divine book is like a other books written by men which have to be understood. But Qur'an, a Divine Book, is different; it guarantees well-being and success in this life as well as the afterlife and mere reading or reciting it is in itself rewarding and meritorious. Abdullah ibn Uas'ud relates that our blessed Prophet has said ''He who reads one word of Allah's book gets one merit which is in fact equal to ten merits. I do not say that is one word, is one word, is one word and is one word\". (Tirm idh i) This shows that if anyone recites only, it is enough for thirty merits to be recorded. It also proves that mere reading or recital without understanding is also rewarding since is a word the meanings of which are unknown and so it is impossible to understand it. Thus our blessed Prophet, by giving this examples proved that reward for reading or reciting Qur'an does not depend upon understanding it, but mere reading or recital is rewarding in itself. Hence every Muslim, before busying himself with other work, must read sonic portion - one para or half or one quarter or even one ruku'of the Qur'an without fail; this shall assuredly earn him ever increasing merit every day. Moreover, every Muslim must commit to memory some surahs for ready recital without having to open the book. According to Ibn Abbas, our blessed Prophet has said ''He whose mind does not have some portion of Qur'an is like an empty house\"."

Then after reciting the whole list, our Prophet said: 'IAnd in place of all these good deeds, two rakats prayed at the time of ishraq can also suffice (Sahrh Muslim) This clearly means that these two rak'ats are equivalent to three hundred and sixty good deeds. The best way of performing Ishraqprayers is to sit in place after fajr prayers and do dhikr and then leave after saying ishraq prayers when the sum has risen. gut if one cannot follow this, then he can say ishraq prayers after coming back home or after doing something he has to do."

Our blessed Prophet has, I ordered that knife should be properly sharpened before slaughter and every care possible should be taken of the animal to be slaughtered. (Tirmidhi). Having mercy on animals, rearing them and giving them comfort is very pleasing to Allah and is very meritorious and rewarding. Our Prophet - upon whom be peace - once related a story of man of earlier ummahs: He felt great thirst during a journey. After a great search, he found a well which lacked a bucket to draw up the water. He went down into the well and slaked his thirst and came out of the well, then he saw a thirty dog licking wet earth. The man felt great pity and felt for the dog's suffering, lie took off his leather socks and, climbing down into the well, he felt them with water and climbed out with socks held in his teeth. Allah was so pleased with this act that tic pardoned him. (Bukhari and Muslim)."

This is why controlling the tongue has been much enjoined and reticence has been lauded in ahadith. Abdullah bin Masood relates that once he asked the Holy Prophet, \"Which is the best deed\"\" The Holy Prophet said Praying on time\". Then he asked 'Which act is second to it?\" The Holy Prophet said: \"That people be safe from your tongue\". (Targhib, p. .302, vol. 4. ref. Tabrani) In other words prevent your tongue from causing pain to others, from backbiting and roam cheating. I Aqabah ibn Amir asked the Holy Prophet \"What is the way to salvation?\" I He said / / D [Arabic Text Image] [Arabic Text Image] [Arabic Text Image] / /,, / ' [Arabic Text Image] -0 , ' - , \"Control your tongue and make your I house sufficient for yourself and weep ever your sins\" (Abu Daud and Tirmidhi). Making the house sufficient means that one should not unnecessarily leave his house to go out and get involved in mischief, and weeping on sins means ex pressing contrition on one's sins and seeking Divine forgiveness of them. In another hadith it is related that our blessed Prophet said to Abu Dhar Ghifari, \"Should 1 not tell you two things which sit lightly on man but are weighty in the scales (on the Day of Judgement)?. Then he said: 'Xlways be courteous and make a habit of reticence\" (Targhib, p. 312, vol. 4 ref. Tabrani, Abu Laila etc). Once our Prophet - upon whom be peace - said the same to Abu Darda' (ibid.

Ibn Omar has related the following Prophetic saying: \"When you eat, eat with your right hand and when you drink, drink with your right hand\". (Sahih Muslim) When something is distributed, it should be from the right, as this is a Prophetic custom. One should put his left foot first when entering the lavatory and his right foot when coming out. Following this sunnah shall be source of great merit.

The Holy Prophet said. 'This (tree) is like a believer who trembles with fear of Allah and so sheds his sins leaving behind only good deeds\". (A1 Targhib, p. 227. vol. S. ref. Baihaqi) To create fear of Allah, we should think of His Power and Greatness, of the straits of earlier ummahs and of the chastisement mentioned in Qur'an and hadith for the disobedient ones. This shall create Allah's fear in the heart and prevent one from wrongdoing, sinning and unlawful acts, and one shall attain piety which is the basis of all good and of deliverance and salvation in this world and in the next.

The right way is to try to reform oneself and to balance Allah's fear and good hopes from, Him.
